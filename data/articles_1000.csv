1|Facebook Friend Request Nearly Cost One North Carolina Woman Thousands|"A North Carolina woman is trying to warn others about a Facebook scam that she nearly fell victim to. It came from a friend, and it could have cost her thousands of dollars.

Cheryl Albrecht is a nutrition director at Randolph County Senior Adults Association. She recently told WGHP News about the scam that started when she received a friend request on Facebook from an elderly woman she knows.

The woman claimed to have been awarded money by the federal government.

“She had seen my name on the winners list as well and wanted to know if I’d gotten my money,” Albrecht said.

The friend told Albrecht that all she needed to do was send a friend request to a man she didn’t know and follow his instructions to collect the money. When she did, Albrecht quickly realized it was a scam.

The man first asked for additional personal information, including her home address and marital status. Then he asked her to send him $2,000 in order to collect the money.

It’s an old trick, but people still fall for it. The FBI refers to such scams as “advance fee schemes,” according to an ABC News story from earlier this year about a Texas woman who fell victim to one. The schemes involve the victim paying out money in order to collect a larger prize that doesn’t exist.

They are easy to spot, but for Albrecht, her trouble didn’t stop when she refused to pay.

“He still hounded me,” she said. “Literally, ‘do you want your money? Do you want your money?’”

As the harassment continued, Albrecht learned that the original friend request came from an account created by a person posing as the woman she knows.

The contact with the scammer stopped for a few weeks, then started again. This time it was an older scam. Albrecht was told she had won a Facebook lottery.

That scam has been around for years. It occasionally takes the form of an advance fee scheme, but the Better Business Bureau believes the scam is more about installing malware on victims’ computers through bad links included in the emails.

Luckily for Albrecht she didn’t fall for that scam either. But she wants others, particularly the seniors she works with on a daily basis, to be aware.

“That’s my concern; I didn’t want any more of my former seniors or my current seniors to be finagled out of their hard-earned money,” she said.

BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia has asked for security as the next proceedings in 2 corruption cases filed against her by the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) is approaching. Party high-ups said Khaleda Zia, also the former prime minister, has filed a general diary (GD) with Chawkbazar Police Station seeking security for her. Khaleda’s lawyer Zakir Hossain Bhuiyan applied for the safety of the BNP chief as a Dhaka court had set January 7 for the next hearing in Zia Charitable Trust and Zia Orphanage Trust graft cases. ‘When Madam (Khaleda) was on her way to the hearing of ACC at a special court in Old Dhaka’s Bakshibazar the area was under attack. There is another hearing on Jan 7 next year. We are filing the GD for security concerns,' he said. But Sub-Inspector Jalal Uddin of Chawkbazar Police Station said the GD hasn't been recorded yet. Last week, Khaleda attended the hearing in the makeshift court in Bakshibazar amid clashes between Awami League activists and BNP supporters. The hearing of the graft case is being held in that court. The hearing was deferred that day and set for Jan 7 following Khaleda's appeal, according to a news agency."

VoA - News Thursday 1st January, 2015

DAKAR/MONROVIA - The World Health Organization says the number of new confirmed Ebola cases in Liberia is ""declining."" Liberians were once at the epicenter of this regional epidemic but several parts of the country have now gone weeks without reporting any new cases. Some medical staff are returning to work amid renewed vigilance. It's an important sign of progress.

The Dolo Town Health Center, just outside the Liberian capital, is open.

Mothers bring their children for vaccinations against polio and measles.

People come in for tuberculosis treatment and HIV counseling. A midwife said she delivered ten babies since they reopened a month ago.

The sheer normalcy of it all has the feel of the remarkable.

Liberia's health system collapsed in August as Ebola bore down on Monrovia. Dolo Town was one of two suburbs put under an abrupt quarantine.

The quarantine was lifted two weeks later, but the community continued to battle Ebola. Locals say more than four dozen people are believed to have died here of the virus.

Even now at year's end, a local task force watches for sporadic cases. This newly opened clinic is not taking any chances. They built a special waiting area in front. Midwife Kebeh Karmo keeps a close watch.

""In sitting under here please we shouldn't sit jammed up beside one another because you don't know who is who. Ebola patient might be among ushellip;We are protecting you and protecting ourselves,"" she said.

Staff wear gloves. They screen for Ebola symptoms like fever and send those patients to a larger care center nearby.

The clinic has a stock of PPE's just in case. That's the full-body protective gear staff should wear if there see a suspected Ebola case.

Physician's assistant McFarland Kerkulah said getting those PPE's persuaded most of the nurses to return. ""That is why we are having the courage to work right now,"" said Kerkulah.

As Ebola surged in Liberia in mid-2014, many medical staff didn't even have gloves. More and more of them were getting sick. Health workers went on strike. Most clinics shut down. People were afraid to go the clinics still open.

It was tragedy multiplied. The government said people would die of treatable, preventable causes - childbirth complications, malaria, respiratory illness, high blood pressure.

International Ebola response ramped up in Liberia in October. At year's end, the epidemic is not over, but the worst of it may be.

A few big hospitals have reopened. Small community clinics like this one are edging open their doors.

""Good morning. I know everybody wash their hands before. If you didn't do that then you need to do that. [hearing water as people wash hands] If you didn't do it, we not allow you in,"" said Kerkulah.

Every morning, the Dolo Town Health Center gives out tickets. Staff triage cases giving priority to the most critical. This used to be a 24-hour clinic but now they see just 25 people per day. It's a safety measure. Non-urgent cases are told to return the next day.

Kerkulah is a strong believer in what he calls ""holistic care.""

""We want to say thank you for coming and we want everybody to be relaxed. Everyone will get treatment before one o'clock,"" he said.

Kerkulah says they will soon start the day's consulations but first. ""We will ask one person to give us a short song so we will start.""

And with that, a new day begins."

6|Maids in Hong Kong pass board exams and come home to teach|"By Vito Barcelo | Jan. 01, 2015 at 12:01am

At least 10 Filipino workers in Hong Kong who passed the teachers’ licensure examinations of the Professional Regulations Commission last August will be hired by the Department of Education as teachers, according to Labor Secretary Rosalinda Baldoz.

They are among more than 52,000 examinees who passed the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) on Aug. 17, 2014 in Hong Kong and 24 testing centers all over the Philippines.

“The DepEd will employ the ten former OFWs as teachers holding regular plantilla item positions,” said Baldoz who launched the program along with DepEd Secretary Armin Luistro under “Sa Pinas, Ikaw and Ma’am/Sir”, a component of the National Reintegration Program for Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW).

According to Baldoz, the teachers are Cristina B. Pimentel of Barangay Burgos, San Guillermo town, Isabela; Rosemelinda A. Castillo of Brgy. Tapel, Gonzaga, Cagayan; Bravo, Miluz of Lumbia, Cagayan de Oro City; Mary Grace A. Jimenez of Brgy. Cabaruyan, Libungan, North Cotabato; Lorna P. Tabernero, of Santol, La Union; Helen A. Nalupa of Brgy. Songkoy, Kitcharao, Agusan del Norte; Gertrudes D. Baliclic of Piddig, Ilocos Norte; Assen Shierra A. Biggayan of Brgy. Centro, Abulug, Cagayan; Mia C. Garcia of Brgy. Cristo Rey, Capaz, Tarlac; and Joan S. Kirit of Brgy. Diego Silang Village, Ususan, Taguig City.

“Most of the ten teachers have already submitted complete documentary requirements, while some are still in the process,” Bureau of Local Employement Director Nikki Tutay told Baldoz.

“They are already assured to be hired as teachers,” she said .

A Teacher I position, Baldoz said, pays an entry level salary of P20,549 a month including a Cost of Living Allowance of P2,000. With deductions of P4,049.81 which consist of income tax, GSIS, PagIBIG, and PhilHealth contribution, the take-home pay is P16,499.19.

She said perks and benefits included clothing/uniform allowance of P5,000 per year; year-end bonus equivalent to one month basic pay; cash gift of P5,000; performance bonus depending on teaching performance; and productivity enhancement of P5,000.

“Moreover, teachers also receive incentives, such as proportional vacation pay equivalent to 70 days; Christmas vacation pay equivalent to 14 days; and a chalk allowance of P1,000 per year,” Baldoz explained.

Other privileges are a one-step increment for every three years of continuous satisfactory performance; hardship allowance for teachers assigned in hardship posts (i.e., cannot be reached by regular means of transportation, but only through hiking or banca/motorcylce rides); mobile teachers and multi-grade teachers (15-25 percent of basic salary); and honoraria for teaching overload subject to funds availability.

“This pay is for single teachers. The pay for married teachers with dependents is higher a bit,” she said.

This project for domestic worker-teachers is very encouraging. It guarantees them careers in the public education system and weans them away from their previous domestic work occupations, Baldos said.

The DOLE has conceived ‘Sa ‘Pinas, Ikaw ang Ma’am Project’ to provide licensed teachers working abroad, either as domestic workers or non-teaching related occupations, to come home and teach instead.

“The DepEd has 1,300 teaching vacancies left for 2014 and 39,000 vacant teacher positions in 2015,” Baldoz said."

Talking in brief to journalists following the tea reception hosted by the BP Koirala Memorial Trust on the occasion of the 39th National Unity and Reconciliation Day here Wednesday morning, he said it is only through national unity and reconciliation that we can give stability to democracy in the country. ""Considering this, I am confident that all the party leaders would cooperate and support in promulgating the new constitution"", he said.



Prime Minister Koirala, who also chairs the Trust, said the policy of national unity and reconciliation propounded by BP Koirala could still become an effective medium of development of the country today.







Reiterating that he was confident about receiving the support and cooperation of all in the constitution making as well as accelerating development works in the country, the Prime Minister said the national unity and reconciliation day would inspire us all to take the country towards development and prosperity.



BP is regarded as synonym to democracy by many leaders in Asia and Europe, Mr Koirala said while adding that the late leader is still remembered as one who could address the problems facing a poor country like Nepal.



He also described BP Koirala as a source of inspiration for not only Nepalis but for leaders around Asia and Europe for the role he played for nation, nationality and democracy. ""BP will always remain as a memorable, respected and guiding personality"", he said.



Earlier at the program, Prime Minister Koirala unveiled the ´Bisheswar Prasad Koirala´ mahakabya or epic by Koshal Raj Poudel. The volume in Nepali language sheds light on the role played by BP in the advancement of politics, literature and overall Nepali society. RSS

9|Australia bans commercial sunbeds over cancer fears|"SYDNEY: Most Australian states and territories are set to ban commercial sunbeds from Thursday, in a crackdown on artificial tanning in a country that has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world.

The ban — which comes into force in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland and in the Australian Capital Territory on January 1 — will make Australia the second nation after Brazil to impose such a restriction, campaigners said.

Western Australia has said it would also implement a ban, though it has yet to announce a start date. There are no commercial solariums in the only other part of Australia — the hot and humid Northern Territory.

Cancer Council Australia welcomed the ban, which it has long pushed for, adding that it would help to reduce rates of skin cancer, which affects two out of three Australians by age 70.

“Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world,” advocacy director Paul Grogan said in a statement to AFP.

“Solariums expose users to extremely highly levels of UV (ultraviolet) radiation, greatly increasing their risk of melanoma and other skin cancers.”

Australia is sometimes referred to as the sunburnt country, where beaches are thronged with bathers basking under blue skies and the rates of melanoma, a potentially fatal form of skin cancer, are the highest in the world.

Public health campaigners have long pushed to promote awareness of the dangers of exposure to the sun, urging people to wear sunscreen, hats and sunglasses. They have also warned that tanning on a sunbed is not safe.

“Queensland already has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world and there is no question there’s a direct link between regular sunbed use and the incidence of malignant melanoma,” the state’s interim Health Minister Mark McArdle told Australian Associated Press.

The incidence of skin cancers in Australia is two to three times the rates in Canada, the United States and Britain, the Cancer Council said. More than 2000 Australians died from skin cancer in 2011, the majority from melanoma, which is caused by harmful ultraviolet light from the sun, the council added.

Australia’s proximity to Antarctica, where there is a hole in the ozone layer which normally filters out UV rays, also increases the risk."
10|Charter School Commission report highlights progress, challenges|"MEDIA RELEASE

The State Public Charter School Commission has presented its annual report to the State Board of Education, the third annual report by the Commission since its creation in 2012 by Act 130.

The report, which primarily provides information from the 2013-2014 school year, highlights both successes and ongoing challenges in Hawaii’s charter system.

Act 130 created the Commission with a principal focus on accountability-related authorizer functions, including the development and implementation of a rigorous accountability system that safeguards student and public interests while at the same time valuing the autonomy and flexibility of Hawaii’s public charter schools.

As part of the new system, all of Hawaii’s 34 charter schools currently operate pursuant to a three-year charter contract under which the academic, financial, and organizational performance of each school is evaluated annually.

The report includes detailed information on every individual school’s results, as well as information about how the charter sector is performing as a whole and about the challenges the schools and the system face.

“While it’s clear that much work remains to be done, overall Hawaii’s charter schools and its chartering system continue to show promising signs of improvement,” said Commission Executive Director Tom Hutton.

Among the highlights:

Academic

* As measured by the State’s Strive HI Performance System in 2013-2014, the charter schools’ collective results fell under the statewide averages on most indicators of academic performance.

* On the other hand, charter schools showed collective progress over 2012-2013 results on every Strive HI indicator except two.

* All five charter schools that had been classified in the bottom “Priority” tier under Strive HI in the previous year showed progress under Strive HI in 2013-2014, with one reclassified this year into the next highest “Focus” category.

* As measured by Strive HI, five of the state’s 11 top-performing public high schools—Myron B. Thompson Academy, Kula Aupuni Niihau A Kahelelani Aloha (KANAKA) A New Century Public Charter School (PCS), University Laboratory School, Hawaii Academy of Arts and Science (HAAS), and Halau Ku Mana Public Charter School—and two of its four top-performing public middle schools—Voyager: A Public Charter School and Innovations Public Charter School—were charter schools.

* This was the first year the Commission implemented its own Academic Performance Framework (APF), which evaluates charter schools differently than does Strive HI, including by placing heavier emphasis on proficiency and growth among high-needs students and by proportionally weighing the results for each grade level (elementary, middle, and high) for schools that serve more than one grade level.

* While it must be emphasized that these are only first-year results, under the APF, 21 schools either did not meet or fell far below the overall standard, 10 schools met the standard, and two schools—KANAKA and Ka ‘Umeke Kā‘eo—exceeded the standard.

Financial

* Financial data continue to show that charter schools generally are good stewards of public funding, a very important point in light of revelations of financial mismanagement at one school.

* While some financial indicators for charter schools collectively improved last year, the data signal longer-term sustainability challenges for charter schools if funding levels remain essentially flat and/or schools are not able to realize more cost savings.

Organizational

* This year the schools’ organizational capacities were measured primarily by whether they had some fairly basic policies and practices in place in five areas, a deliberately incremental approach that acknowledges that the schools were not asked for these things consistently under the previous law and that most are lightly staffed.

* Most schools fulfilled all or almost all of the 2013-2014 organizational measures.

* The organizational framework highlights the need for additional attention to certain issues, including the transparency of school governing boards and the securing of needed permits and certificates for charter school facilities on state lands.

“This report helps all of us take stock of where we are in implementing the vision of Act 130,” said Commission Chairperson Catherine Payne. “It’s been difficult, and we still have a long way to go, but the Commission remains committed to the hard work of ensuring that our charter schools are able to fulfill their missions and their responsibilities to the public and our keiki.”

The Commission also will deliver its annual report to the State Legislature.

13|Victor Davis Hanson|"Gasoline prices are on the verge of crashing down to below $2 a gallon. The price of oil may dip below $50 a barrel.

Even with renewed demand from a global economic resurgence, energy prices continue to fall. The U.S. has suddenly become the world's largest combined producer of oil and natural gas.

That fact -- along with a desire to weaken hostile Iran and Russia -- has prompted the oil-rich Gulf sheikdoms to keep pumping oil even as the price falls. In their game of petro-chicken, the desperate sheiks hope that either their poorer enemies will run out of cash, or that fracking in the U.S. will become unprofitable and cease.

Everyone seems to have forgotten about ""peak oil"" -- the catchphrase of the new millennium.

The world in general, and the United States in particular, supposedly had already burned more oil than was left under the Earth. Under President Barack Obama, gasoline prices had soared. When he entered office in January 2009, gas prices averaged around $1.60 per gallon. Four years later, by spring of 2013, gas prices had climbed beyond $3.50 a gallon.

The Obama administration never much worried about high energy costs. During the 2008 campaign, Obama promised that, ""Under my plan ... electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket."" Shutting down coal plants and using higher-priced but cleaner natural gas would pave the way for an even pricier mandated wind and solar generation.

In the vice presidential debates of 2008, Joe Biden mocked Sarah Palin for the supposedly mindless campaign mantra of ""Drill, baby, drill."" Biden intoned that, ""It will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to be drilled.""

The energy secretary-designate, the professorial Steven Chu, in 2008 had unwisely voiced a widely held but wisely unspoken progressive belief that, ""Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe"" -- or about $9 a gallon.

Just two years ago, when up for re-election, Obama reminded Americans, ""We can't just drill our way to lower gas prices.""

Obama ridiculed the Republican idea of lowering gas to $2 a gallon through new oil-recovery techniques. ""They're already dusting off their three-point plans for $2 gas,"" Obama mocked. ""I'll save you the suspense: Step one is drill, step two is drill, and step three is keep drilling.""

Such easy rhetoric was backed by action -- or lack of it. The Keystone XL pipeline was put on permanent hold. New fracking leases on federal lands were postponed. Huge areas of oil- and gas-rich federal lands were put off-limits. Some blue states stopped fracking. Money poured into solar schemes like Solyndra."
14|Over 1 crore LPG consumers yet to complete formality for subsidy|"Over 1 crore LPG consumers yet to complete formality for subsidy

""Maharashtra has 184.66 lakh LPG consumers, of which 83.34 lakh consumers have already become CTC,"" it said, advising the remaining consumers to register themselves.

MUMBAI: The state-run gas bottling and marketing company BPCL today said over one crore households in Maharashtra were yet to become cash transfer compliant (CTC), which is necessary to avail of LPG subsidy.

Those wishing to register need to link the Aadhar number with their bank account, or if they do not have an Aadhar yet, to link their bank account directly with their 17 digit LPG ID, a statement from BPCL said.

On joining the scheme, a consumer will have to pay for the LPG bottles at market prices, but will get the government subsidy -- Rs 568 per cylinder at present -- directly into the bank account.

The scheme was relaunched in 34 districts on November 15 and is now being rolled out across the country.

In the pilot phase, Rs 624 crore has been transfered to over 20 lakh consumers in the state, it said.

Interestingly, 12,000 citizens in the state have opted not to be a part of the scheme stating that they do not need the subsidy."
15|Hawke cabinet secretly approved guidelines for Asio to spy on Australians|"The Hawke cabinet approved guidelines for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to spy on Australians to gather foreign intelligence, newly released cabinet documents have revealed.



The cabinet agreed not to table the new powers in parliament or to allow them to be scrutinised by the newly established parliamentary joint committee on Asio.

The 1988-89 cabinet documents, released on Thursday by the National Archives, show Bob Hawke’s Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was deeply suspicious of the attorney general’s guidelines to extend Asio’s powers to cover Australian citizens but the cabinet’s security committee approved the decision.

The cabinet also approved related rules on intelligence gathered by the country’s overseas intelligence agency, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (Asis).

In 1988-89 the cold war was still alive but waning. Asio had undergone a decade of change, started by the the first royal commission in 1974, established by the Whitlam government under Justice Robert Hope. That process led to changes brought in by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act of 1979. A year after its election in 1983, Labor established a second inquiry – the royal commission into Australia’s security and intelligence agencies, also under Hope – which provoked another shakeup in national security and intelligence services.

As a result, the attorney general was given more powers over Asio and Asio was given powers to collect foreign intelligence in Australia.

Previously, warrants could not be issued for the collection of intelligence relating to foreign groups or powers from Australian citizens and permanent residents. In a submission on 2 June 1988, the attorney general, Lionel Bowen, argued this provision limited Asio’s powers, while noting it was a “sensitive subject”.

“This provision does not rule out the situation, however, where an Australian is the only practicable vehicle by which foreign intelligence information can be collected about a ‘foreign’ target,” Bowen said in the submission.

He said there could be some cases in which information about Australians was collected “incidentally or by their deliberate involvement with a target, eg an Australian citizen aiding or abetting a foreign-sponsored terrorist effort”.

But in those cases the attorney general could impose restrictions to minimise the collection or retention of such information.

Bowen argued that the Asio act required tabling of any guidelines to the director general of security, unless it would “prejudice security”. In this case, Bowen said, it would draw further attention to the new Asio powers.

“Further, publication of the guidelines would prejudice the conduct of Australia’s international affairs, because it would focus the attention of overseas countries, and foreign representation in Australia, on this aspect of Asio functions,” Bowen wrote.

But the prime minister’s department pushed back, suggesting there had not been appropriate time to consider the changes, in a familiar echo of today’s security debates. And, like today, Bowen argued the decision should be made at “an early time”.

The department noted the proposal was out of step with Hope’s royal commission finding that “communications by or with Australian citizens should not be collected and, if accidentally collected, should be destroyed”.

It also noted the proposal was at odds with the then rules on foreign intelligence gathering which “prohibit DSD [the Defence Signals Directorate] deliberately intercepting a ‘foreign communication originated by, or directed to, an Australian person’ – whether the person is in Australia or overseas – for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence (unless related to security or serious crime)”.

The department argued the proposed guidelines should be subject to further consideration but the security committee of cabinet approved Bowen’s requests for guidelines which allowed warrants to be issued for putting Australians under surveillance to gather foreign intelligence “where it cannot be reasonably collected by other means”."

Gunfire was heard near the presidential palace in the capital of Banjul on 30 December while President Yahya Jammeh was out of the country, according to press reports.

Mr. Jammeh has since returned and media suggest that the coup attempt has been thwarted with the situation in the city now “calm.”

In a statement released today, the Secretary-General’s spokesperson said Mr. Ban was “following closely” the developments in the West African country and called for all parties to “exercise restraint and to refrain from further violence.”

“Noting the seriousness of any attempt to overthrow governments by force, the Secretary-General encourages the establishment of a transparent investigation into the events of 30 December, in compliance with due process and respect for the rule of law,” the statement continued, adding that Mr. Ban urged the Government of The Gambia, and its security and defense forces “to act in full respect for human rights.”

In addition, explained the spokesperson, the United Nations would continue to “closely monitor” the situation in the country as developments unfolded and more information became available.

Also today, the Security Council was briefed in a closed-door session on the situation in Gambia."

All years are a mix of good and bad, and the proportions can change with location. Even still, some years stand out, and this was one of them: In Western New York, it has been a remarkable year. In the good way, or, as it’s known in these parts, the Pegula way. The purchase of the Buffalo Bills by Terry and Kim Pegula wasn’t the most consequential story of the year, though it’s a part of that story. Nevertheless, and without question, the deal that put the Bills in the hands of the Pegulas was the most emotionally satisfying development in Western New York in 2014. With it, a worrisome and long-standing question was satisfactorily answered: What will happen to the team, adopted by the community and fully fused into its identity, when owner Ralph Wilson died? The answer: It will stay in Western New York. The Buffalo Bills will remain the Buffalo Bills – and in that announcement, the team became an integral part of the story of this city’s economic and spiritual renewal.

Buffalo’s startling rebound That larger story is the towering event of 2014, though event is the wrong word. The year produced a percussive series of developments that sent the message: Buffalo is coming back, and the purchase of the Bills was only one part of that story. In the private sector, other developments included the rapid construction and opening of HarborCenter, a project of the Pegulas whose initial phase was completed late this year. A hotel remains under construction. The Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus continued its high-tech expansion, and not far away the Catholic Health System opened its new headquarters. Local development companies announced so many plans to convert old buildings to new uses that they almost didn’t qualify as news. But it was with a dramatic push from the public sector that this year really took off. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s Buffalo Billion took on the shape of economic reality, as heavy equipment moved on to the site of the RiverBend project, preparing to construct what will be the largest solar panel factory in the Western Hemisphere. Here. In Buffalo. Downtown, Canalside’s development took a massive step forward with the opening of the state’s largest outdoor skating rink, constructed on a site once occupied by the Erie Canal and, later, War Memorial Auditorium. The Inner Harbor welcomed a new resident, a young girl with a shark’s head, while at the Outer Harbor, plans for a new park began taking shape. Here. In Buffalo.

Wrenching events in education There was much more to the year that Buffalo blossomed, too, and not all of it on the economic front. The Buffalo School District had a wrenching year, though one that could eventually produce important changes in the district’s performance. Voters elected a reform-minded School Board and with that, the district’s mismatched superintendent, Pamela C. Brown, took her leave. While members of the board’s majority and minority factions continue to squabble, often mindlessly, relations with the State Education Department are demonstrably improved. The district and teachers union seem – maybe – to be taking a more serious approach to crafting a new contract, 10 years after the last one expired. And in what may have been a relief for the city district, Hamburg showed that educational dysfunction isn’t reserved for Buffalo. The district was enveloped in a drama over the expulsion of a board member, while then-Superintendent Richard Jetter lied to police, telling them vandals had damaged his car when, in fact, he had sideswiped a utility pole in South Buffalo. He’s out. There were other changes, too. Sen. George Maziarz, R-Newfane, announced he would not run for re-election – shortly after his aides were questioned as part of a federal investigation into operations of his office. Maziarz says the issues aren’t related, and the feds aren’t talking. North Tonawanda Mayor Robert G. Ortt was elected to succeed Maziarz."

Firefighters in Southern California completed the rescue early Wednesday of more than 180 motorists who were stranded when a winter storm brought snow to the San Bernardino Mountains.

The San Bernardino County Fire Department said in a news release that 136 people were rescued on State Highway 138 near the communities of Crestline and Mount Baldy, about 50 miles from Los Angeles.

The drivers became stuck after more than a foot of snow fell in the area, which was also swept by high winds. The rescues came as an arctic air mass mangled transportation routes and left thousands without power in the state.

Firefighters used SnowCats to navigate the steep, snowy switchbacks of Highway 138 to rescue about 50 motorists and transport them to First Baptist Church in Crestline. Red Cross workers there provided aid.

Some motorists were able to drive away as plows cleared snow away. Others abandoned their cars and walked to their homes or nearby shelters.

No serious collisions or injuries were reported.

Another 50 people were stranded in snowy conditions around Mount Baldy, with about 25 near the Mount Baldy ski area and about 25 further down the mountain near Mount Baldy Village, the department said. Eventually, about 40 people were sheltered at Mount Baldy Lodge. Others were shuttled down the hill to Fire Station 12 in San Antonio Heights.

Many stranded drivers feared they would have difficulty traversing the 10% grade and sharp turns on the descent from the Baldy ski lifts, which are located at an altitude of about 6,000 feet, KNBC-TV reports.



Rescue operations were completed by about 3 a.m. local time, the department said.

In the Sacramento area in Northern California, more than 8,000 customers were without power Tuesday afternoon because of gusty winds.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, high winds felled trees and blocked freeways. BART, or the Bay Area Rapid Transit, experienced severe delays because of trees blown onto the tracks.

Wind gusts topped 50 mph in parts of the Bay Area.

21|Proposed bill would require coroners to release autopsy results|"Proposed bill would require coroners to release autopsy results Posted: Tuesday, December 30, 2014 7:05 PM EST Updated: Tuesday, January 27, 2015 7:11 PM EST

A bill filed by state senator Larry Martin, R-Pickens, would require coroners across the state to release cause of death information when requested under a Freedom of Information Act Request.

A state supreme court ruling this past summer deemed autopsy information was protected under federal privacy laws.

But Martin said in many cases, like officer involved shootings, releasing that information as soon as possible benefits the public.

""Right now it would only become public during a judicial proceeding and that's a long period of time,"" Martin said of autopsy results. ""Particularly in cases that involve police officers, the cause of death is something the public does need to know.""

Martin said his bill does not require other non-relevant information be released.

""I have no interest in knowing the person's medical history,"" Martin said. ""Even in death the right to privacy still exists.""

Martin said even though the death of Tucker Hipps had no bearing on his decision to file the bill it would require the Oconee County Coroner Karl Addis to release the full autopsy.

Hipps' body was found in Lake Hartwell near Clemson University back in September.

Addis invoked the Supreme Court ruling from July to protect Hipps' full autopsy. However, Addis did release the cause of death as a head injury consistent with a fall.

""We may never know what went on simply by the autopsy,"" Martin said of the Hipps case. ""But often times an autopsy will give you a road map or point you in the right direction.""

FOX Carolina contacted Addis for comment but did not hear back.

An attorney for the Hipps family said they had no comment on Martin's bill.

KSL Newsradio Wednesday 31st December, 2014

SALT LAKE CITY - In 2014, the leading cause of disaster in Utah was house fires, and a similar high rate of house fires across the country has prompted a nationwide campaign to promote fire safety.

Between Jan. 1 and Dec. 1, Utah Red Cross volunteers responded to help 668 Utahns, with 232 households displaced by fire, according to a Red Cross news release. Nationally, the Red Cross responds to a disaster every eight minutes, and the majority are house fires.

""While tornadoes, floods and hurricanes tend to dominate the headlines, people often underestimate the frequency and devastation caused by home fires, and that’s where the Red Cross comes in,"" said Heidi Ruster, Utah Red Cross region CEO. ""Our work doesn’t end after the smoke clears. Every day, local dedicated volunteers are helping people recover and get better prepared.""

Due to the large number of house fires in the U.S., the Red Cross launched a campaign in October to help reduce the number of home fire deaths by 25 percent over the next five years, the news release said. The Red Cross has asked each household to check its existing smoke alarms and to practice fire drills at home.

Since October, the Red Cross and local fire departments have installed more than 17,000 smoke alarms in homes across the U.S.

23|Really, govt tech profit cash grab is a PRIZE-WINNING idea? • The Register|"Worstall on Wednesday So, that favourite of mine and of Andrew Orlowski, Mariana Mazzucato, has been awarded a prize by the New Statesman in the field of political economy.

Given that her message is that government should be getting more of the pie, that's the sort of political economy you would expect the magazine to like. However, I find there's a gaping hole or two in her arguments. I'll concentrate on just one here: her insistence that all those tech billionaires becoming plutocrats is one reason why we need the State to be taking more of what is rightfully its own as a result of the basic research that those tech billionaires are implementing.

It's an argument that can sometimes be made. Those who lobby to create legislatively crafted and protected monopolies should, to my mind, have that wealth taken off them. That's preparatory to making sure that the State never makes such monopolies again, of course. I'm perfectly happy that when Ferdinand Marcos, the father of me old schoolmate Bongbong, was president/prime minister and carved up the Philippine economy that when he lost power he and his cronies then all lost some of their money.

But that's not quite what is being said here about those tech companies. What is being said is the following:

If policymakers want to get serious about tackling inequality, they need to rethink not only areas such as the wealth tax that Thomas Piketty is calling for but the received wisdom on how to generate value and wealth creation in the first place. When we have a narrow theory of who creates value and wealth, we allow a greater share of that value to be captured by a small group of actors who call themselves wealth creators. This is our current predicament and the reason why progressive parties on both sides of the Atlantic are struggling to provide a clear story of what has gone wrong in recent decades and what to do about it.

Well, yes, possibly, but for that to be true then those innovators she's using as her examples of “wealth creators” would have to be coining it off what they're doing.

So why have we accepted such a biased story of the state’s role when, as the story of Apple shows, it has done so much more than “fix” market failures?

As she's using Apple as an example, then so shall we. And much of her book is directed at her investigation of how all of the technologies that came together in the iPhone had originally been government-funded.

Now there's no doubt that Steve Jobs (and others) did coin it out of Apple. Jobs at death was supposedly worth many billions, not all of which came from Pixar (and he made a lot less than he could have done at Apple as he got caught up in that options repricing scandal. That cost him billions alone in Apple stock*). So, he got billions, yes. But is that a greater share of value? A great share even? Or is it more like a pittance?

Fortunately we've a wonderful paper to tell us the truth here. I've mentioned it before: ""Schumpeterian profits in the US economy"".

The present study examines the importance of Schumpeterian profits in the United States economy. Schumpeterian profits are defined as those profits that arise when firms are able to appropriate the returns from innovative activity. We first show the underlying equations for Schumpeterian profits. We then estimate the value of these profits for the non-farm business economy. We conclude that only a minuscule fraction of the social returns from technological advances over the 1948-2001 period was captured by producers, indicating that most of the benefits of technological change are passed on to consumers rather than captured by producers.

So WHO is making bank?

These are Schumpeterian profits - that is, the profits from innovation. And the question is: what fraction of the total value created ends up sticking to the hands of the entrepreneurs? No, not the financiers, the stock markets (ie, your and my pension funds) but to the Steve Jobses of this world?

The answer is truly astonishing. It's under three per cent. Of course that's an average, but it's still an astonishing number. And given the size of that number it's really very difficult to say that Jobs's mountain of cash was “large”.

Finance gets a few more per cent of that value created but the vast majority of it flows through to us, the consumers. We might say it's just the satiation of lust that comes from having a new Jesus mobe. More formally, consumer surplus means that value we ascribe to whatever over the price we've had to pay for whatever. But we've also something much more with these new technologies: what we go on to do with them.

For example, with smartphones (and agreed, this is projection, it's all too new to really know yet, but we think the effect will be like that of mobiles a decade and more ago), we're pretty sure that there's going to be a boost to growth in the poorer countries simply because of the existence of smartphones. If it's the same boost we saw with the introuction of basic mobiles (opinion differs, all say it will have some, but more or less than mobiles, well, snarl at each other over that), then for every 10 per cent of the population in a country without a decent computer/internet network, we should expect growth of 0.5 per cent in GDP per annum.

That's simply a vast number. Say the developing world is 10 per cent of the global economy: we're talking about a $35bn addition to human income for every 10 per cent of the population that gets equipped - each year, for every 10 per cent. That Steve Jobs ended up with however many billions it simply a capital sum - a once-off - that simply pales into insignificance beside that.

Or, as we might put it, Professor Mazzucato doesn't seem to understand the economics of who gets the money from innovation - which isn't all that useful an attribute in someone who wants to tell us all about the economics of innovation, is it now?

By the way, no one over on this free market side of the argument is trying to insist that Steve-o deserved all that money, not at all. We're only making the observation that if we allow someone who has increased global growth rates so markedly to keep his pile of cash, then this will encourage the next person with an idea that might boost global growth rates to get on with it. This is not a moral nor justice ""deserved rewards"" style argument. It's a purely utilitarian one regarding incentives that induce people to try.

And yes, economics is is all about incentives and perhaps we might expect a professor of the subject to grok that. ®

Bootnote

* For those who don't know it, a company can issue options to anyone it likes at any price it likes. However, if those options are in the money at issue (ie, at a lower price than the market stock price) then the amount they are in the money must be an expense against the profit and loss statement of the company (and also taxed as income to the option recipients). But number of companies decided to issue stock options on, for example, 15 Jan, but price them at whatever had been the lowest price of the last 30 days. Apple got caught up in this, issuing in the money options which didn't go through the P&L and didn't pay income tax, Jobs then declined that award of options and that lost him - or rather, failed to earn him - a number of billions.

25|Killing of eight in Canada a 'deliberate' attack -police|"Source: Reuters - Wed, 31 Dec 2014 20:22 GMT

Author: Reuters

(Adds quotes, background throughout)

By Scott Haggett

CALGARY, Alberta, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The suspected killer of eight people in Edmonton, Canada, had a criminal record dating back to 1987 and used a stolen handgun in the murders before killing himself in domestic violence that was ""planned, deliberate and targeted,"" police said.

Police found one victim's body on Monday and the remaining seven at a house elsewhere early on Tuesday. The killer committed suicide in a Vietnamese restaurant 19 miles (30 km) northeast of Edmonton, the capital of Alberta.

Authorities disclosed the name of the first victim, Cyndi Duong, 37, but said no other identities would be made public until autopsies were carried out on New Year's Day. The dead included two children.

Investigators have identified the suspected killer as 53-year-old Phu Lam, the Edmonton Journal reported, quoting unidentified sources. It said he was the co-owner of the house where the seven victims died.

Local media quoted neighbors as saying the gunman worked as a maintenance man at the restaurant where he died and had a history of being confrontational. Police said the weapon, a 9-mm pistol, was legally registered in British Columbia in 1987 and stolen in 2006.

Police said on Wednesday the eight murders and one suicide made the mass killing the deadliest in the history of the city incorporated in 1904. Edmonton, population 878,000, recorded 27 homicides in 2013 and 27 in 2014 prior to the killings.

Police Chief Rod Knecht characterized the murders as premeditated domestic violence - he used the words ""planned, deliberate and targeted"" to describe the attack - and said there was no apparent link to drugs or gang activity.

""This is a horrific event for the city and in my 39 years of policing I've never seen anything like it,"" he told a news conference late on Tuesday.

Thanh Le, senior pastor at the Edmonton Vietnamese Alliance Church attended by Duong, her three children and parents, said her death had devastated the congregation. ""It has shocked us,"" he said. ""There have been a lot of tears.""

There are about 220,000 Vietnamese Canadians, according to the federal government, many of whom arrived as refugees in 1979 and 1980. Edmonton's Vietnamese community is one of the five largest in Canada. (Additional reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson and Howard Goller)"

BUNDA MP Stephen Wassira has order a quick financial audit on funds released for development projects in Mihingo and Mekomariro villages following complaints from residents that some village authorities may have embezzled the money.

Mr Wassira, who is also the Minister of State in the President's Office (Coordination and Relations) made the order while addressing residents during a public rally in Mihingo Village, adding that complaints from residents cannot be ignored.

The legislator said Bunda District Council authorities have a noble duty to ensure all public resources disbursed to villages are accounted for, for the benefit of the masses, to help them access basic services such as clean water, school and health.

Earlier during the course of his address, residents complained that the village authorities have not accounted for money collected from voluntary contributions at homestead levels and meant for the construction of a staff house at the village dispensary.

""The authorities have not even read out the expenditure and income reports from what they collected for the construction of science laboratories at Mihingo and Mekomariro secondary schools,"" said one resident identified as Manyama.

He complained that following the development, some locals have boycotted to contribute towards development projects.

Responding, Mr Wassira said the residents' contributions, constituency basket fund and council funds in question, need auditing.

In a separate development, the legislator pledged to contribute a total of 1m/- to help boost the construction of science laboratory at Mihingo Secondary School."

Reuters / * Loan volumes 25 pct up on 2013 total



* M&A financing doubles to $211.2 bln y-o-y



* Refinancing still dominates lending activity (Adds details)



By Alasdair Reilly and Claire Ruckin



LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Syndicated lending in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) reached $1.2 trillion in 2014, the highest annual total since 2007 and 25 percent up from $930 billion in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.



Lending activity was buoyed by the return of acquisition financing and record refinancing.



M&A loan volume of $211.2 billion was more than double the $100.2 billion raised in 2013, as confidence grew among borrowers to make debt financed acquisitions, while strong bond and equity markets gave lenders the comfort of quick repayments through the capital markets.



""The emergence of M&A was healthy and had been a long time coming. There was fresh blood brought to the market with new deals,"" a loan syndicate head said.



A 12.5 billion euro ($15.17 billion) loan backing German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen's acquisition of US rival TRW Automotive was the largest loan of the year. The underwritten financing closed oversubscribed in October, underlining the market appetite for drawn term debt.



In line with other large M&A transactions, the loan included a sizeable $9.3 billion-equivalent bridge loan.



German drugs and chemicals firms Merck KGaA and Bayer also tapped the market in 2014 for jumbo acquisition loans.



Merck backed its acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich in the US with an underwritten $15.6 billion financing that included an $11.6 billion bridge loan and closed in October.



Meanwhile, Bayer agreed a $14.2 billion loan in June, backing its acquisition of US-based Merck & Co's consumer care business. The financing comprised a $12.2 billion bridge loan and a $2 billion medium-term facility.



In September, British cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco closed $13.1 billion of loans for its acquisition of brands and assets from Reynolds American and for refinancing. The deal included a $4.1 billion bridge loan.



RECORD REFINANCING



The main driver of activity in 2014 remained refinancing, which made up 68 percent of total loan volume.



Refinancing reached $798.3 billion in 2014, the highest on record as many of Europe's largest borrowers returned to the market to refinance or amend and extend existing facilities. High levels of market liquidity and competition between banks saw many borrowers return early to refinance existing deals well ahead of their scheduled maturities on better terms.



With banks aggressively bidding to win mandates, loan pricing remained under pressure. Average margins for single-A rated companies fell to 20bp by the end of the year, while average triple-B margins remained at 50bp.



""The refinancings we've seen this year are all tightly priced, pure relationship plays with very high hit rates,"" a senior banker said.



Diversified natural resource company Glencore tapped the market in June for a $15.3 billion refinancing as it continued its trajectory away from a pure trade and commodity player, achieving cheaper pricing than on the $17.3 billion facility it arranged in 2013.



Nestle also returned to the market in 2014, closing an increased 6 billion euro refinancing of its one-year facility from 2013 and extending its 5 billion euro, five-year facility by another year.



Other sizeable refinancings were seen for Vitol, Shell , Volkswagen and GDF Suez.



With the main wave of refinancing over, banks will now be focussed on increased levels of M&A and other non-core market segments like trade finance and infrastructure financing.



Loan volume in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEEMEA) fell 23.5 percent to $145.5 billion in 2014 from $190.4 billion in 2013, driven by the collapse of the Russia loan market as a result of Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's role in Ukraine's crisis and plunging oil prices.



Lending to Russian borrowers -- traditionally the largest market in the CEEMEA loan market -- hit a ten-year low of $12.3 billion in 2014, 74 percent down from $47.2 billion raised in 2013.







LEVERAGED M&A PICKUP



M&A also fuelled an increase in activity in Europe's leveraged loan market, which rose 4.9 percent to $200.8 billion in 2014 year-on-year, the highest volume since the financial crisis.



Some $61 billion were acquisition-related, making up 30.3 percent of leveraged loan volume, up from 23 percent in 2013 and 17.9 percent in 2012, according to the data. Of all leveraged M&A volume, just under half (44.2 percent) was for corporate leveraged borrowers rather than sponsors, compared to 34.6 percent in 2013.



After ZF Friedrichshafen, the second largest European leveraged loan of 2014 was a 6.8 billion euro loan for DE Master Blenders, which refinanced debt and helped fund a merger of its coffee business with that of Mondelez into a combined company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The euro loan formed part of a wider 7.6 billion euro-equivalent financing.



A 2.85 billion euro loan, which included 1.9 billion euros of term loans, backing French telecoms operator Numericable's acquisition of rival firm SFR, was Europe's largest-ever covenant-lite leveraged loan. The loan formed part of a wider 4.7 billion euro-equivalent dual-denominated leveraged loan for the company, which in turn formed part of a wider $21.9 billion loan and bond financing.



""M&A has come back. 2015 will be another record year again as more M&A activity is expected next year,"" a lawyer said.



BNP Paribas once again topped the EMEA syndicated loan bookrunner league table, with a $55 billion share of the market from 249 deals. Deutsche Bank was a close second, with $54.6 billion and 151 deals, while Citigroup was third, with $40.2 billion and 113 deals.

29|China promotes governor of troubled Xinjiang to top energy post|"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has promoted the ethnic Uighur governor of the troubled far western region of Xinjiang to the country's top energy policy body, Chinese media reported on Wednesday, but left unclear who would replace him.

Nur Bekri will become director of the National Energy Administration, and also a deputy head of the planning body the National Development and Reform Commission, respected business magazine Caixin said on its website.

Nur Bekri will be one of the few ethnic minorities to assume a senior position in central government, underscoring his loyalty to the party where top posts are almost all held by majority Han Chinese.

The official Xinjiang Daily said Nur Bekri's position as Xinjiang's deputy Communist Party boss would be taken by Shohrat Zakir, a former mayor of regional capital Urumqi.

It did not say if he would also assume the position of governor, but as deputy party chief, he would be an obvious candidate.

Xinjiang, home of the Muslim Uighur people, has been racked by violence blamed by the government on Islamist extremists who want to set up an independent state called East Turkestan. Hundreds have died in the last two years or so.

The Xinjiang Daily quoted the region's party chief Zhang Chunxian as praising Nur Bekri as an ""outstanding ethnic minority cadre"" with all the qualifications for leadership and someone who has made ""important contributions"" to Xinjiang's stability.

""On big issues of right and wrong he is clear-headed and makes public his stance,"" Zhang said.

Xinjiang, energy-rich and strategically located on the borders of central Asia, Pakistan, India and Afghanistan, is crucial to China's growing energy needs as well as its security.

Nur Bekri's appointment highlights the importance of Xinjiang as an energy hub, well-endowed with oil, gas, coal and minerals. But it remains too early to judge whether it signals the start of a drive to open up the tightly state-controlled energy sector.

""Xinjiang is potentially a major energy province, and as the chairman of the region he certainly is the most experienced in its energy business,"" said Lin Boqiang, director of the China Centre for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University.

30|Congressman: Government Should Track Police Deadly Force Cases|"Over the past few months, police use of excessive force has been a hot topic across the country with deaths of unarmed black men from Ferguson, Missouri to a Walmart in Ohio to New York City.

These incidents have brought into question whether or not deadly force was necessary and if race played a role in the deaths. But one the one thing that has surprised many people is there is no official database documenting police use of excessive force.

Democratic Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee has proposed a bill that would require law enforcement to collect data on deadly force incidents and report it to the Justice Department to be recorded in a national public database.

“When you take all the cases in the country together — which is over a hundred a year — you can draw some conclusions,” Cohen told Here & Now’s Robin Young about the need for the database.

The data would record both the demographics of the officer and the victim to determine whether there is a racial disparity in deadly force incidents.

In addition, Cohen says Congress is working on a bill to address other issues in the criminal justice process used to bring charges against officers, including the need for an independent prosecutor.

“It’s an inherent conflict of interest for the [district attorney] — who generally prosecutes this type of crime — and always has law enforcement officers as witnesses, and the D.A.s are lax to prosecute a law enforcement person,” Cohen said.

Cohen says he recognizes the dangers of police work, but he also recognizes that many African-Americans — including those in his district — don’t feel comfortable interacting with police.

“I am pro good police. And if there is a bad policeman who uses unnecessary force, they need to be disciplined,” Cohen said. “Most cops are great people — community policing needs to be more used so that officers come in contact with people in the neighborhood and are seen as good guys. And they are good guys, but they need to be seen that way.”

31|Public scorn greets LG and Samsung's storm in a washing drum, Technology|"South Korea's two top technology firms, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, have a history of bitter rivalry, but their latest spat over a handful of washing machines has prompted a barrage of public mockery.

[SEOUL] South Korea's two top technology firms, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, have a history of bitter rivalry, but their latest spat over a handful of washing machines has prompted a barrage of public mockery.

""This is all so petty and juvenile,"" a reader on online portal Naver said of the dispute, which began in September when Samsung accused LG executives of damaging its washing machines at stores in Germany ahead of an industry event.

LG agreed to pay for what it called accidental damage to four machines following mediation by German authorities, but couldn't resist taking a pot shot at its rival's build quality.

Samsung railed against those ""slanderous claims"" and filed a formal complaint at home, triggering a raid of LG offices by Seoul prosecutors on Friday and a travel ban on LG's head of household appliances.

""This is a mudslinging match,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of corporate watchdog CEO Score. ""Both Samsung and LG will have a hard time getting the public to understand why things have gone on this way, and there is not a single thing for either party to gain from this.""

That bemusement, punctuated by a collective snicker, found a voice online. ""If all that has been said is true, then this is nothing but a petty dispute you'd expect from street corner shops and not global companies,"" said a reader on the Nate portal.

On the streets, too, the comments were scathing.

""This incident shows the problem with the corporate culture in South Korean conglomerates,"" said Lee Hyeon-woo, an office worker in Seoul. ""The mentality of these companies is not 'We're number one' but 'We must take down rival X'.""

The cross-town rivals compete on several fronts, especially televisions and home appliances, and have a history of feuding.

They have quarrelled publicly over whose refrigerator could hold more, and who had a bigger share of the domestic air conditioning market, and current and former workers say they routinely spy on each other at trade shows.

Samsung declined further comment. LG said it has been cooperating with prosecutors, who would not disclose details of the investigation.

Neither company appears ready to let the matter drop. LG has filed its own complaint with prosecutors accusing Samsung employees of deliberately concealing and tampering with evidence.

Their energy would be better spent responding to the challenge from Chinese competitors, said another exasperated commenter on Naver. ""What are you people doing?"" the person asked.

32|2-year-old in mom's fatal Wal-Mart shooting 'unzipped' special purse gun pocket|"Terry Rutledge said his 29-year-old daughter-in-law did not put the weapon ""loosely into her purse.""

Victoria Rutledge had a concealed weapons permit, and guns were a big part of Rutledge's life, her father-in-law said.

""She was not the least bit irresponsible,"" Terry Rutledge said, in a brief interview with The Associated Press. He complained about people using the incident to attack his daughter-in-law.

Terry Rutledge told The Washington Post that Veronica Rutledge and her husband practiced at shooting ranges and each had a concealed weapons permit. He said for Christmas this year, her husband gave her the purse with a special zippered pocket for a concealed weapon.

About 7 percent of adults in Idaho had concealed weapons permits at the end of 2012, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. That ranked Idaho among the top third of states.

Kootenai County, which has about 140,000 residents, has issued close to 16,000 concealed weapons permits, Kootenai County sheriff's spokesman Stu Miller said Wednesday.

""It's very commonplace in northern Idaho for folks to have a concealed weapons permit,"" Miller said, and most businesses do not prohibit firearms.

Veronica Rutledge lived in Blackfoot, in southeastern Idaho, and her family had come to the Hayden area to visit relatives for Christmas.

She was an employee of the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho, where she was a nuclear scientist. The laboratory supports the U.S. Department of Energy in nuclear and energy research and national defense.

""We're deeply saddened by this tragedy,"" said Nicole Stricker, a spokeswoman for the lab.

Rutledge graduated from high school in Harrison, a lakeside town in the Idaho Panhandle. She was the valedictorian of her class. She graduated from the University of Idaho with a degree in chemistry.

She had taken the children to Wal-Mart on Tuesday morning to spend their Christmas gift cards, family members said. Her young son, her only child, was in a shopping cart.

Responding deputies found Rutledge dead in the electronics section of the Wal-Mart in Hayden, a rural town of about 12,000 people 40 miles northeast of Spokane.

Colt Rutledge, 32, arrived at the store in Idaho's northern panhandle shortly after the shooting around 10:20 a.m. Tuesday, Miller said. All the children were taken to a relative's house.

Officers viewed surveillance video provided by the store to determine what happened, Miller said."

Deputies reached out to the U.S. Marshals Service for help locating Tyree Lavoris Johnson, 30, Miquel Innecentzo Thornton, 19, and Kendarious Devan Lucious, 19. On Wednesday they reached out to the public for assistance.

Anyone with information on their whereabouts can contact the Washington County Sheriff's Office at 251-847-2202.

According to deputies, Thornton and Johnson may be traveling together in the Mobile area. Records from Mobile County Metro Jail show police arrested Johnson, of Chatom, on charges of second-degree burglary and second-degree robbery on Oct. 16. He was released on bail three days later.

Johnson faces one count of distribution of a controlled substance in Washington County.

Thornton, also of Chatom, is wanted on four counts of distribution of a controlled substance. Authorities booked him into the Baldwin County Corrections Center on one count of possession of a controlled substance on April 18. He was released from jail May 2.

Lucious may be in the Citronelle or Mobile area, Washington County deputies said. Records show he was arrested by Citronelle police in October 2013 on third-degree burglary and criminal mischief charges. At the time, he listed his home address in Citronelle.

Lucious is wanted on one count of second-degree robbery."

37|Nigeria: German Engineers Shot Dead in Nigeria, According to Reports|"The German Foreign Office has disclosed that two Germans have been killed in Nigeria. The men were shot dead last Saturday while making a private outing on a motorbike, according to northern German newspaper.

The Ostsee Zeitung newspaper on Wednesday identified the men as engineers aged 34 and about 20 who worked for the large Nigerian construction company Julius Berger.

Both originated from Germany's northeastern state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the newspaper said.

The Foreign Office provided no further details, saying the German embassy in Abuja was seeking clarification in close contact with Nigerian authorities.

A source at Julius Berger's head office in Abuja told Deutsche Welle ""two expatriate Germans"" were killed last Saturday while riding a motorcycle near the capital.

Previous incident

Last October, gunmen shot dead a German construction expert in Nigeria's southwestern state of Ogun while Julius Berger employees were being driven to work.

A second German, a sub-contractor to Julius Berger, was abducted by the gunmen and released a week later.

40|Tropical depression Jangmi torn apart by wind shear near Philippines|"Satellite equipment that captures high-resolution photos of weather systems has spotted a wind shear credited with breaking apart a tropical depression after it crossed the southern and central Philippines.

Tropical depression Jangmi encountered the moderate to strong southeasterly vertical wind shear in the Sulu Sea, and NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite captured photos of the phenomenon on Wednesday.

When it was a stronger tropical storm, Jangmi generated flooding blamed for the deaths of 31 people in the Philippines on Tuesday.

The storm was pounding the coastal areas of Sabah, Malaysia's easternmost state, on Wednesday as it churned in the Sulu Sea between Malaysia and the Philippines.

But because of the shear, NASA believes the storm's centre never made it to Palawan, a large Philippine island to the north of Malaysia bordering the Sulu Sea.

The NPP (National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite passed over Jangmi early Wednesday morning and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument image revealed the effects of wind shear, NASA said.

""The VIIRS image showed that the north, northeastern and eastern quadrants of the storm were almost devoid of clouds and showers, as they were being pushed to the northwest and west of the centre. Those thunderstorms northwest of the centre were weakening. Some of the thunderstorms were being pushed to the northwest and over the island of Palawan,"" NASA said.

Wind shear occurs when there is a change of wind speed or direction along either vertical or horizontal distances. Vertical shear typically occurs near the surface and can influence the strength of a storm.

""JTWC [Hawaii-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center] noted that upper-level analysis indicates the system has moved into a hostile environment with moderate to high southeasterly vertical wind shear,"" the space agency said.

The warning centre's forecasters expect Jangmi to dissipate within a day.

The NPP satellite was launched in October 2011 to gather data for both short-term weather forecasting and long-term climate monitoring."
41|Sandusky's bicentennial commission takes shape|"Sandusky's bicentennial commission takes shape

Sandusky was founded in 1818 — 15 years after Ohio became a state.

There's another important date looming — 2018, the bicentennial of Sandusky's founding.

The commission that's supposed to help Sandusky celebrate its anniversary is starting to take shape.

The commission's chairman is Sandusky dentist Dr. William Semans.

The Sandusky city commission recently named six other members of the bicentennial commission after getting a list of suggestions from Semans:

• Lee Ann Alexakos, vice president of community relations at Cedar Fair.. Sandusky is her hometown. Her father's family, who were in the wine business, settled on Kelleys Island in 1872.

• Molly Carver, the new director of Sandusky Library. The library maintains a local history museum, Follett House Museum, has extensive history archives and maintains a Sandusky history blog. Carver is a Sandusky High School graduate.

• Carl McGookey, CPA, president and managing partner of Payne Nickles & Company. He's a Sandusky native and a Bowling Green State University graduate.

• Jim Miller, president, chairman and CEO, The Citizens Banking Co. in Sandusky.

• Geoffrey Oglesby, a Sandusky attorney. Sandusky is his hometown; he's a graduate of Sandusky High School and The Ohio State University.

• Luvada Wilson, Erie County clerk of courts. She has deep roots in Sandusky, too — she's also a graduate of Sandusky High School. She's also a graduate of Spellman College and the University of Toledo College of Law.

The seven commission members will appoint several more members, ex officio mayor Dennis Murray Jr. said in an email to the Sandusky Register. The group can appoint up to 10 additional members, Semans said.

Semans said he'd like to get the subcommittees formed in 2015 and said fundraising will be important.

""We won't know what we can do until we know what kind of monies we have,"" he said.

Semans is a Sandusky native. Not counting college and dental school and a stint in the Navy, he's spent all of his life in Sandusky.

Murray said a few weeks ago that he's eager for the commission to get started.

""They really need to get their work going next year in earnest,"" Murray said. ""We're not looking at just the events that will occur in 2018.""

""There's been talk about perhaps having a bicentennial park,"" Murray said. ""Whether that materializes or not, that's up to the commission."""
42|Fairmont: Ont SCJ unwinds share redemption and substitutes loan arrangement|"Canada December 30 2014

The common law doctrine of rectification operates to correct mistakes in transactions that produce (or may produce) unintended and adverse tax results. This was established in the landmark case of Juliar et. al. v A.G. (Canada) (50 O.R. 3d 728) (Ont. C.A.) (Dentons was counsel to the successful taxpayers).

In Fairmont Hotels Inc. et al. v A.G. (Canada) (2014 ONSC 7302) the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has provided another example of the manner in which rectification can be used to unwind certain impugned steps in a transaction and substitute the proper steps that accord with the parties’ intention to avoid tax.

Legacy Hotels REIT owned a collection of hotels, which were purchased from Fairmont in or around 1997. Fairmont continued to manage these hotels. In 2002 and 2003, Fairmont was involved in the financing of Legacy’s purchase of two hotels in Washington and Seattle. Through the use of several reciprocal loans between Legacy, Fairmont and several subsidiary companies, Legacy purchased the Washington hotel for $67 million USD and the Seattle hotel for $19 million USD. Fairmont hedged its loans to eliminate or reduce its foreign exchange tax exposure in Canada.

In 2006, Fairmont was acquired by two companies and its shares ceased to be publicly traded. This acquisition of control could have frustrated the parties’ intention that no entity would realize a foreign exchange gain or loss in connection with the reciprocal loan arrangements. A tax and accounting plan was created that would have allowed the companies to complete the acquisition and continue the full hedge of the foreign exchange exposure. However, this plan was modified before implementation with the result that certain foreign exchange exposure was not hedged.

In 2007, Legacy asked Fairmont to terminate the reciprocal loan arrangements on an urgent basis so that the Washington and Seattle hotels could be sold. A Fairmont officer mistakenly believed that the original 2006 plan had been implemented (i.e., the plan that continued the full hedge of the foreign exchange exposure) and agreed to the unwinding of the loans (which involved the redemption of certain preferred shares of the subsidiaries involved in the loan arrangements). Subsequently, the CRA reviewed the transactions and reassessed on the basis that the 2007 share redemptions triggered a foreign exchange gain.

Fairmont brought an application to rectify the 2007 share redemptions and to substitute a loan arrangement. Fairmont argued that its intent from 2002 was to have the original reciprocal loan arrangements unwound on a tax-neutral basis. In response, the Crown argued that Fairmont had never intended the proposed substituted loan arrangement and thus was engaged in retroactive tax planning.

Fairmont relied on the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in Juliar for the principle that the exact method to achieve a common intention to avoid tax is not required at the time of the transaction. In response, the Crown argued that the Alberta Court of Queens’ Bench in Graymar Equipment (2008) Inc. v A.G. (Canada) (2014 ABQB 154) had been critical of Juliar and had stated that rectification is granted to restore a transaction to its original purpose and not to avoid an unintended effect.

However, in the present case, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice stated that, unlike the Alberta court, Ontario courts “do not have the luxury of ignoring” the Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision in Juliar. Further, the Ontario court stated that the Alberta court had not accurately described what happened in Juliar, and that another recent Alberta decision had in fact followed the reasoning in Juliar.

In the present case, the Ontario court held that Fairmont’s intention from 2002 was to carry out the reciprocal loan arrangements on a tax- and accounting-neutral basis so that any foreign exchange gain would be offset by a corresponding foreign exchange loss. This intention remained unchanged when Fairmont was sold in 2006 and when the reciprocal loans were unwound in 2007. A mistake had caused the unintended tax assessments.

The Court also stated that this was not a situation in which the taxpayer was engaging in retroactive tax planning after a CRA audit. The parties intended to unwind the loans on a tax-free basis.

The Court allowed the application and rectified the corporate resolutions as requested. The Court awarded $30,000 of costs to the Applicants."

44|Hacker Clones Fingerprint From Photograph|"Biometric security is under the spotlight after a hacker claimed to have “cloned” the thumbprint of the German defence minister using nothing more than commercial software and a photograph.

The development, if proven, will worry experts already concerned at the security implications of using fingerprints for authentication purposes.

Cloned Fingerprint

The fingerprint claim was made by a member of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) hacker network. According to the BBC, Jan Krissler said he replicated the fingerprint of German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen using high res pictures taken with a “standard photo camera”.

A YouTube video of his demonstration (in German) is available here.

Krissler is also known as Starbug and was speaking at a convention for members of the CCC. He reportedly said he had no physical print from von der Leyen, but has suggested that “politicians will presumably wear gloves when talking in public” after hearing about his research.

It is not known at this stage if he managed to produce an exact replicate of the German politician’s fingerprint.

Krissler claimed to have obtained a copy of von der Leyen’s fingerprint using a close-up photo of her thumb during a press conference. He also used other pictures taken at different angles to build up her fingerprint using software called VeriFinger.

Fingerprint identification is used as a security measure on a number of mobile handsets, but for years now experts have warned that fingerprints are not particularly secure.

Fingerprint Hacks

In September for example, mobile security firm Lookout warned that the iPhone 6 could be hacked with a fake fingerprint.

Lookout revealed how a fingerprint of the phone user from a glass surface was photographed – first with 2,400 dots per inch (dpi) resolution. The image was then tidied up, inverted and laser-printed at 1,200dpi onto a transparent sheet with a thick toner setting. Next, white woodglue was smeared into the pattern created by the toner on the sheet. Once set, the print was lifted from the sheet, breathed on to add some moisture, then placed onto the sensor to unlock the phone. Lookout’s recommendation is to introduce two-factor authentication.

And earlier in the year, ethical hackers showed how simple it was to bypass Samsung Galaxy S5 fingerprint authentication. The researchers from Security Research Labs (SRLabs) re-used a fingerprint mould from their exploitation of the Apple iPhone 5S in 2013, which required “no additional effort whatsoever”. The fake print was based on a camera phone photo “of an unprocessed latent print on a smartphone screen”.

“Biometrics that rely on static information like face recognition or fingerprints – it’s not trivial to forge them but most people have accepted that they are not a great form of security because they can be faked,” cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University was quoted by the BBC as saying.

“People are starting to look for things where the biometric is alive – vein recognition in fingers, gait [body motion] analysis – they are also biometrics but they are chosen because the person has to be in possession of them and exhibiting them in real life,” he reportedly said.

45|Calculating AirAsia payouts for victims: A grim task|"Like in any plane crash, the tragedy over AirAsia Flight 8501 now leads to the horrific task of determining how to compensate the families of the victims.

International treaties play a role. Families can also pursue potentially larger claims through the courts. And where victims file lawsuits can play a significant role in determining compensation.

AirAsia Flight 8501, which left Indonesia for Singapore with 162 people on board, disappeared Sunday for reasons that have yet to be determined. Debris from the plane was found in the waters off Indonesia on Tuesday, and rescue officials have started recovering bodies.

The compensation process tends to be long. In the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which went missing in March, families have received some initial payments but final amounts have yet to be settled.

What can Flight 8501 families expect? This week, legal experts said it's too soon to determine how much survivors of the victims of AirAsia Flight 8501 will be compensated.

Insurance companies, which typically make the payments, use a range of factors in their calculations. The formula includes pain suffered by those on board, as well as their age, any dependents and their earning potential.

""It's difficult to come up with a number but a good average in this part of the world would be $2 million or $3 million per passenger -- that's a fairly conservative estimate,"" said Peter Schmitz, global aviation practice leader at insurance company Aon.

Schmitz gave an initial estimate for total loss at about $200 million. But he also said his forecast could vary by as much as $100 million, as more is learned about the passenger makeup and crash.

The costs are typically borne by a number of insurance companies because of a practice called reinsurance. Essentially, the risk that one company would have to make a huge payment is spread out among numerous insurers. In the case of AirAsia 8501, German giant Allianz is the lead reinsurer.

How do the treaties work? An international treaty known as the Montreal Convention creates a system of airline liability for injuries and deaths. It guarantees a minimum level of compensation for families -- currently about $174,000.

But the Montreal Convention is only valid in countries that have ratified it. Indonesia, the departure country for AirAsia 8501, never signed it.

That could make it difficult, but not impossible, for families to invoke it.

Aviation lawyer Brian Alexander, partner at Kreindler & Kreindler, explained that since Singapore is a party to the 1999 Montreal Convention, any passenger traveling round trip to and from Singapore would be covered.

There's also another treaty in play: The Warsaw Convention, an older agreement that Indonesia has ratified. But it sets a lower payout, said aviation attorney Mike Danko.

However, AsiaAir could decide to offer settlements above and beyond either treaty, perhaps in exchange for a pledge not to sue the airline for more damages.

""Typically it's such a public relations nightmare not to offer a higher amount,"" Danko said.

In fact, AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes reportedly told media earlier this week that the airline will provide ""some financial assistance"" and not ""hide behind any convention,"" according to the Wall Street Journal.

AsiaAir did not respond to a request for comment on the compensation issue.

Will cases end up in U.S. courts? Families can also bring cases against an airplane's manufacturer or another third party if evidence supports the claim, according to Alexander.

And where a claim is filed could dramatically alter the level of compensation.

""A U.S. court might set fair compensation for the loss of a spouse at several million dollars,"" wrote Danko in a blog post, ""but an Indonesian court is likely to set fair compensation at far less.""

Because neither the carrier nor manufacturer are American companies, and none of the passengers have been identified as American, odds are this disaster won't go before a U.S. court, experts said.

But if a link to the U.S. can be established -- for example, if a part of the plane determined to have caused the accident was made in America -- that could open the door to the American legal system, said Danko.

""You could attempt to sue the manufacturer in the U.S. and get a court to evaluate your loss. Your best bet at getting the highest compensation for a wrongful death is here in the U.S.,"" he said.

46|YEAR IN REVIEW: NZ stock investors ride wave of new listings|"The New Zealand stock market welcomed 16 companies to the bourse in 2014, raising $8.3 billion in equity capital and trumping a 2013 year that had been the busiest for listings in a decade.

Initial public offerings added $6.6 billion of new capital to the stock market this year existing listed companies raised more than $1.7 billion via 165 capital raisings. Investors were drawn to a market where the benchmark NZX 50 Index is heading for an 18 percent annual gain, the third straight year of double-digit growth.

""It's many, many, many more than we've had for many years, if not ever,"" said Mark Lister, head of private wealth research at Craigs Investment Partners. ""So, lots of new companies coming to market and the market is performing very, very well.""

The performance of the new listings has been mixed, with eight of the 16 up on the year, seven down and one unchanged. The biggest gainer was mobile payment app developer Pushpay Holdings, which advanced 84 percent to $2.73 since listing in August, followed by a 49 percent gain in cinema software Vista Group International, up 49 percent to $3.80 since its August debut, and a 40 percent rise to 28 cents for NZAX-listed Lateral Corp, whose mobile technology directly charges services to a customer's phone bill rather than their credit card.

The worst performer of the new listings was accounting software reseller Enprise Group, whose shares have dropped 18 percent to 45 cents since its regulatory listing on the NZAX this month. Utilities and airports software developer Gentrack's shares have dropped 15 percent to $2.13 since its June listing, while remote measuring tool developer ikeGPS has declined 13 percent to 86 cents.

Genesis Energy, the last of the government's partially privatised power companies, is up 19 percent to $2.145 since its April listing, while health software developer Orion Health Group was down 8.3 percent to $5.75 since its debut last month.

New Zealand has been an attractive destination for foreign investors with 2014 growth forecast at about 3.5 percent compared to 2.4 percent for the US and 2.5 percent for Australia while the central bank's official cash rate of 3.5 percent compares to zero to 0.25 percent for the Federal Reserve, zero to 0.1 percent for the Bank of Japan and 2.5 for the Reserve Bank of Australia.

""From a GDP perspective we're pretty strong and the government fiscal position is pretty robust, and it's a high-yielding market, so it's all really in favour from an international perspective,"" said James Lindsay, who helps manage $400 million in equities for Nikko Asset Management. ""That's why international investors have been lapping up New Zealand assets, both bonds and equities, because of that running yield.""

With two days left of trading, Chorus is the stand-out on the benchmark index, up 84 percent to $2.65. The telecommunications network operator recovered this year after being pummelled last year at the height of regulatory uncertainty over how much it can charge on its copper lines as it builds a nationwide fibre network.

Meridian Energy is next in line, up 69 percent this year to $1.725 after the National-led government's victory in the September general election meant removed the threat of a central power buying agency that was being promised by opposition political parties. MightyRiverPower, the first of last year's partial privatisations, rose 42 percent to $2.98.

Air New Zealand is up 65 percent to $2.58 after the airline beat profit expectations and declared a special dividend this year, and has been given a tailwind in recent months as plunging oil prices make jet fuel cheaper.

The worst performer on the benchmark index this year has been accounting software developer Xero, which is down 50 percent to $16.25. The firm has been a darling of the stock market in recent years, and peaked at $44.98 in March, but has since fallen out of favour as investors question its ability to break into the US market.

Pacific Edge is down 36 percent to 85 cents, also peaking in March before getting caught in a global sell-off of biotech and software firms.

Craigs' Lister said Pacific Edge and Xero have been strong performers in the past, and ""that's part and parcel when you're in that growth phase - you can have an exceptionally strong period and then a weak period and it all sort of events out over time.""

Kathmandu Holdings is down 39 percent this year to $2.13 after a profit warning last week sent the stock to a two-year low after a subdued start to the Christmas trading period in its Australian market.

The outdoor equipment chain isn't the only retailer to struggle this year, with children's clothing group Pumpkin Patch down 75 percent to 22 cents as it overhauls its business to remain solvent, and clothing chain Hallenstein Glasson falling 19 percent to $3.15.

Across the NZX All Index, financial software developer Finzsoft Solutions is poised to top the market with an 852 percent gain to $4 after signing its biggest deal which it expects will more than quadruple annual profit. The firm plans to pay its first dividend in four years, and is facing a takeover by managing director and majority shareholder Andrew Holliday in conjunction with Singapore-listed IT firm Silverlake Axis.

At the bottom of the index is Bathurst Resources, whose shares have plunged 85 percent to 3.2 cents after the would-be coal miner trimmed its board size and clamped down on costs while it waits for the global coking coal price to improve.

While the local stock market has had its biggest year of listings, operator NZX has also embarked on plans to roll out more exchange traded funds - a way for investors to passively track an index of securities - in the coming year, buying fund manager SuperLife for as much as $35 million.

The stock market operator also plans to introduce a new growth market, NXT, early next year, giving small and medium sized businesses the opportunity to go public without the same disclosure obligations as the main board.

Craigs' Lister said 2015 will likely be more volatile, and while the market may report another positive year, returns will probably fall back to the long term average of 6 or 7 percent.

""We're telling our clients to expect a more difficult year next year, and be a little bit more careful,"" Lister said. ""If people acknowledge those risks and realise things can't go up at a 15 or 20 percent pace forever, then at least they'll be prepared for things to be a bit tougher.""

Still, Lister said New Zealand's corporate sector is in ""really good shape"" and there should be more IPOs and opportunities in 2015 to broaden investors' choices.

47|Euro zone no longer obliged to rescue Greece, Merkel ally says|"Share Facebook Twitter Google Email



The lady endures: German Chancellor and Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Angela Merkel smiles while addressing the party convention in Cologne on December 10 (Reuters)

Euro zone politicians are not obliged to rescue Greece as the country is no longer of systemic importance to the single currency bloc, a senior member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party was quoted as saying.

Share Facebook Twitter Google Email

In an interview with Rheinische Post newspaper published on Wednesday, Michael Fuchs also said Greek politicians could not now ""blackmail"" their partners in the currency bloc.

""If Alexis Tsipras of the Greek left party Syriza thinks he can cut back the reform efforts and austerity measures, then the troika will have to cut back the credits for Greece,"" he said.

""The times where we had to rescue Greece are over. There is no potential for political blackmail anymore. Greece is no longer of systemic importance for the euro.""

The remarks are the clearest warning yet to Greek voters from a senior German politician that Athens might lose support if it flouts the terms of its 240 billion euro EU/IMF bailout after early elections next year.

Fuchs, deputy parliamentary floor leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats, has frequently expressed frustrations felt by many politicians and the German public about the pace of reform and political hold ups in twice-rescued Greece.

Polls suggest that Syriza will emerge as the strongest party in the Jan. 25 election, although its lead has narrowed. The party wants to cancel austerity and a big chunk of national debt but says it will keep Greece in the euro zone.

The head of Germany's influential Ifo economic research institute, Hans-Werner Sinn, meanwhile called a Greek exit from the euro zone an option.

""Further debt cuts will be needed again and again, unless the country is released from the euro zone and allowed to regain its competitiveness by devaluation,"" he told German daily Tagesspiegel.

On Monday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned Greece against straying from a path of economic reform, saying any new government in Athens would be held to the pledges made by the current government of premier Antonis Samaras.

48|Red-light cameras fade as speed cams get green light|"NEWARK, N.J. — Motorists rejoicing over decisions to discontinue unpopular red-light camera programs don’t have to drive too far for a buzzkill.

The number of red-light cameras nationwide is falling because of opposition from lawmakers and average Joes — but the use of cameras to catch speeders is slowly rising, potentially signaling a new battleground.

The number of U.S. communities using red-light cameras has fallen 13 percent, to 469, since the end of 2012, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit scientific and educational organization funded by the insurance industry. That includes the 24 towns in New Jersey that participated in a pilot program that ended this month with no pending legislation to revive it.

Meanwhile, the institute estimates that 137 communities use speed cameras, up from 115 at the end of 2011.

Advocates for cameras that catch red-light runners point to data showing they reduce accidents, while critics note they can’t employ judgment to distinguish between, say, a red-light run during rush hour in a school zone and a technically illegal right turn on a red light at 3 a.m. Speeding, however, is a bit more black and white when it comes to cameras.

“The goal of these advocates for the red-light cameras was a one-two punch,” said New Jersey state Sen. Michael Doherty, an opponent. “They’d come in with the red-light cameras and expand to speeding cameras.”

New Jersey’s red-light program was beset with problems: a yellow-light timing controversy that caused the cameras to be shut down temporarily; a computer glitch that voided thousands of tickets; and a federal lawsuit initiated by one resident that led to refunds for hundreds of thousands of motorists.

Traffic cameras have also been contentious in Ohio, where the governor signed a bill this month requiring a police officer to be present for traffic-camera citations, something camera proponents say negates the practicality of using them to stretch police resources.

“It makes no sense to me,” said Adam Loukx, city law director for Toledo. “It seems worse than whatever they thought they were curing.”

State Sen. Bill Seitz, of Cincinnati, who sponsored the bill, said cameras can have their benefits in areas such as school zones, but they too often have resulted in needless ticketing for harmless offenses.

“I think the cities took a kernel of a good idea and put it on steroids and managed to anger a significant amount of the population,” Seitz said.

Critics also charge that towns are more interested in revenue than improving safety. Toledo resident Joel Clark said it’s clear to him that the cameras are money makers.

“They know where to put them to make the money,” he said. “My buddy got four in a week before he knew the camera was there. That’s what, $500? That’s crazy.”

Some consider the cameras a valuable safety tool, despite missteps.

“The research is clear that photo enforcement works,” said Russ Rader, IIHS senior vice president. “It’s effective in reducing violations and in reducing crashes, both red-light cameras and speed cameras. There is no question that lives will be lost because New Jersey has decided to end the program.”

Except for parts of the Midwest, both types of cameras can be hard to avoid. A motorist could take a southwestern route from New Jersey to California and pass through only one state — Mississippi — where neither form of camera is in use.

The three states bordering New Jersey all use some form of traffic enforcement cameras, as do nearly half of all states.

In Arizona, speed cameras were used for two years on state highways before Gov. Jan Brewer banned them in 2010. Speeding and red-light cameras are still used in some municipalities after legislative attempts to ban them failed. The state also has struggled with a ticketing system that requires people who ignore mailed violations to be personally served if the case is to proceed.

Both types of cameras have been challenged in courts nationwide. The day before Ohio’s bill was signed, the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to uphold for a second time camera use by municipalities. The cameras also survived high court challenges in California and Illinois this year, and a ruling is pending in Missouri, where justices heard arguments this month on cases originating in three communities, including St. Louis.

They didn’t survive in Nassau County on New York’s Long Island, where speed cameras were installed in nearly two dozen school locations this year. The county had to forgive more than $2 million in fines due to equipment problems, and in December the county legislature voted unanimously to repeal the program."

50|Bad weather hinders search for victims in AirAsia crash|"Indonesian military load a casket containing the body of an AirAsia flight QZ8501 passenger recovered off the coast of Borneo into a vehicle at a military base in Surabaya December 31, 2014.

PANGKALAN BUN, Indonesia Rescue planes and helicopters sat grounded near the coast of the Indonesian island of Borneo on Wednesday as bad weather hampered the search for victims in the crashed AirAsia jet.

Officials were forced to suspend aerial missions as heavy rain and low visibility made it difficult to recover bodies four days after the Airbus A320-200 disappeared from the radar en route from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.

""I went to the search area this morning and saw there was no way we could do a search,"" said Dwi Putranto, a senior air force official.

""Now we are standing by in case remains can be evacuated,"" he said, adding that over 100 divers and rescue workers were ""ready to search"".

Search and rescue official Sunarbowo Sandi said bodies and debris were being scattered by strong currents and monsoon weather conditions.

""All the wreckage and bodies have drifted around 50 kilometers and we're expecting all the bodies will end up on the beaches around here,"" Sandi said.

""That is why we are searching all the beaches, because the current is moving.""

Seven bodies have been pulled from the sea so far, including one wearing a life jacket, an official said. Two of those bodies have been flown to Surabaya for identification.

The search area was narrowed to 120 square nautical miles and 22 ships continued to hunt for the remaining victims and for the plane's black box, said Putranto.

But the agonizing wait could be a long one for family members and rescue workers.

""The clouds are very low in the target area,"" Sandi said. ""Everyone is praying for more friendly weather.""

52|In 2014, racial tension over policing reached a breaking point|"It was a year of grand juries and smashed windows, of tear gas and video evidence, and of boisterous demands for police reform in Los Angeles, New York, Oakland and Ferguson, Mo., as crowds cried, ""Black lives matter.""

It was the year in which a black Staten Island, N.Y., man suspected of selling untaxed cigarettes, Eric Garner, died after an altercation with police; the officer accused of putting him in an unauthorized chokehold was not indicted. Ohio police were similarly absolved after fatally shooting John Crawford III in a Wal-Mart after he picked up a BB gun while talking on the phone with his girlfriend. Elsewhere in Ohio, a Cleveland police officer fatally shot a 12-year-old boy who was carrying a toy gun in a park, a death the state medical examiner ruled a homicide.

It was the year two police officers were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn solely because of the uniforms they wore, and of a solemn funeral afterward at which hundreds of New York Police Department officers turned their backs on the mayor of the nation's largest city, who had said he'd told his mixed-race son to be wary of the police for his own safety.

In city after city, 2014 became a year in which the nation's lingering racial fissures burst open from the strain of a fundamental disagreement over the nature and purpose of policing, especially in African American communities.

More so than teachers, tax collectors or elected officials, police officers are often the most visible representatives of the government — and its policies — on the streets of black communities across the country, which remain widely disadvantaged both economically and politically.

Eugene O'Neill, a former NYPD officer and prosecutor who is a lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, put the role of police in terms of political philosophy: ""They use force on people, they are agents of coercion, they are surrogates sent there on our behalf.""

But while the role of officers to use force to protect life and property is a universal feature of American government, polls have shown that the degree of public trust in the police is politically polarized largely by skin color and, to a somewhat lesser extent, political affiliation.

That political friction has long existed in American life, so when black activists this year likened the arrival of widespread protests to a new civil rights movement, their grievances centered on and came face to face with an old foe: the police.

The latest tumultuous chapter in America's racial history can be traced back to a few moments on Aug. 9.

That's when 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, was shot and killed by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, after a struggle and a foot chase through the predominantly black St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

Officer-involved shootings, even of unarmed victims, happen all the time, but it's unclear exactly how often, though some estimates put the number at least in the hundreds. Small protests or calls for reform afterward are common.

So why did Ferguson come to be a launching point for months of intense dissent? Some observers pointed to the predominantly black city's overwhelmingly white political leadership and police force, both of which were quickly overwhelmed by the duration and intensity of the protests that claimed its streets.

Then there was the high drama of St. Louis-area police agencies using tear gas and intimidating force in failing to quell often, but not always, peaceful demonstrations, in which every passing day seemed to bring some kind of escalation.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who ordered a state of emergency and twice called in the state National Guard, created a commission to study the roots of Ferguson's civic crisis.

Outgoing U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr., who is black, took a special interest in Ferguson, to the pique of some police unions who thought he was being too critical of ground-level law enforcement.

Federal officials descended on the suburb to open an investigation into the shooting and the practices of local police departments; the U.S. Justice Department also will continue to investigate various police departments to check for patterns of civil rights violations.

A running theme in the year's debate over policing has been understanding — or the lack of it.

Protesters in Ferguson and elsewhere repeatedly said police and the rest of officialdom do not understand the pressures, challenges and dangers facing black Americans.

""Insurance is high, gas is high, but that's not why I get mad,"" Ferguson demonstrator Ricky Jones, 34, said during one of the first nights of the uprising in August. ""At the end of the day, when I'm driving home, they ask me to pull over and get out of the car. No 'license and registration, please.' 'Get out of the car. Lay on the ground. Put your hands on your head.'""

Police, for their part, say they are misunderstood too.

""There is a very pervasive feeling in law enforcement ... that the politicians are not supporting us,"" said Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, which has 325,000 members. ""Law enforcement is the only arm of government that is ever asked to do anything about [troubled] communities. The politicians are the ones saying, 'Get in there and stop that crime.' And then, when an incident happens, they rush to judgment that police were wrong.""

The opposing accounts of what happened the day Michael Brown died seem to capture the divide that will no doubt continue as debate continues on tactics, body cameras and shooting investigations.

Some witnesses said Brown had his hands up when he was shot. Wilson told investigators Brown was charging at him to attack.

It was a basic disagreement of fact that would foreshadow the much larger debate looming for the nation — on what it means to be black in America, or to be a police officer in America, in which voices from both sides would claim to be betrayed and, most of all, deeply misunderstood.

55|Maybe raise a glass of craft beer this New Year's Eve|"In 2014 beer began to get more of the respect it deserves as a serious beverage that delivers serious flavor to those willing to dive into the sea of styles and varieties. Why not celebrate beer’s new-found respect by ringing in the new year with some malted barley beverages instead of the staid sparkling wines?

For under $30 (usually well under) you can pick up a large-format bottle of craft-brewed or imported beer that will be as at home in a festive champagne glass as any bargain-bin bubbly. Picking a bottle isn’t tough; here are suggestions for styles and bottles to share on the holiday.

The Champagne of beers

Bright, dry, and festively effervescent, these bottles of (usually) golden ale are treated to a special refermentation and conditioning process akin to what traditional Champagne goes through. The result is a refined and complex glass that will beguile those grape fans who claim to dislike beer. A classic example is DeuS from Brouwerij Bostells, while Malheur Brut Noir is a curiously dark and fruity version of the emergent style. Some American craft breweries — like Missouri's acclaimed Side Project Brewing — are beginning to experiment with the style, and perhaps by New Year’s 2016 there will be more craft brewed options for such beverages.

Belgian-style beers

If you find yourself in a liquor store stumped by what bottle of bubbly to buy for the party, take a trip to the Belgian beer aisle instead. The classic abbey-style ales have the refinement, the class, and the booze to fill the flutes of the midnight toast. Tripel Karmeliet is a perfect choice — it’s spicy and dry with a great depth of flavor and a beautiful presence in the glass. If you’re looking for something even a bit stronger (in alcohol and in flavor profile) try a dark, heavy quadrupel like the Saint Bernardus ABT12. A classic American-brewed example of the tripel is Curieux from Maine’s Allagash Brewing. Curieux starts off as a bright and peppery golden ale before getting an extended rest in used bourbon barrels, and the result is one of the most iconic brews in the craft beer world. The recently released 10th anniversary magnum bottles of the brew are a perfect bottle to pop during your celebrations.

Higher alcohol beers

One of the hallmarks of the explosion of craft breweries are the bold beers that push past the 10% alcohol mark and have the bombastic flavors to match all that booze. Imperial stouts, double (and triple) IPAs, and American-style (read: more hoppy) barleywines are all fitting libations to accompany the start of a new year. Look for the Holiday 2014 ale from Temecula’s Black Market Brewing Co. The beer is a triple black rye IPA that comes in at over 11% alcohol and will pelt your palate with pungent hop flavors and a burly malt body. Stout lovers can hoist a snifter of inky Barrel Aged Old Rasputin from North Coast Brewing or the coffee-tinged Speedway Stout from Alesmith Brewing. You know that special bottle that you’ve been saving for just the right special occasion? The New Year’s Eve party might be just the excuse you’ve been looking for to crack it open.

Sour beers

Sour beer continues to captivate drinkers, and — especially in Los Angeles — 2015 looks to be the year of sour beer. There are as many different varieties of sour brews as there are tongues to taste them, and one of the most approachable sour ales — the light and tart Berliner Weisse — was even called “the Champagne of the north” by Napoleon Bonaparte a couple of centuries ago. The more complex sour brown ales of Flanders make for more festive toasts, and the special bottles of Rodenbach Gran Cru are particularly good for a celebratory salute. The delicately fruited lambics from Brouwerij Boon or Drie Fonteinen will also fill a champagne flute with aplomb."

57|Sri Lanka stocks edge down amid selling pressure in key stock|"COLOMBO: Sri Lankan stocks fell to a one-week low on Wednesday as selling pressure in construction firm Access Engineering weighed on the index amid political concerns over a tight Jan. 8 presidential election, stockbrokers said.

The main stock index was down 0.25 percent, or 18.58 points, at 7,272.75 at 0558 GMT, its highest close on Dec. 24. Turnover was thin, at 270.1 million rupees ($2.06 million).

Shares in Access Engineering were down 1.5 percent.

""There is selling pressure on Access Engineering. The market is still waiting for some clear direction on the political front with an expected tight election,"" a stockbroker said on condition of anonymity.

Conglomerate John Keells Holdings, which helped boost turnover, was up 0.8 percent.

Analysts said defections ahead of the election have hurt sentiment.

Since President Mahinda Rajapaksa announced snap elections last month, 23 legislators including former health minister Mithripala Sirisena, who is challenging Rajapaksa's bid for a third term, have defected. Two opposition legislators have joined the ruling party.

Political parties mainly representing Sri Lanka's minority Tamils and Muslims, who account for a quarter of the total vote, have said they will back Sirisena in the poll.

In the forex market, the four-day rupee forwards, or spot-next-next, were traded at 132.10/20 per dollar at 0606 GMT compared with Tuesday's close of 132.05/132.15, dealers said.

""There is importer demand and the one-week forward was traded at 132.35/50 after banks did not trade four-day forwards below 132.10 due to moral suasion (by the central bank),"" a currency dealer said.

Rupee forwards have been pegegd at around 132.00 through the month after the central bank defended the currency through moral suasion."

59|TSMC to Make Most Apple A9 Chips, Samsung Kept as Backup: Report|"While earlier this month Samsung reportedly commenced production of Apple A9 chips, a new report now indicates the South Korean firm as the backup with TSMC being the major chip provider.

The report coming out of Taiwan states that Apple preferred TSMC to Samsung because the former can produce more chips. ""The two companies' technological capabilities are similar, so the key factor will be whose mass-production yield is better,"" said Chris Hung, Director of MIC, a consultancy, to reporters (via Taipei Times).

Hung also said that though Samsung also makes advanced 20nm chips, the company's yields are not satisfactory. ""However, as Apple tends to spread the risks, it is likely that the winning supplier of A9 [TSMC] will not take all the orders,"" he added.

TSMC was also said to have been the main supplier of A8 and A8X chips, which were used in Apple's latest iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and iPad Air 2 devices.

Couple of weeks before, Samsung was said to have started producing chips using the 14nm process, which reportedly made the A9 chips 20 percent more powerful while consuming 35 percent less battery life from the device, as per Phonearena. The report added that the production was taking place in Samsung's Austin plant. However, the firm did not confirm the speculations. ""We cannot confirm whether we received orders from Apple or at which plant it will be produced,"" said officials.

Last month, a report contrarily claimed that Samsung will produce APs for the iPhone and iPad devices from next year. It even claimed that from 2016, the company would supply 80 percent of APs used in Apple devices, while the rest would be handled by TSMC."
60|Cut out the clutter|"If a New Year comes, can wish lists be far behind? Here is one that is short and simple — cut out the clutter. There is a new government with a decisive mandate. There is renewed hope about the India story. But over the past few months, there has also been a parallel narrative. There are conflicting signals, leading even some of the most ardent supporters of the Modi government, to question whether the important has been replaced by the irrelevant, a consequence of distractions by the Sangh Parivar and its ideological affiliates. Many Modi sceptics question whether the Hindutva agenda is really a choreographed side-show as some would like to believe or the main mission?

These are fair questions given the mixed signals — the nub of the problem. As marketers never tire of pointing out, cut out the clutter. If Brand India wants to position itself as the hope, growth and development story, it has to cut out everything which distracts and threatens the main mission of achieving higher economic growth and development that is regionally and socially inclusive.

Economic growth that is sustainable and equitable requires a conducive, social and political environment. But what do we see on the ground? Over the past week, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad claims to have converted more than 60 Christians to Hinduism in Kottayam, Kerala. In Karnataka, the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha is reportedly planning a similar programme. On the other hand, in Gaya, Bihar, at least 40 Mahadalit families have reportedly embraced Chris-tianity in recent days. And Orissa police are investigating if a dozen odd tribal families in Sundargarh have been forced to convert to Christianity from Hinduism.

What does all this do to Brand India? Prime Minister Modi insists that development and good governance “are the only ways ahead”. Where does “ghar wapsi”, reconversion of non-Hindus back into the Hindu fold, fit into this vision? Is “ghar wapsi” one of India’s top priorities? Or should the nation’s energy be spent on steps that make everyone’s “ghar” strong and more liveable so that the mass religious conversions of all sorts lose their lure? Will the Prime Minister tell us what he thinks about this polarising debate?

Prime Minister Modi’s supporters say these are issues raked up by “left-liberals” who habitually critique everything that the new government says or does. But people like economist Surjit Bhalla, an ardent champion of free markets, don’t quite fit this image. In a column in a newspaper last month, Mr Bhalla exasperatedly asked, “Good god, what can we expect in January?” The reference was to the cascade of controversies over issues which have little or no bearing on the government’s professed economic and development agenda. Well, January is here and we have learnt to live with fog. But the fog in the messaging needs to go.

As we roll out the welcome mat to 2015, we need to focus on the big picture — where is India headed and where will competitive evangelism with its agonising cycle of conversions and reconversions take us? Can the economy soar if there is social and political turmoil? What are the really important discussions we need to have and what can wait? In a country where tens of thousands of schools are without basic minimum facilities and which still has a large illiterate population, is teaching of Sanskrit the immediate worry? If economic growth and inclusive development are the two key national priorities, then all issues that have no bearing on these have to be put on the back-burner.

The next step is to go beyond slogans. The National Democratic Alliance government has been quick to create attractive slogans. Slogan driven activity surrounding “achhe din”, “Ab Ki Bar, Modi sarkar”, “Make in India”, “Swachh Bharat” and now “Good Governance” have found a clear connect with large swathes of the population. But now is the time to go beyond slogans and focus on the specifics.

Take the buzz word of the day — good governance. This implies being transparent about the choices and trade-offs. What is being given up and for whose benefit? As I write, there is controversy over a cut in the health budget. Health ministry officials are speaking in different voices to the media — some saying there has been a cut, and some saying no. We need to know the truth. Especially since India has among the lowest public health expenditures in the world. Though India has marginally improved its score on infant mortality, the latest Sample Registration System (SRS) shows that one of every 25 Indian infants still die within one year of birth. It is amply clear that the government must spend more on public healthcare. If there is likely to be less money for health and right across the social sector because past allocations have not been spent, the government — both Centre and state — need to tell us why this is so and what is being done to improve capacity to use allocated resources?

Then there are socio-cultural issues which continue to be a blot on Brand India. Like the skewed sex ratio. The latest SRS shows that sex ratio at birth has improved by a point to 909 from 2010-12 to 2011-13. But what is worrying is the child sex ratio in the 0-4 age group. After being stable at 914 from 2007-09 to 2009-11, the child sex ratio (age group 0-4) for the country has decreased to 909 in 2011-2013. There are other challenges — deteriorating environment, lack of quality education, skill development. On each of these, tough choices have to be made and there needs to be a clear prioritising of what is immediate and urgent and what can wait.

Along with economic growth, these are the real issues of development. These are the litmus tests of good governance. No doubt, there will be battles ahead. But India has to choose which battles are worth fighting to usher in change. Let us hope that 2015 is the year when the change we want is visible on the ground and not just in speeches.

65|Merkel pressured over targeted killings in Afghanistan|"World Bulletin / News Desk

Opposition parties demanded an explanation from Chancellor Angela Merkel Tuesday after a German newspaper published secret documents suggesting Germany had provided intelligence for targeted killings of Taliban members in Afghanistan.

""The German armed force and foreign intelligence service BND have violated the constitution and laws by assisting in the NATO killing lists,"" Left Party lawmaker Jan van Aken told Bild newspaper Tuesday.

German weekly Der Spiegel published secret NATO documents revealing a list of around 750 suspected Taliban officials, some of whom were killed without charge or trial.

The list was prepared between 2009 and 2011 and was based on intelligence gathered by secret services of several allies, according to the weekly.

The German government had long insisted that it did not take part in any targeted killings in Afghanistan where it deployed around 5,000 soldiers since 2002 as part of NATO's mission.

On Tuesday, Bild newspaper published a secret document suggesting German secret services passed on intelligence about suspected Taliban leader Qari Yusuf to NATO units, information believed to have been used in an operation to kill him.

The secret document involved Yusuf's cell phone number, which was used to identify his location.

Hans-Christian Stroebele, a senior lawmaker and member of the opposition Green Party, harshly criticized the government and said that the parliament was not informed about these practices.

""The government must now clear the air and immediately clarify who was responsible for misinforming the parliament on this issue and for contributing to these targeted killings,"" Stroebele told German media.

The German army said in a statement on its web page that the NATO lists that involve suspected Taliban leaders and officials do exist, but denied that it was a killing list. The armed forces said the goal was to arrest those suspects.

Human right organizations have long criticized targeted killings in Afghanistan, which killed hundreds of suspected Taliban members without trial. According Der Spiegel, not only Taliban commanders were targeted, but also suspected drug dealers.

Many of these operations involved drones or helicopters and resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths, according to the weekly. In 2009 alone, around 600 civilians were killed in these operations.

Germany’s military role in Afghanistan has been a sensitive issue in domestic politics as a majority of Germans have been reluctant to see their country involved militarily in international conflicts.

German government officials, however, have advocated a more active foreign policy approach, supported by military measures, citing Germany's responsibility for ""international peace and stability.""

Germany had been one of the key contributors to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan since 2002 and has provided up to 5,350 soldiers, in the country's first international combat operation carried out by its modern, post-WWII army.

Fifty-five German soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan, 35 of them in attacks or during military operations.

The German government has decided last month to keep 850 soldiers in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of NATO’s combat troops at the end of 2014.

From Jan. 1, 2015, the NATO-led mission will focus on training and advising Afghan security forces. The 13,000 foreign troops for the Resolute Support Mission will come from 28 NATO allies and 14 other partner nations."
66|County ranks 12th statewide in alcohol sales|"WILKES-BARRE — Luzerne County ranks 12th in the state for alcohol sales, with residents guzzling more than $46 million in booze purchased at Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores during the last fiscal year, according to a sales report from the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.

The report shows county residents favored wine, spending $12.9 million on table wine in fiscal year 2013-2014 which ran from July 2013 through June 2014. Also leading the pack were vodka and whiskey, at $8.3 million and $7.5 million, respectively.

Across the region, Lackawanna County ranked 17th in the state with $38.7 million in sales, while Schuylkill County ranked 27th with $12.1 million and Wyoming County ranked 59th with $2.5 million, according to the Retail Year in Review report for 2013-2014.

But the numbers show that, per capita, Lackawanna led the pack, with $185 per person ranking the county ninth statewide. Luzerne County came in 17th statewide per capita, with $145 spent per person, while Wyoming was 41st and Schuylkill was 46th.

“The Retail Year in Review is one of the most interesting publications we produce because it shows what consumers are buying and where they’re buying it,” PLCB Chairman Joseph E. Brion said in a statement. “By tracking consumer tastes across Pennsylvania and beverage alcohol industry trends, the PLCB can continue to provide the best products at competitive prices in all 600-plus Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores.”

The report shows alcohol sales across the state topped $2 billion, with the top five counties — Allegheny, Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks and Chester — accounting for almost half of all sales last year. Allegheny was the single largest consumer in the state, with more than $271 million in wine and spirits sales.

People statewide favored spirits slightly more than wines by units sold, 50.3 percent to 49.7 percent, according to the report. The top-selling categories were vodka, bourbon, flavored vodka, spiced rum and Chardonnay.

In terms of dollars, Jack Daniel’s Black Label Whiskey generated the most sales, with $19.7 million, followed closely by a 1.75 liter bottle of Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum that pulled in $18.2 million.

But Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey was closing fast, with sales surging 231 percent from a year earlier to $12.6 million and landing the product in sixth place.

The overall biggest seller by number of units sold was Barefoot Wine, with more than 4.1 million sold, for a 27 percent increase. The next most-popular item was Jacquin’s with 3.5 million bottles sold.

By far, the month with the highest sales was December, which had about 7.2 million transactions that accounted for 12.3 percent of sales last year. That holds true for the liquor store at the Schiel’s Family Market on George Avenue, which does about two-thirds of its business in December, said Joan Newell, general manager.

Residents at that store tend toward economic choices, and are expected to be out in force today while out shopping for New Year’s Eve, she said.

“It’s busier than Christmas Eve,” Newell said. “When people get off of work — around 3:30 on — it’s going to be nuts here.”

Briana Lizza, 24, of Pittston, said she was shopping for presents at the store Tuesday afternoon. The fact that Luzerne County ranks 12th in the state was not surprising, she said.

“A lot of Italians,” Lizza said. “A lot of wine.”

67|Do buffer zones deter wars?|"Lionel Beehner (Photo: File)

The concept of the buffer zone is making a big comeback in international politics. These zones act as a Switzerland-like neutral territory or demilitarized no man's land, a kind of cordon sanitaire that avoids neighbors staring at each other eyeball to eyeball — the suburban equivalent of building a higher picket fence.

Consider the crisis in Ukraine. Russia fears that Kiev might seek NATO membership, which would effectively put it in the West's sphere of influence and give Russia less leverage over a strategic chunk of land that has historically buffered it from the rest of Europe. One of its justifications for recently seizing the Crimea and much of Ukraine's eastern half is Vladimir Putin's desire for more cushion separating Russia from NATO.

As Notre Dame's Tanisha Fazal has argued, buffer states such as Ukraine are the country's most at risk of suffering ""state death.""

""If (great powers) fail to act against the buffer,"" she writes, ""they fear that their opponent will take it over in their stead.""

Turkey-Syria overlap

Likewise, Turkey sees the violence in Syria spilling over its border. Ankara has pressed Washington to provide a buffer zone across northern Syria, akin to the one installed in northern Iraq in 1991, which stemmed the tide of refugees and buffered Turkey from the Iraqi violence against the Kurdish minorities.

Buffer zones, of course, are not new. Think back to the turn-of-the-century days of Pancho Villa, when cross-border incursions between Mexico and the United States were routine.

Historically, buffer zones range in scope. In some cases, they just entail a kind of gentlemen's agreement between neighbors to temporarily violate the other's border in ""pursuit"" of terrorists, outlaws or bandits. Iraq and Turkey struck such a deal in the late 1980s that allowed for a few-mile joint security zone into which both could march. Ditto Sudan and Uganda in the 1990s.

Yet these zones' historical record at keeping the peace is mixed.

On one hand, they can create political wiggle room to let tensions diffuse and act as a confidence-building measure. The DMZ that divides North Korea from South Korea has prevented war for more than a half-century. Buffer zones have tentatively worked to maintain the uneasy peace between Israel and Egypt and Syria over the past few decades. (Interestingly, the one place in the Middle East with no real buffer in place is within Israel itself, which is partly why violence with the Palestinians rekindles every few years.)

On the other hand, they can ""freeze"" conflicts in place, negating the need to negotiate peace. Nobody would argue the Korean Peninsula is a safe place. Moreover, to enact a no-fly zone is legally an act of war.

A Band-Aid solution

In terms of diffusing the crises in Syria and Ukraine, a buffer zone, while attractive, is at best a Band-Aid solution. If Russia gobbles up Ukraine's eastern flank, that might prevent a wider war tomorrow, but it could just postpone conflict for another day.

Similarly in Syria, a no-fly zone might ease tensions with Turkey in the short term, but that does not arrest the violence or do anything to bring President Bashar Assad to the table.

Last week, a Jordanian pilot on a mission in northern Syria to attack an Islamic State site was captured after his jet was shot down or had mechanical difficulty. The idea of wrapping states in bubble wrap merely creates the illusion of peace.

One might argue that the alternatives could be worse because they would entail providing one side -- whether the regime in Ukraine or the rebels in Syria — with a military lifeline to tip the war in its favor, all the while tiptoeing around the awkward fact that nobody will put down boots on the ground. The logic by some is to just hand Russia its share of Ukraine and give Turkey its buffer zone as a way to stem the tide of refugees and to ""contain"" the conflict.

That might sound attractive. But consider our own troubled border with Mexico. We inked a treaty way back in 1882 allowing both sides to pursue marauding bands of Native Americans across the other's border. But that did nothing to prevent the U.S. from invading Mexico during its civil war in 1916. A buffer zone is no substitute for peace or a policy of deterrence.

68|With growing terror threats, instability stares most of Asia|"With growing terror threats, instability stares most of Asia

Gurmeet Kanwal, Jan 1, 2015, DHNS:

The gruesome terrorist strike on hapless school children in Peshawar on December 16, 2014, once again underlined the dark reality that the Af-Pak region is the terror centre of Southern Asia. In fact, the region is the second most unstable region in the world and is competing closely with West Asia for the number one spot.



Both China and Pakistan have become militarily more assertive on India’s borders. Chinese transgressions into Demchok and Chumar in Ladakh cast a shadow on President Xi Jinping’s visit to India. Chinese intransigence on demarcating the Line of Actual Control continues. Quite inexplicably, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts at reaching out to the SAARC leaders, the Pakistan army under General Raheel Sharif repeatedly violated the ceasefire agreement and once again stepped up the infiltration of terrorists across the LoC.



The single greatest cause of an unstable regional security environment is the conflict in Afghanistan and the areas along the Hindukush Range astride the Durand Line. The present security situation can be characterised as a stalemate. With the drawdown of NATO-ISAF forces by year end, the situation is likely to deteriorate further.



The Afghan National Army (ANA) has assumed responsibility for security, but does not yet possess the professional standards necessary to prevail over the increasingly resurgent Taliban. The remaining US forces will ‘train, advise and assist’ the ANA. However, they are likely to continue to launch air and drone strikes in Pakistan against extremists sheltering in the Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa and FATA areas against Al Qaeda terrorists. A gradual drift into civil war appears to be the most likely outcome.



Pakistan’s half-hearted struggle against the remnants of the al Qaeda and the home grown Taliban like the TTP and the TNSM, fissiparous tendencies in Balochistan, continuing radical extremism and creeping Talibanisation in the heartland, tentative efforts towards counter-terrorism, the floundering economy and, consequently, the nation’s gradual slide towards becoming a ‘failed state’, pose a major security challenge for the region.



The Pakistan army’s campaign against the TTP in North Waziristan is floundering. The army refuses to give up its idiosyncratic notions of ‘strategic depth’ and ‘good Taliban’ and continues to sponsor terrorism in India and Afghanistan. Unless it concentrates on eliminating the scourge of terrorism, Pakistan will continue to slide deeper into chaos.



Sri Lanka’s inability to find a lasting solution to its ethnic problems despite the comprehensive defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has serious repercussions for long-term stability in the island nation. The unchecked rise of Islamist fundamentalist terrorism in Bangladesh, even as it struggles for economic upliftment to subsistence levels, could trigger new forces of destruction. Much will depend on how well the government of Sheikh Hasina cooperates with the new government in India to neutralise organisations like HuJI and the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) that operate on both sides of the border.



Nepal’s fledgling democracy is continuing to struggle. The government’s inclination to seek neutrality between India and China is a blow to the historically stable India-Nepal relationship. Simmering discontentment that is gathering momentum in Tibet and Xinjiang against China’s repressive regime has the potential to snowball into a full-blown revolt.



The people’s nascent movement for democracy in Myanmar and several long festering insurgencies may destabilise the military Junta despite its post-election confidence. Australia and most South-east Asian nations are apprehensive of the increasing Chinese presence even as US influence appears to be gradually declining. The US pivot to the Indo-Pacific is not yet seen as becoming potentially capable of balancing China.



With the newly proclaimed Caliphate astride the Iraq-Syria border that calls itself the Islamic State, turmoil in West Asia is likely to continue. Despite the efforts of the Iraqi forces, the Kurdish Peshmerga and the air strikes being launched by the US and its allies, the IS militia has been gaining ground. The Israel-Palestinian stand-off shows no sign of abating. Israel refuses to halt the construction of new settlements in the West Bank and the Hamas militia is getting increasingly restive.



Iran’s refusal to unambiguously renounce its nuclear ambitions and the vaguely stated threats of several of its neighbours to follow suit are a cause for concern in the region. Saudi Arabia is suspected to be funding Pakistan’s nuclear expansion programme as a hedging strategy against the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran.The collusive nuclear weapons-cum-missile development programme of China, North Korea and Pakistan also causes apprehension.



Security environment

The Korean military stand-off along the 38th Parallel is a destabilising factor in the precarious security environment in East Asia. This sub-region will remain volatile unless the Chinese use their influence with North Korea to persuade it to back off from the path of confrontation. Increasing Chinese assertiveness over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands and in the South China Sea is completely out of character with China’s stated objective of a peaceful rise. Other negative factors impacting regional stability include the unchecked proliferation of small arms being sustained by large-scale narcotics trafficking. India lies between the golden triangle and the golden crescent.



With a history of four conflicts in 60 years and three nuclear-armed adversaries with unresolved territorial disputes continuing to face off, Southern Asia has been described as a nuclear flashpoint. India’s standing as a regional power that has global power ambitions and aspires to a permanent seat on the UN Security Council has been seriously compromised by its inability to successfully manage the external conflicts in its neighbourhood, singly or in concert with its strategic partners.



Together, the ongoing conflicts are undermining Asia’s efforts towards socio-economic development and poverty alleviation by hampering governance and vitiating the investment climate. A cooperative security framework to unitedly meet future threats and challenges is nowhere in sight.

The suspect was then arrested after police seized two reams of Piccolo Leopard King brand, 26 pieces of butterfly, seven packs of labintador, five OG brand Triangle, two packs of five-star triangle, and 38 packs of Corsair Picollo from her store.

Charges are also set to be filed against another firecracker seller who was arrested by members of the Tugbok police on Tuesday at Brgy. Tagakpan.

Set to face charges is Elmer Bartolazo Abella, a resident of Purok Sta. Cruz in Barangay Tagakpan who was nabbed after police recovered 10 100-round Judas belt, 23 reams of Piccolo, 24 reams of OG Triangle and 165 bottle rockets locally known as kwitis.

Abella is currently detained at the Tugbok police while the recovered pyrotechnics will be used as evidence against the suspect during inquest proceedings."
71|French climate envoy sees hope in low oil prices|"This Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014, file photo shows children gathering to form an image of a tree around a sign that reads in Spanish ""The world we want"" on a beach during the Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru. Low oil prices could paradoxically help the world reach an international agreement to fight global warming, Laurence Tubiana, France's special representative for the 2015 climate conference in Paris said, laying out plans for a binding accord to stem greenhouse gas emissions. Her government will spend 11 months trying to cajole more than 190 countries into overcoming disagreements about acceptable greenhouse gas emissions and who should pay for them, and locking themselves into an accord. (AP Photo/Martin Mejia, File) Low oil prices could paradoxically help the world reach an international agreement to fight global warming, according to the French ambassador charged with organizing a key climate conference in Paris.

France is spending the next 11 months trying to cajole more than 190 countries into overcoming disagreements about acceptable greenhouse gas emissions levels and who should pay to achieve them to produce a binding accord to limit emissions.

Laurence Tubiana, France's special representative for the 2015 climate conference in Paris, says now nations can't cite high energy prices as a reason to avoid taking action.

""Several years ago, I would have said it (low oil prices) complicates things,"" she told The Associated Press in an interview this week. ""(But) lower energy prices give more maneuvering room for investment and could ultimately allow the introduction of a carbon tax or something that works like one.""

In fact, she said, forward-looking governments will be able to use the money saved on oil and gas to develop renewable technologies, rather than increasing their fossil fuel extraction. And lower costs at the pump means consumers will be less opposed to new taxes to offset greenhouse gas emissions. Those taxes, sometimes called carbon taxes, have faced resistance in the United States, but many other countries have adopted some versions of them, using the proceeds to invest in renewable resources.

Still, the argument only carries so far—many environmentalists fear that low oil prices will simply let governments continue their reliance on greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels, while high prices could force them to look elsewhere for energy.

Oil prices have plunged by half since June. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.48 to $52.64 a barrel Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The ultimate goal of U.N. climate negotiations is to stabilize greenhouse gases at a level that keeps global warming below 2 degrees C (3.6 F), compared with pre-industrial times. For Tubiana, the key to reaching that goal is a legally binding agreement, one incorporated into law or national policy in every country in the world.

Negotiations culminating in the Nov. 30-Dec. 11 meeting in Paris will rise or fall on two key points: How to divide responsibility for global warming and how to pay to fight it. The developed world used fossil fuels to build roads, cities and houses and emerging economies want to have the same chances to grow as quickly as possible. Island nations like Tuvalu and low-lying countries, meanwhile, fear rising sea levels will swamp them and need funds to adjust.

But, Tubiana said, one set of rules must apply to everyone. And ultimately, low oil prices or not, fossil fuels have to be phased out.

""We have to change the trajectory of development for all countries, rich or poor,"" she said. ""It is out of the question to pass through a phase of intensive fossil fuel use, then lowering it.""

Crucially—and potentially most difficult—she said the accord must be legally binding.

""Otherwise governments can say today they want something, then in three or four years, they can change their minds,"" she said.

That could prove complicated in the United States, where Congress voted down climate legislation in 2009. President Barack Obama has largely leaned on existing laws to make progress, raising vehicle fuel standards for trucks and proposing stricter controls on power plants but he will leave office in January 2017.

The U.S. and China, the world's two largest emitters of heat-trapping gases, negotiated secretly for months in 2014 to reach a non-binding climate change agreement but momentum from that deal disintegrated at a conference in Lima, Peru, where a compromise deal was salvaged in December to set up the Paris accord.

In Lima, China and other major developing countries opposed plans that would allow pledges to be compared against one another before the Paris meeting.

Still, Tubiana was encouraged by some progress in Lima.

""Every country has agreed to make a contribution. That is very important,"" she said.

72|Normalization For Cuba, But Nothing In Return: Krauthammer|"Charles Krauthammer

There's an old Cold War joke — pre-pantyhose — that to defeat communism we should empty our B-52 bombers of nuclear weapons and instead drop nylons over the Soviet Union. Flood the Russians with the soft consumer culture of capitalism, seduce them with contact and commerce, love-bomb them into freedom.

We did win the Cold War, but differently. We contained, constrained, squeezed and eventually exhausted the Soviets into giving up. The dissidents inside subsequently told us how much they were sustained by our support for them and our implacable pressure on their oppressors.

The logic behind President Obama's Cuba normalization, assuming there is one, is the nylon strategy. We tried 50 years of containment and that didn't bring democracy. So let's try inundating them with American goods, visitors, culture, contact, commerce.

It's not a crazy argument. But it has its weaknesses. Normalization has not advanced democracy in China or Vietnam. Indeed, it hasn't done so in Cuba.

Except for the U.S., Cuba has had normal relations with the rest of the world for decades. Tourists, trade, investment from Canada, France, Britain, Spain, everywhere. An avalanche of nylons — and not an inch of movement in Cuba toward freedom.

In fact, one could argue this influx of Western money helped preserve the dictatorship, as just about all financial transactions go through the government, which takes for itself before any trickle-down crumbs are allowed to reach the regime-indentured masses.

My view is that police-state control of every aspect of Cuban life is so thoroughly perfected that outside influences, whether confrontational or cooperative, only minimally affect the country's domestic trajectory.

So why not just lift the embargo? After all, the unassailable strategic rationale for isolating Cuba — in the Soviets' mortal global struggle with us, Cuba enlisted as a highly committed enemy beachhead 90 miles from American shores — evaporated with the collapse of the Soviet empire. A small island with no significant independent military capacities, Cuba became geopolitically irrelevant.

That's been partially reversed in the last few years as Vladimir Putin has repositioned Russia as America's leading geopolitical adversary and the Castros signed up for that coalition too.

Cuba reportedly has agreed to reopen the Soviet-era Lourdes espionage facility, a massive listening post for intercepting communications. Havana and Moscow have also discussed the use of Cuban airfields for Russia's nuclear-capable long-range bombers.

This in addition to Cuba's usual hemispheric mischief, such as training and equipping the security and repression apparatus in Venezuela."

74|Coimbatore realty mart, back with a bang|"Credai head says things are looking up for the city that will host FAIRPRO this week

An upbeat mood has been prevalent among real estate buyers in Coimbatore, particularly after Diwali and the sentiment is better compared to last year, according to Rajesh B Lund, President, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai), Coimbatore.

The association, in an effort to woo NRIs, who account for about 20 per cent of investment in real estate in Coimbatore, is organising its property show-styled FAIRPRO in the city on January 3 and 4, 2015, making it the first time it is organising two FAIRPROs in a year.

Speaking to media in Coimbatore ahead of the realty fair, he said, “Normally, the annual edition of FAIRPRO is organised during August by CREDAI, Coimbatore. But this year, it decided to hold an additional edition of the property fair at the beginning of the year in January with a view to cater to the requirements of the NRIs coming home for vacation.

Lund estimated that NRI buyers accounted for about 20 per cent of the property purchases in Coimbatore. Apart from the districts in Tamil Nadu bordering Coimbatore, people from Palakkad district in neighbouring Kerala also evinced interest in investing in real estate in the city. While conceding that the number of new project launches during 2014 were less in Coimbatore compared to the previous year, he said some of the openings could have been delayed as the promoters would have awaited all statutory approvals before launching them. But the overall status of the realty market here was better compared to many cities.

On the issue of service tax levy on new property purchases, which pushed up the overall cost of acquisition, he said that as the Government was not inclined to relax the levy, buyers were left with no choice. The developers also had to contend with frequent rise in input costs like the hike in cement prices which upset their project cost calculations and a jump in labour costs, making it difficult for them to cut prices.

Lund hoped that with the State Government promising huge investments in infrastructure development in the city, Coimbatore has potential to expand, giving a further push to real estate development here.

FAIRPRO has attracted participation by 25 member developers of CREDAI and more than 50 properties, priced from ₹20 lakh to ₹3 crore are up for sale. Banks and HFCs would also have stalls offering various financing options.

A fellow at the Penang Institute, he and his colleagues try to answer ""the 1946 question"" of nation-building and multiculturalism: can we be different and equal?

Wong Chin Huat earned his PhD from University of Essex with a thesis on electoral system and party system in the peninsula. A fellow at the Penang Institute, he and his colleagues try to answer ""the 1946 question"" of nation-building and multiculturalism: can we be different and equal?

Besides accepting our colonial past and embracing our multi-ethnic future, and delinking affirmative action from Malay-Muslim identity, the third thing we should do is reform our political system so that it can be more competitive, but less volatile.

Big Government for 'nation-building'

Big government is favoured by many Malaysians, not just the leftists who want to control and tamethe market, but even more so by many nationalists, from both the ethnic and civil strands.

Exactly because of our diverse population, a strong government is thought to be needed to hold the country together, from the communist threat during Cold War, Indonesia’s territorial ambition under Sukarno, communal conflicts and also separatism of Sabah and Sarawak.

The Sedition Act represents well the fear that “we will be in hell if the government is not reigning on us”. The act was expanded after the May 13 riot and is now to be reinforced again to further crack down on criticisms of Islam and Bornean secessionism after the abortive attempt to abolish it.

A powerful government is of course desired by ethno-nationalists and others who believe in assimilation as a tool to shape a national identity by force. For them, Malaysia should have modelled on Suharto’s Indonesia and Thailand to force assimilation on the Chinese and Indian minorities.

Thanks to the “nation-building” agenda, our federal system is more centralised than many unitary states. Financially, the Centre controls more than 90% of total governmental revenues and expenditure.

We have a powerful executive which makes both the elected lower house and appointed upper house of the Parliament its rubber-stamps, commands partisan loyalty of civil service and other state institutions, and curtails civil and political rights through draconian laws.

Judiciary independence was destroyed during Mahathir’s reign and executive power has since been gradually transferred from cabinet to Prime Minister’s Department, creating an apparatus of personal rule for whoever holds the UMNO presidency.

The inherently uncompetitive, anti-competition regime

As Lord Acton told us “power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely”, corruption and power-abuse are expected from such excessive concentration of power. But the UMNO-BN system faces a more serious problem: Malaysia has elections and the dominant coalition has not found a way to stay in power by being genuinely competitive. In fact, because of this failure, it is inherently anti-competition.

It does not only suppress opposition parties, civil society groups and opinion leaders critical of the regime, who are invariably portrayed as extremists, trouble makers, public enemies, and/or foreign agents.

Within the ruling coalition, there is not a mechanism for component parties to compete and vie for parliamentary and state constituencies based on their popularity. Allocated seats are rarely taken away from under-performing parties, for the sake of coalitional unity.

At the component party level, party members get to indirectly choose only their national leadership, but not their constituency candidates, not least because some seats are allocated to other component parties.

Hence, those candidates chosen by the national leadership often may not be the most popular ones in their constituencies, but they will still win because of BN’s powerful machinery and electoral manipulations.

The BN resolves the inter- and intra-party rivalries over legislative candidacy by simply creating more legislative seats with every round of constituency redelineation, which is simultaneously useful to exacerbate the opposition’s under-representation.

Unfortunately, the ability to maintain its dominance without having its component parties and candidates to be most competitive only costs the BN in the long run. It easily grows disconnected and susceptible to shocks.

Electoral root cause of ethnic tension

When economic crises hit in mid-1980s and late-1990s, ridden by cronyism and factionalism, and UMNO split, all hell broke loose, not only for the regime, but also for the “privileged” ethno-religiousmajority.

The heightened anxiety amongst the Malays is caused by two things: the high stake described above and also the unpredictability of electoral outcome.

The First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) is notorious for electoral volatility as a small shift in votes can result inmuch greater changes in seats.

A double-edged sword, the rampant malapportionment and gerrymandering in Malaysia amplify both BN’s victories and defeats, making electoral outcomes more volatile and unpredictable.

For example, in 2004, BN won 65.07% of votes in Selangor state election and all but 2 seats (96.43%) in the 56-member assembly. In 2008, BN’s vote share dropped to 43.80% (by 21.27% points), but its seat share plummeted to 35.71% (by 60.72% points).

In 2008, many voters just wanted to teach BN a lesson, but the lesson was so huge that the ruling coalition can be ousted with the defection of just 30 parliamentarians. While many non-Malays wereexcited to see an end to UMNO’s rule, many Malays were shocked and they regretted.

The post-2008 rise of Malay-Muslim ultra-nationalists like Perkasa and Isma is therefore a “rational” response of the insecure Malays to overcome their existential fear. (http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/opinion/wong-chin-huat/article/imagine-there-is-no-nep)

Only by making every other Malay feel under-siege, may they hope to stop the desertion of UMNO by Malays – especially of the younger generation and in urban areas who turn not only to PAS and PKR, but now even DAP.

So, be prepared for the ethno-religious tensions to continue until UMNO is ousted.

Even when that happens, continue to be prepared for the Pakatan parties’ bitter fight over seats like UMNO and MCA first did it in 1999, and identity politics will be a convenient tool to drive voters out.

Communalism won’t go away because like BN, Pakatan too does not have a mechanism to make intra-coalition competition productive.

Our political system must therefore be thoroughly reviewed. It is so highly winner-takes-all, making elections high-stake gamble, driving communal voters to see every election as a do-or-die battle for their communities.

Politics should be more competitive but less volatile.

Decentralisation

First thing first, we must decentralise governmental power, create more fields of contestation. We need to have not only more power devolved to the states, but also elected local councils and fully-elected Senates to represent the state interests.

With more power devolved from the Centre, Sabah and Sarawak should also devolve some power – for example, land, culture, language – to elected divisional government. And the divisions should have their boundaries optimally correspond to ethno-cultural boundaries of the native groups.

Nationwide, we should aim to create many third-tiered administrative divisions (cities, districts, divisions) comfortably dominated by a substantial ethnoreligious majority, so the voters have no psychological need to echo slogans like Malay Unity or Chinese Unity.

Nested within the states dominated by another ethno-religious community, these relatively mono-ethnic administrative units will have no incentives to marginalise minority groups within their jurisdictions.

Intra-ethnic division is fundamentally necessary to build inter-communal and eventually non-communal coalitions.

Proportional Representation

Secondly, electoral outcome must become more predictable and less gamble-like by being more proportional.

Specifically, I would propose the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system used in Germany and New Zealand to replace our FPTP system. Voters would have two votes, one vote for the constituency MP and the other vote for their favourite party who can list their candidates on a party list.

By deciding the parties’ seat shares on their party vote shares, this ensures highly proportional representation, completely eliminating the need for malapportionment, gerrymandering, and voter transfer.

We will likely have four to five parties if, like in Germany and New Zealand, political parties are required to win minimum 5% of party votes before being allocated any party-list seat.

These parties will likely have to form coalitions to govern, and are hence forced to be moderate. Since coalitions are more often formed only after elections, voters still have more choices than in a two-coalition system.

Parliamentary and party reforms

Thirdly, we need to empower our Parliament by transforming our parties to be “internally-made parties”, where party leadership is elected by their parliamentarians, rather than their delegates. Hence, party backbenchers can check their Party leader and his/her frontbench through party leadership election, denying the executive a powerful control of their parliamentarians.

Like in UK and Australia, there will be no room for any intervention of the head of state, or blackmailing by any “king-maker” ally.

We can further democratise the parties by letting party members choose their candidates for geographical constituencies, as well as those on party list.

From decentralisation, changing electoral system to reengineering political parties, these reforms are bold. But as Albert Einstein said, ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”

78|Amid volatility, UAE capital market regulator tightens nooseUAE|"Amid volatility, UAE capital market regulator tightens noose

Wednesday, Dec 31, 2014

Dubai: The capital markets regulator has been tightening the noose after analysts blamed the heavy slide in markets due to high leveraged positions.

On Wednesday, the regulator said it suspended four prominent traders from investing in the stock markets, without giving any reason, but widely believed to have indulged in unfair practices.

This is “to maintain the integrity of financial markets and to ensure fair trading for all investors,” the UAE’s Securities and Commodities Authority said in a statement.

The regulator has also asked stock brokers to sell off shares in the account of the trader is unable to replenish the shortfall in margin within two days, and reiterated that short selling of securities were not allowed.

The central bank board has also upped the ante by asking banks to study about margin lending by banks, which many analysts and traders believe led to the aggravated downfall in markets.

“We had a rebound in November and then the famous Opec meeting happened and oil prices started in some weakening of sentiment. But what really impacted the UAE and GCC markets was that there was a lot of leverage in the system and margin lending, which accelerated the fall,” Sachin Mohindra, portfolio manager, at Invest AD told Gulf News.

Unduly punished

“In the first nine months there was a lot of euphoria, so a lot of stocks went beyond their fair value and similarly in the recent correction, it was margin lending or leverage reduction related event, a lot of stocks were unduly punished,” said Mohindra.

One of the stocks that was punished was Emaar Properties, which lost 25 per cent of its value since December 1.

The Dubai Financial Market General Index has moved from the bull territory in late November to a bear territory. The DFM index was the second best performer in 2014 in the Gulf region.

79|US police get antiterror training in Israel on privately funded trips|"An officer aims his rifle during a protest in Ferguson, Mo. The protests have reignited concerns about the militarization of U.S. law enforcement.

The clouds of tear gas, flurries of projectiles and images of police officers outfitted in military-grade hardware in Ferguson, Missouri, have reignited concerns about the militarization of domestic law enforcement in the United States.

But there has been another, little-discussed change in the training of American police since the 9/11 attacks: At least 300 high-ranking sheriffs and police from agencies large and small – from New York and Maine to Orange County and Oakland, California – have traveled to Israel for privately funded seminars in what is described as counterterrorism techniques.

For some, dispatching American police to train in a foreign country battered by decades of war, terror attacks and strife highlights how dramatically U.S. law enforcement has changed in the 13 years since al-Qaida airplane hijackers crashed into New York’s World Trade Center. In many places, the image of the friendly cop on the beat has been replaced by intimidating, fully armed military-style troops. And Israel has played part in that transition.

As these trips to Israel became more commonplace, the militarization of U.S. law enforcement also was driven by the creation of various homeland security initiatives and billions of dollars of surplus military-grade equipment donated to local departments through the 1033 program after 9/11.

Shakeel Syed, executive director of the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California, described the tactics he sees American police use today as “a near replica” of their Israeli counterparts.

“Whether it is in Ferguson or L.A., we see a similar response all the time in the form of a disproportionate number of combat-ready police with military gear who are ready to use tear gas at short notice,” Syed said. “Whenever you find 50 people at a demonstration, there is always a SWAT team in sight or right around the corner.”

The law enforcement seminars in some ways resemble other privately funded trips to Israel, such as the birthright trips for Jewish young adults and programs for politicians, educators and other professionals. Stops on the law enforcement tours include not just the Western Wall, but also West Bank border checkpoints, military facilities and surveillance installations.

Participants speak highly of the experience. Former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Terrance W. Gainer called Israel “the Harvard of antiterrorism” after taking part in a 2005 trip sponsored by the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. Capt. Brad Virgoe of the Orange County Sheriff's Department in California called the 2013 session he took part in an “amazing experience,” recalling visits to checkpoints in Eilat at the Israeli-Egyptian border and in the West Bank near Bethlehem.

Since 2002, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee’s Project Interchange and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs have sent police chiefs, assistant chiefs and captains on fully paid trips to Israel and the Palestinian territories to observe the operations of the Israeli national police, the Israel Defense Forces, the Israeli Border Patrol and the country’s intelligence services. Tax documents from the Jewish Institute show the organization spent $36,857 on the trips in 2012.

The U.S. program began less than a year after 9/11, when the Jewish Institute brought nine American police officials to Israel to meet with Uzi Landau, Israel’s public security minister at the time. Participants represented the New York and Los Angeles police departments, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the New York and New Jersey Port Authority police and the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority police.

Recently, the seminars drew attention during the Ferguson protests because the former chief of the St. Louis County Police Department, who retired in January, had participated in a 2011 trip to Israel sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League.

Israeli security forces’ history of training police in counterinsurgency tactics predated that trip. In Mexico’s Chiapas state, Israeli military officials have been training police and military to combat the Zapatista uprising since 1994. The most recent Israeli training mission to Chiapas took place in May 2013.

Topics covered have included preventing and responding to terrorist attacks and suicide bombings, the evolution of terrorist operations and tactics, security for transit infrastructure, intelligence sharing, and balancing crime fighting and antiterrorism efforts. The training also touches on ways to use Israel’s counterinsurgency tactics to control crowds during protests and riots.

Virgoe told CIR that he and his Israeli counterparts frequently discussed protests and crowd control methods.

“Around Bethlehem, they deal with it on a daily basis,” he said. “Rock throwing, it happens all the time, and they've become very proficient at dealing with large crowds on a moment’s notice.”

Virgoe also recounted the Israeli national police’s efficiency in dealing with hundreds of thousands of Sephardic Jews who poured into Jerusalem for the funeral of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef in October.

The head of the Maine State Police, Col. Robert Williams, joined a trip sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League in early 2013. Speaking to the Bangor Daily News after his return, he noted that his Israeli counterparts had decades of experience in dealing with protests and he was impressed with their ability to suppress demonstrations.

“They call it riots and we call it civil unrest,” Williams told the newspaper.

San Diego Assistant Police Chief Walt Vasquez was on the same October 2013 trip as Virgoe and described a week of travel and training with the national police, Israel Defense Forces and intelligence officials. Vasquez also recalled “lots of discussions about crowd control” tactics. He was intrigued by a demonstration of the extensive surveillance camera network that covers Jerusalem.

Crowd control training provided by Israeli authorities to American law enforcement officials disturbs Human Rights Watch researcher Bill Van Esveld, who studies Israel and Palestine.

In Israel, “in a majority of cases, you’re seeing demonstrations that start with rock-throwing and devolve into tear gas, rubber bullets and sometimes live rounds being fired at people who are throwing stones,” he said.

Van Esveld added that his research has shown the risks for law enforcement are not as high in Israel, where he said officers and soldiers frequently disobey orders governing lethal force against demonstrators and rarely face discipline or other consequences.

“It is very rare that you get a soldier or policeman thrown in jail for killing or injuring someone – in practice, there’s a lot of looking the other way,” he said.

Israel’s use of less-lethal munitions in crowd control received international attention in 2009, when American activist Tristan Anderson was struck in the face with a high-velocity tear gas canister during a West Bank demonstration against Israel’s border wall. His skull was shattered, leaving him in a coma for months. Now, he uses a wheelchair.

Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, said the seminars reflect a militarized mindset diametrically opposed to traditional police-community relations in the United States.

“If American police and sheriffs consider they’re in occupation of neighborhoods like Ferguson and East Harlem, this training is extremely appropriate – they’re learning how to suppress a people, deny their rights and use force to hold down a subject population,” said Khalidi, a longtime critic of the Israeli occupation.

He pointed out a fundamental difference between the American and Israeli justice systems: Jewish residents fall under Israeli criminal law, but Palestinians are subject to Israel’s military justice system. Khalidi said Americans are learning paramilitary and counterinsurgency tactics from the Israeli military, border patrol and intelligence services, which enforce military law.

The most tangible evidence that the training is having an impact on American policing is that both countries are using identical equipment against demonstrators, according to a 2013 report by the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem and photographs of such equipment taken at demonstrations in Ferguson and Oakland and Anaheim, California.

Tear gas grenades, “triple chaser” gas canisters and stun grenades made by the American companies Combined Systems Inc. and Defense Technology Corp. were used in all three U.S. incidents, as well as by Israeli security forces and military units.

Footage shot by activist Jacob Crawford in Ferguson last month revealed law enforcement used a long-range acoustic device that sends out high-pitched, painful noises designed to scatter crowds. Israeli forces first used such devices in response to West Bank protests in 2005, according to the B'Tselem report.

David Friedman, the Washington, D.C., regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, organized the dozen Israel seminars hosted by his organization for law enforcement leaders. For logistical reasons, he said, participation has been limited to “the highest levels of law enforcement.” However, Friedman confirmed that the University of Wisconsin’s police department participated, and news coverage as well as news releases from his organization show other smaller agencies and campus police began participating in the mid-2000s.

Last year, the league brought American law enforcement to meet with Palestinian police in Bethlehem for the first time.

Friedman declined to reveal how much the seminars have cost his group. The main focus is on strategies and tactics, he said, but the Israeli officials are not “giving guidance or instruction on these matters.”

Friedman emphasized that counterterrorism is the focus of the seminar, though he acknowledged that crowd control does figure into the training, with Israeli officials showing footage and presentations from protests and demonstrating the equipment they use.

The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs and the American Jewish Committee did not respond to interview requests about the law enforcement training seminars they sponsor."

81|Microsoft's new 'Spartan' browser likely to be lightweight alternative to IE|"WASHINGTON -- Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, a subsidiary of The Mosaic Company, has reached around $2 billion settlements with federal and state environmental agencies to resolve charges of mismanagement of onsite waste materials at its fertilizer manufacturing facilities in Florida and Louisiana.



Announcing the settlements, which are subject to court approval, the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Thursday said Mosaic Fertilizer has committed to ensure the proper treatment, storage and disposal of an estimated 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste at six Mosaic facilities in Florida and two in Louisiana.



The settlement resolves a series of alleged violations by Mosaic of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which provides universal guidelines for how hazardous waste must be stored, handled and disposed.



The 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste addressed in this case is the largest ever covered by a federal or state RCRA settlement and will ensure that wastewater at Mosaic's facilities is properly managed and does not pose a threat to groundwater resources.



At Mosaic's eight facilities in Florida and Louisiana, hazardous waste from fertilizer production is currently stored in large piles, tanks, ditches and ponds. The piles are as high as 500 feet and cover more than 600 acres, making them some of the largest manmade waste piles in the United States.



The piles can also contain several billion gallons of highly acidic wastewater, which can threaten human health and cause severe environmental damage if it reaches groundwater or local waterways.



Under the settlement, Mosaic Fertilizer will establish a $630 million trust fund, which will be invested until it reaches full funding of $1.8 billion.



These funds will cover the future closure of four Mosaic facilitiesthe Bartow, New Wales and Riverview plants in Florida and the Uncle Sam plant in Louisianaand also be put toward the treatment of hazardous wastewater at and long-term care of those facilities and two additional facilities which are already undergoing closure.



Mosaic Fertilizer's parent company, which is one of the largest fertilizer maker, will provide financial guarantees for this work. The settlement also requires Mosaic Fertilizer to submit a $50 million letter of credit.



Mosaic has committed to spend $170 million on projects to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing and waste management programs at its facilities and $2.2 million on two local environmental projects.



Mosaic will also pay a $5 million civil penalty to the United States, $1.55 million to the State of Louisiana and $1.45 million to the State of Florida, who joined the Department of Justice and EPA as plaintiffs in this case.



""This settlement represents our most significant enforcement action in the mining and mineral processing arena, and will have a significant impact on bringing all Mosaic facilities into compliance with the law,"" said Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division in a statement.



""Moreover, through this settlement, we establish critical financial assurance to cover the enormous closure and care costs at all these facilities. This sets the standard for our continuing enforcement of RCRA in the entire phosphoric acid industry. And, it reflects our emphasis on working jointly with impacted states.""



The alleged violations in this case stem from storage and disposal of waste from the production of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, key components of fertilizers, at Mosaic's facilities in Bartow, Lithia, Mulberry and Riverview, Florida, and St. James and Uncle Sam, Louisiana.



At all these units Mosaic failed to properly treat, store, and dispose of hazardous waste, and also failed provide adequate financial assurance for closure of its facilities.



""This case is a major victory for clean water, public health and communities across Florida and Louisiana,"" said Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles for EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.



Mosaic produces phosphorus-based fertilizer that is commonly applied to corn, wheat and other crops across the country. Sulfuric acid is used to extract phosphorus from mined rock, which produces large quantities of a solid material called phosphogypsum and wastewater that contains high levels of acid.



EPA inspections revealed that Mosaic was mixing certain types of highly-corrosive substances from its fertilizer operations, which qualify as hazardous waste, with the phosphogypsum and wastewater from mineral processing, which is a violation of federal and state hazardous waste laws.



As part of EPA's National Enforcement Initiative for mining and mineral processing, the agency has required phosphate fertilizer production facilities to reduce the storage volumes of hazardous wastewaters, ensure that waste piles and ponds have environmentally-protective barriers installed and verify the structural stability of waste piles and ponds.



Mosaic has committed to spending approximately $170 million over the next several years to implement an innovative reconfiguration of their current operations and waste management systems.



Under the settlement, Mosaic will also fund a $1.2 million environmental project in Florida to mitigate and prevent certain potential environmental impacts associated with an orphaned industrial property located in Mulberry, Florida. In Louisiana, Mosaic will spend $1 million to fund studies regarding statewide water quality issues.



Commenting on the settlement, Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Mosaic Company, said, ""We are pleased to be bringing this matter to a close.""



""In the years since EPA began this enforcement initiative, Mosaic has voluntarily made a number of major improvements to and significant capital investments in our facilities to enhance environmental performance, and the settlements will build upon that good work,"" added O'Rourke."
82|Ironclad cookery|"It may be the most versatile pan around, yet it's hundreds of years old and comes in one color: the cast-iron piece de resistance. For generations of cooks, the pan has been passed along from kitchen to kitchen as an heirloom.

Among the fans of the heavy-duty pan is Ross Sveback of Afton, Minn., a lifestyle promoter and the state's answer to Martha Stewart. (""I'm the inappropriate Martha. There are no rules in my world. I don't say you can only serve this with that. You forge your own road,"" he noted in a phone interview.) When he's not on TV, or at the Mall of America doling out pointers for entertaining or everyday living, he's likely to be found in the kitchen.

Sveback himself has a cupboard full of cast-iron cookware. One of his recipes appears in the new book, ""Lodge Cast Iron Nation,"" edited by Pam Hoenig. The only company that still makes its cast-iron cookware in the United States is Lodge Manufacturing of South Pittsburg, Tenn., which opened in 1896.

Whether the cookware is used to fry chicken, bake cornbread, roast Brussels sprouts or sear steak, the pans add a special sizzle to cooking. Sveback tells us how he uses this versatile pan: on the stove, in the oven, on the grill or campfire. And at the table, where the dish can be presented direct from the heat.

Question: Why the attention to cast-iron cookware these days?

Answer: It's that old-time magic. It's the sense of heritage. People are on a budget. But they still want to buy things and treat themselves. This is one reason that cast iron is so popular. People want beautiful things in their home and they want to entertain and have a perceived elevated lifestyle. But they are going back to things that their grandmothers did -- like canning. We're in a time where people are valuing again what people do with their hands. It's a more personalized world.

Q: What are the advantages of cast iron?

A: It's approachable. Anyone who really loves cooking can afford this cookware. I can't buy a $300 copper pot, but I can get a really good cast-iron pan for $50. It's a fantastic investment in your kitchen.

Q: What cast-iron pieces do you have?

A: I have many pieces, some heritage from my grandmother, including an abelskiever pan that hangs on my wall. You can find great pieces at garage sales. Buy it, even if it's rusty, and then restore it. I have miniature cast-iron skillets that I like to use. Anytime you can serve something in individual portions, people feel special. They think you've taken extra time to do this -- but you haven't.

Q: How often do you use cast iron?

A: I cook with it almost every day, especially in the summer. I love the heat retention with the pan. I can set food out on the table in the pan and it stays warm for a long time.

Q: What are the biggest problems with cast iron?

A: People don't rinse the pan right away. Don't leave food in it or it's harder to clean. After you're done eating, remove any food from the pan, wash it with hot water and a scrub brush (not metal). Sometimes you have to be patient a bit to get it clean.

Q: How do you restore it?

A: I use a scouring pad. I scrub it with warm water to get rid of the rust. Then I add the oil. Don't use bacon grease or olive oil; use some kind of vegetable oil. I prefer canola oil. I use my fingers or a paper towel and get it all over inside the pan. You can lightly put it on the outside on the sides and liberally on the inside. Then I heat the pan on medium until it starts to smoke, take it off the heat and put it in the oven (which isn't on). I put it in there to be out of the way and because it's hot. After it cools, wipe off the excess oil and it's like a brand-new pan.

Q: What can you make in a cast-iron pan that's unexpected?

A: Pie. But line your pan with parchment (you probably don't have to, but I do). Some people make bread. I also like to make cake -- especially pineapple-upside down cake. It's the only way to get that caramelization that's so nice."

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Everything from tigers to taxes and wine to willingness is covered by new laws taking effect in the new year.



A New York law bans tiger selfies starting in February. They've been increasingly used by young men as social media profile photos. No photos with lions or other big cats either.



Wine gets a boost in the Bay State. Out-of-state wineries can ship bottles directly to consumers in Massachusetts.

California is also requiring more living space for egg-laying hens, breeding sows and veal calves.

MINSK, 31 December (BelTA) – On 1 January 2015 the base amount in Belarus will be increased from Br150,000 to Br180,000, reads Resolution No. 1255 of the Council of Ministers dated 29 December 2014, BelTA learned from the press service of the Belarusian government.This increase will allow the government to bring welfare payments pegged to the base amount in line with the actual level of prices. ""The increase in the base amount will have an impact on the size of the lump-sum payments to teaching, medical and pharmaceutical staff, workers of culture and art, specialists of agriculture and housing and utilities sectors, and workers of the cooperative consumer system who work in the areas exposed to the radioactive contamination as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,” said the Finance Ministry.Currently the base amount in Belarus is Br150,000. The last time it was increased was 1 April 2014 (Br130,000).The base amount is the economic indicator that defines the abstract value of the purchasing power of money, not associated with any specific tangible or intangible benefits. The base amount was introduced in Belarus in 2002. It is used to calculate the indicators and benchmarks in the field of labor relations, and also to determine the size of fines and fees."

91|Saraki hopeful of endless possibilities in the New Year|"Saraki hopeful of endless possibilities in the New Year

By Theo Adegoke

WorldStage Newsonline-- Chairman Senate Committee on Environment and Ecology, Senator Abubakar Bukola Saraki, 0n Wednesday urged Nigerians to look forward to endless possibilities in the New Year.

Saraki in a statement in Abuja to mark the New Year, said there was no doubt that 2014 has been a year of heightened activity in the individual, social, economic and political lives of Nigerians.

He urged Nigerians to be aware that the New Year has presented them with an unprecedented opportunity to to alter the course of the nation.

He insisted that it was time Nigerians see the 2015 elections as a turning point, and ""see ourselves as history-makers and change agents as we work to bring about a New Nigeria for all Nigerians.""

He said: ""We have witnessed our nation struggle through tough times due to our security challenges; in our homes we have struggled through the economic realities that have become so pervasive; in the media we have seen our great nation be skewered internationally for the failed policies of this current administration.

""Yet, despite all of this, my fellow Nigerians, you must know: with your help, things are about to get better.""

He added: ""As we come into 2015, we come into a year of endless possibilities. We must view the faults of the past as foregone days of lessons that we have learned from, and see the future as a chance to attain greatness.

""In this new year, we must set ourselves to the task of moving forward with the goal of creating a New Nigeria that our sons and daughters can be proud of; a Nigeria that works for the betterment of the many, as opposed to working for the greed and excesses of the few.

""We must see this new year as a new opportunity to redefine our collective bond as a nation, and work to elect leaders that will serve the people, listen to the people, and most importantly, fight for and on behalf of the people.

""As we celebrate this New Year, we must also remember our service men and women on the frontlines who fight for us; who fight to keep us all safe. We must remember our internally displaced countrymen and women, who have had to flee their homes in search of security that could not be found at home. We must also remember all those abducted by insurgents this year, and all those who are still prisoners under occupied Nigerian territories in the North East.

""As we remember all these things, we must know that at the end of the day, in this new year we have in us an unprecedented opportunity to alter the course of this nation.

""We must see the 2015 elections as a turning point, and see ourselves as history-makers and change agents as we work to bring about a New Nigeria for all Nigerians.

""As we enter 2015, I wish Nigerians all around the world a Happy New Year. I thank the Almighty for guiding and sustaining our collective journey thus far, and for keeping us ever-strong and focused as a nation of diverse ethnicities, but united hearts."""
92|Civil society causes getting more clout - Regional|"POLITICIANS in Singapore are championing more causes typically advocated by civil society activists and demonstrating their support in unusual ways.

Earlier this month, Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin and National Development Minister of State Desmond Lee both cleaned cars on a Sunday to raise funds for animal rights.

Organised by Animal Concerns Research and Education Society, the charity event raised about S$10,000 (RM26,460).

Tan also announced at the event that a community animal adoption centre is being planned, possibly at East Coast Park.

But the politician best known as a strong voice against animal cruelty is Law and Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who has rescued stray dogs and weighed in on a high-profile debate on a puppy that was put down last year.

Labour MP Yeo Guat Kwang, however, has been credited for successfully hardening the law against animal cruelty.

Yeo led a team that got Parliament to approve changes to the Animals and Birds Act last month.

It now has stiffer penalities to be imposed on offenders and more power for government bodies to enforce the law.

Within the same month, another PAP MP also successfully spearheaded a rare private member’s Bill – a would-be legislation put to Parliament by a backbencher instead of a minister.

He is Christopher de Souza, a long-time advocate against prostitution who also became the first elected MP to produce an all-new Bill against human trafficking.

The politicians’ efforts have not gone unnoticed by the civil society groups they consult.

Cat Welfare Society chief executive Joanne Ng, who cited Shanmugam’s efforts to protect animals, said: “Having a politician on board helps – by nature of his position, he garners more attention.”

The president of human rights group Maruah, Braema Mathi, said that when she discussed the Bill with de Souza, it was “clear that he really cared”.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had also remarked earlier this month on the more diverse groups that PAP activists are reaching out to in an effort to connect with the younger generation. — The Straits Times / Asia News Network"

94|UPDATE 1-U.S. easing of light crude export ban to put pressure on Asian producers|"* Most U.S. light crude expected to go to Europe, not Asia

* But ripple effect to create pressure for Asian discounts

* Asian producers already hit by falling prices, weak currencies

* Oil and LNG prices have dropped 50 pct in 2014

* Analysts expect prices to remain low well into 2015 (Adds detail on expected U.S. light crude destination)

By Henning Gloystein

SINGAPORE, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Formal U.S. government approval to ease a 40-year-old ban on exports of crude oil will squeeze Asian producers already scrambling to cut costs amid diminished revenues due to a crash in energy prices and weaker currencies.

The Obama administration on Tuesday bowed to months of pressure over the ban on exports of most domestic crude, taking steps expected to unleash a wave of ultra-light shale oil known as condensate onto global markets.

And while earlier shipments of North American condensate stalled after initial buying interest from Japan and South Korea, the addition of supplies as demand cools is likely to trigger more aggressive discounting by producers trying to defend market share in Asia, the world's biggest net oil buyer.

Traders said that most U.S. ultra-light oil supplies would end up in Europe, as a rise in freight costs has made long-distance shipments to Asia uncompetitive. Still, they said, the addition of U.S. oil supplies would ripple through the markets.

""If the U.S. can undercut West Africans in Europe, then that may force Nigeria and Angola to try and offer their supplies to Asia. And in between all that you have the Middle East suppliers offering steep discounts to everybody,"" one oil trader said.

This competition for the attention of buyers in Asia will put the region's own producers under cost pressure as revenues tumble, likely triggering project cancellations.

""Oil-exporting countries such as Malaysia may have diminished government revenues from falling energy prices and this could exacerbate their debt issues,"" said Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Singapore-based Phillip Futures.

""If prices do continue to fall and persist for a long time ... oil rig developments could be re-evaluated if the cost for extraction continues to exceed the cost per barrel,"" he said.

Malaysia's economy relies heavily on oil and natural gas sales, which have both seen prices LNG-AS halve this year, weakening the ringgit and making it hard for companies there to pay for imports valued in U.S. dollars.

Most analysts say they expect oil prices to fall further in 2015 before a rebound happens, with some forecasts going as low as $40 a barrel.

""The imbalance between supply and demand will grow in first-half 2015,"" U.S. PIRA Energy Group said this week in a report before the formal easing of the U.S. export ban.

PIRA said in a previous note that although current oil prices would mean many North American operators would not be able to cover costs, they may not shut down production but instead cut expenses.

As previously announced, Proserv was acquired by affiliates of investor Riverstone Holdings LLC, in partnership with Proserv management. Proceeds received by Weatherford were used to repay or repurchase debt.

Bernard J. Duroc-Danner, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Weatherford stated: ""We are pleased with the closing of these transactions. The divestments are another step in Weatherford's previously announced plans to monetize the company's non-core businesses. These transactions bring our total realized cash divestiture proceeds to over $1.7 billion for 2014, significantly exceeding our previously stated divestment target of $1 billion. With these proceeds, the level of debt that Weatherford carries at year end will be well below our own targets and de-risks the company substantially ahead of a cyclically challenged year in the industry.""

96|Bad weather hinders search for AirAsia Flight QZ8501; 7 bodies recovered|"SURABAYA, Indonesia — Indonesian searchers battling bad weather in their efforts to find more remains from AirAsia Flight QZ8501 have so far recovered seven bodies from the sea, officials said.

A day after the first bits of debris from the commercial jet were spotted afloat off the coast of Borneo, the search operation was hampered Wednesday by big waves, strong winds and heavy rain.

And answers about why the aircraft, with 162 people on board, fell from the sky Sunday remained elusive.

Seven bodies — four men and three women — have been recovered from the water so far, said Indonesia’s national search and rescue chief, Bambang Soelistyo. One of the women found was wearing a flight attendant’s uniform, he said.

“Reality of seeing the evacuees and some of my aircraft parts are soul destroying,” AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted.

Sonar may have detected wreckage

There was conflicting information about whether any parts of the plane had been located underwater.

One search official told CNN that he believes sonar equipment has detected wreckage from the plane at the bottom of the sea but couldn’t confirm it.

“I think that that’s the case,” said Hernanto, the head of search and rescue for Surabaya, the Indonesian city where Flight 8501 began its journey on Sunday.

But the national search and rescue chief was more cautious.

“Until now, we haven’t found the plane,” Soelistyo said, according to Indonesia’s national news agency Antara.

Search teams are looking for other bodies and parts of the plane, including its so-called black boxes. Those could help investigators determine what went wrong on the flight, which lost contact with air traffic controllers after the pilot asked to change course and move to a higher altitude because of bad weather.

Bodies returned to city of departure

The difficult weather conditions were making it harder to get all the bodies that have been recovered back to land.

Two of the corpses arrived at a hospital in Surabaya on Wednesday afternoon after being airlifted from a city nearer the search site.

Somber preparations have been made in Surabaya to receive and identify the human remains in the coming hours and days.

Dozens of ambulances were lined up. On the grounds of a police hospital stood several refrigerated shipping containers where bodies will be stored while awaiting examination. Nearby, tents were pitched with gurneys on hand.

Debris and some bodies were found Tuesday 100-200 kilometers (60-120 miles) from the aircraft’s last known location over the Java Sea, Indonesia’s search and rescue agency said.

The news came as a devastating blow for family members of passengers, who had been waiting anxiously for information about their loved ones for days.

The suffering was made worse for some of them, who saw live television pictures of a corpse in the water.

Families still want and expect regular and full updates from authorities, Suyone Thejakusuma, who said he had relatives and friends on the flight, told CNN on Wednesday. A new information center for families was being set up Wednesday next to a police station in Surabaya.

International search effort

Several nations are contributing resources to the effort, including the United States, Singapore and Malaysia. The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Sampson is already supporting the search and recovery operations.

The USS Fort Worth is also being prepared to deploy from Singapore, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. It “can be ready to sail in a day or two to get on station and can be there very quickly,” he said.

The United States is also preparing maritime patrol aircraft that could help, he said.

The flight, which was lost Sunday on its way to Singapore, was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members. The overwhelming majority were Indonesians. There were also citizens of Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea.

Flight 8501 was operated by AirAsia’s Indonesian affiliate."

98|2 men arrested in England on suspicion of 'terrorism-related offences'|"Pakistan Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq has admitted that he is considering calling time on his international career after the upcoming three-match series against England in the United Arab Emirates.



The 41-year-old veteran batsman said that the series against England could be his last, but added that he hasn't made up his mind fully on taking retirement, the Express Tribune reported.



Misbah had earlier expressed that he wanted to retire at the end of this year after playing his last series against India. However, the escalating tension between the two nations along the border has put the proposed series in jeopardy.



He also insisted that he wanted to make his last innings a memorable one with an outstanding performance.



Commenting on the series against the Alastair Cook-led side, Misbah warned his teammates against getting over-confident and said that they would have to work very hard and play at their full potential to win series against a much-improved England side.



Pakistan will aim to maintain their winning streak this month in the UAE, where they had beaten England 3-0 in 2012. (ANI)"

100|Push to relax US oil export ban ends 2014 with breakthrough - Business News|"WASHINGTON: The U.S. ban on exporting most domestic crude oil became one of the defining energy policy issues of 2014, as months of heavy lobbying concluded with the Obama administration opening the door to shipments of certain ultra-light oil.About one year after the Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz first raised the four-decade-old ban as an item for discussion, the Department of Commerce on Dec. 30 took steps toward allowing export of the oil. It approved some of more than 20 pending requests to export processed ultra-light oil and issued the clearest definitions yet of what companies may export.The action, which follows months of growing pressure from energy companies and lawmakers, is expected to lead to a wave of exports of the ultra-light oil, also known as condensate. But it will not be enough to reduce a glut of shale oil expected along the U.S. Gulf Coast in coming years that energy interests say will eventually choke the drilling boom.Congress passed the export ban after the 1970s Arab oil embargo led to snaking lines at gas stations and fears of a global energy shortage. Only Congress can fully lift the ban, a action not expected to happen soon. But the administration could take steps next year to relax it.Here are some key events over the last 13 months in the push to relax the ban:December (2013) - Moniz tells a Platts conference in New York the domestic drilling boom means it may be time to review the export ban as energy issues deserve ""some new analysis and examination in the context of what is now an energy world that is no longer like the 1970s.""January - Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, kicks off a year of lobbying against the ban, urging President Barack Obama to lift it and issuing a report saying an end to the ban would create jobs and keep oil output growing at record levels.February - Research group Resources for the Future issues a report concluding gasoline prices would fall 2 to 7 cents per gallon if exports were allowed. It is the first report in a string of studies, fully or partially supported by the energy industry, that reached similar conclusions.March - A Reuters/IPSOS poll finds 71 percent of Americans oppose crude oil exports if they raise the price of gasoline, up from 67 percent in November 2013.March - Four independent U.S. refiners including PBF Energy Inc and Alon USA Energy Inc launch the first major lobbying effort to oppose lifting the export ban, which has benefited them by keeping domestic crude cheap.March - The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, the arm of the Department of Commerce that oversees export regulations, privately issues so-called commodity classification notices, or CCATs, to Pioneer Natural Resources Co and Enterprise Products Partners LP. The rulings, which did not become publicly known until months later, give permission under existing law for the companies to export processed condensate.May - John Podesta, an adviser to President Barack Obama, says the administration is taking an ""active look at what the production looks like, particularly in the Eagle Ford in Texas,"" and whether refiners could absorb that oil, at a conference at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.May - Reuters reports that oil companies including Pioneer held talks with the Department of Commerce and were hopeful that the Obama administration would allow some exports of condensate.June - Pioneer and Enterprise publicly confirm that the Commerce Department had given them CCATs in the spring to export condensate processed in a distillation tower.July - The first condensate cargo for export loads in Texas. Westport Petroleum Inc, a U.S. based arm of Japanese trader Mitsui & Co, chartered the BW Zambesi, with a capacity of 76,000 dead weigh tons.July - Reuters reports the Commerce Department has put an indefinite hold on requests for permission to export processed condensate, stalling an industry push to ship a glut of oil from the drilling boom. The hold would not be lifted until late December.September - Reuters reports that foreign trade partners Mexico, South Korea, and the EU put pressure on Washington to ease the crude export ban.September - The oil tanker Polar Discovery, loaded with Alaskan crude - which is exempt from the export ban - sets sail for South Korea, the first such shipment in more than a decade.November - Reuters reports that the first commodity classification notice to export processed condensate had actually been granted to Peaker Energy in 2013. The small firm was not believed to have exported any oil.November - BHP Billiton Ltd [BHP.AX] strikes a deal to sell a cargo of processed U.S. condensate without having first received a formal ruling from the Commerce Department, becoming the first company to ""self-classify"" the oil and thus test the limits of the ban.

December - The Department of Commerce breaks months of silence and takes two steps to open up processed condensate exports: it begins approving ""some"" of the pending CCAT requests to export processed condensate; and it issues the first formal guidelines and definitions for what constitutes exportable crude oil, including clarifying the degree of distillation required. - Reuetrs"

102|Expect some big scientific breakthroughs in 2015|"Washington: While 2014 saw some marvellous discoveries like 3D-printed body parts and scientific breakthroughs like comet landing, 2015 too holds a great future for science, reports the prestigious journal Nature.

The first big news is expected to come with the reboot of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in March after a two-year shutdown.

The machine at CERN, Europe's particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, will restart with collisions at 13 trillion electronvolts - almost double the current record.

Scientists hope that the extra firepower will help the collider to unearth phenomena that fill in gaps in the standard model of particle physics.

The US and China, the world's biggest carbon emitters, made historic pledges in 2014 to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions.

""That could clear the way for a new global climate deal at United Nations talks in Paris in December where nations hope to finalise a legally binding post-2020 agreement,"" the report added.

Another important discovery can be to stop the Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

That will require wider use of proven public-health measures - such as rapid detection and isolation of people with Ebola.

Trials of vaccines are planned for early in the year; results should come by June.

""Tests are already under way on several drugs, as are trials of treatments that use the antibody-rich blood of people who have survived Ebola. The blood treatments could be rolled out quickly and widely if proved effective,"" the Nature report read.

In March, NASA's Dawn probe will arrive at protoplanet Ceres, the most massive body in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

Ceres is thought to have water ice beneath its crust.

And after travelling five billion km, NASA's New Horizons craft will finally reach Pluto, making its closest approach July 14.

The encounter promises the first intimate look at that rocky world and its moons, and new data on Pluto's atmosphere.

Drug companies are racing to bring a new class of cholesterol drug to market, and some may cross the finish line this year.

The therapies, which reduce levels of low-density lipo-protein (LDL) cholesterol by targeting the protein PCSK9, have shown promise in clinical trials.

Palaeogeneticists hope to sequence the complete genome from the 400,000-year-old Sima de Los Huesos human, found in a deep cave in northern Spain.

Germany also gets a new research vessel, which shares its name with its predecessor: Sonne. Elsewhere on the seas, the Ocean Observatories Initiative, a US push to monitor the seas in real time, will be completed in late May.

Japan is also likely to restart ""scientific"" whaling in Antarctic waters after a hiatus imposed by the International Court of Justice.

103|Bennet seeks to ban energy exploration near Glenwood Springs|"DENVER (AP) — Sen. Michael Bennet's office on Tuesday said the Democrat will reintroduce a bill to limit energy exploration in an area south of Glenwood Springs.

Bennet will reintroduce the Thompson Divide Withdrawal and Protection Act in the wake of a new White River National Forest Service document that already prohibits drilling in the area roughly bounded by the Crystal, McClure Pass and Glenwood Springs. But the forest plan can be changed in a subsequent administration, while the Bennet bill would permanently prohibit future leasing federal land in the region for energy exploration.

Many local groups argue the area's future is in outdoor tourism rather than energy extraction. But some Republicans want energy companies to be compensated for leases they hold that they would not be able to use. Bennet's bill would allow existing leaseholders to sell out their interests to conservation or other groups.

""Our goal is to facilitate a long-term solution to protect the divide and provide certainty to the surrounding communities,"" Bennet spokesman Adam Bozzi said."

Those apart, six have died in Mali, one in the United States and eight in Nigeria, which was declared Ebola-free in October.



Spain and Senegal, which have both been declared free of Ebola, had one case each, but no deaths.



Sierra Leone, which has overtaken Liberia as the country with the most infections, counted 9,446 cases and 2,758 deaths on December 28.

105|Teen, juveniles charged with breaking into Cranston homes, stealing car|"CRANSTON, R.I. (WPRI) — A Providence teenager and three juveniles were apprehended Tuesday after police said they caught them breaking into a two-family home in Cranston.

An alert citizen contacted Cranston police at about 11:30 a.m. for suspicious activity at 17 Calvin Street. Officers responded the home to find the rear-entry door was open, a window was broken and the suspects were still inside.

Police said they began to surround the home when the four males burst out of the rear door. All four suspects were captured by police following a foot chase through several yards.

Investigators said a vehicle stolen in Providence was recovered near the scene, and is believed to have been the planned getaway vehicle. Several items taken from the homes were seized from the possession of the suspects, according to police.

Alejandro Ovalles, 19, of Eddy Street, was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle, 2 counts of breaking and entering, 3 counts of conspiracy, and 3 counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The three juveniles, also from Providence, were charged with breaking and entering, possession of a stolen motor vehicle, and conspiracy.

“I commend these officers for their swift response and apprehension of all of the suspects who attempted to flee the scene of a crime on foot. I want to also thank the observant citizen, whom quickly alerted the Cranston Police Department of suspicious activity,” said Col. Michael Winquist in a statement. “The combined efforts of the Cranston Police Department and an alert citizen led to yesterday’s arrests and will likely prevent the victimization of other home owners in the City of Cranston.”

Ovalles was arraigned in court Wednesday and released on personal recognizance. The juveniles were taken to the Rhode Island Training School pending a hearing in Family Court."

107|Gun retailers talk safety in wake of mother’s accidental shooting death in Idaho|"× Gun retailers talk safety in wake of mother’s accidental shooting death in Idaho

SEATTLE — Local gun retailers say accidental shootings, like the one at an Idaho Walmart on Tuesday, could be prevented if gun owners took the proper safety measures.

Mike Coombs, of Outdoor Emporium, doesn’t just sell guns, he also uses them. He’s very careful about having them around his children.

“I own a lot of firearms, but they’re all locked up. And I teach my kids and family members that every firearm should be treated it as if it’s loaded.”

He tries to teach his customers as well. He gives them free cable trigger locks when they purchase a gun.

“You can either put it through the cylinder or through the barrel,” says Mike Albert. “I like using the barrel, because then nothing’s going through it.”

For about $10, gun owners can get a combination trigger lock. Coombs says something like that could have prevented a tragedy like the one in Idaho.

He understands people who want to take advantage of their right to carry a concealed weapon, but says gun owners have to take extra precautions.

“I don’t know what the law reads, but I think it (the firearm) has to be on your body or in your control,” he says. “If it’s somewhere else, it’s not going to be in your control. You have to be smart with it and keep it in a safe, locked position with kids and other people.”

He’s partnered with both King County and Seattle Children’s Hospital, taking part in lock box giveaways and spreading the word about responsible gun ownership.

“There’s really no excuse for anyone to have a firearm and not have it locked up.”

Coombs says he will offer a discount on certain safes and locks to Q13 Fox News viewers, if they mention this story."

110|Foreign Policy Battles Loom Between Obama, Republican-led Congress|"Foreign Policy Battles Loom Between Obama, Republican-led Congress

VoA - News Wednesday 31st December, 2014

WASHINGTON - Some of President Barack Obama's loudest critics on foreign policy will have new powers as chairmen of various Senate committees when Republicans assume control of both houses of Congress in January.

From Ukraine to the Middle East, the Obama administration can expect enhanced scrutiny of its outreach to the world

As global conflicts rage, from Ukraine to the Middle East, Republicans are quick to fault the Obama administration on its outreach to the world.

Earlier this year, Republican Senator Bob Corker said, ""I have no earthly idea how the administration plans to go about degrading and destroying ISIS in Syria. I have no earthly idea.""

Republican Senator John McCain is equally critical, saying, ""This president does not understand [Russian President] Vladimir Putin. He does not understand his ambitions, that Vladimir Putin is an old KGB colonel bent on restoration of the Russian Empire.""

Come January, Corker will be chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; McCain will head the Senate Armed Services Committee.

""John McCain rarely pulls punches. He is quite sure of what needs to be done, and that the president is not doing it,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst.

Rothenberg said a Republican-led Congress can affect Obama's foreign policy -- up to a point.

""They can limit what the president can do not only on domestic spending, but spending internationally -- national security, armed forces and things like that. Having said that, this is the one area where the president traditionally has considerable freedom to operate,"" he said.

Obama will remain commander-in-chief for two more years. But Republican-led congressional committees will shine a spotlight on his performance, said University of Chicago political scientist William Howell.

""Politically, they have powerful incentives to underscore what they perceive to be the failings of the Obama administration in foreign policy. They can set the terms of the discussion that is going to ensue. They can have investigations,"" Howell said.

McCain gave a taste of such scrutiny in a heated exchange with Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Elissa Slotkin on the administration's policy concerning Islamic State militants.

""I'm asking what the strategy is,"" McCain said.

""Our strategy is to defeat ISIL,"" Slotkin said, using an acronym for the Islamist group.

McCain stopped her, saying, ""That's a goal, not a strategy. I want to know what the strategy is.""

In reality, Obama is not immune to criticism from lawmakers of his own Democratic Party.

Senator Robert Menendez is skeptical about nuclear negotiations with Iran.

""Right now, we are playing right into the Iranian narrative,"" Menendez said at a hearing earlier this month.

Foreign policy battles could erupt as soon as Congress reconvenes in January. For example, Corker said lawmakers are eager to tighten sanctions against Iran if nuclear negotiations fail."
111|Can't We All Just Get Along? Maine Political Leaders Share New Year's Resolutions|"After a fairly tumultuous election cycle, more than a few political leaders and their advisors are looking ahead to 2015 as a chance to do things just a little differently. Candidates and activists have their own unique New Year's resolutions.

A.J. Higgins reports on the New Year's resolutions of Maine political leaders and activists.

Following a lot of active campaigning to become Maine's independent governor, no one could blame Eliot Cutler if he simply wanted to take all of 2015 off. But the Cape Elizabeth lawyer says he plans to find ways to remain engaged with public policy.

""I'm going to try to do the very best I can for my family and the state of Maine,"" Cutler says. ""The most important resolution I have is not to run for governor again. But otherwise I love this state very, very much. And I'm going to try and find ways in which I can make a contribution outside the realm of elective politics.""

Gov. Paul LePage, who cruised to victory over Cutler and Democrat Mike Michaud with 48 percent of the vote, hopes things can be a little more harmonious around the State House next year.

""My resolution for the new year? Get along with the Legislature,"" LePage says.

As the last of what is rapidly becoming a vanishing breed of Republicans, Sen. Susan Collins says her moderate inclinations will be put to the test in 2015 as she attempts to collaborate with varying factions within the new GOP majority in the U.S. Senate.

""My most ambitious New Year's resolution is to find an issue that Elizabeth Warren, Ted Cruz and I can agree on and work together on - that's my most ambitious resolution for the new year, given the ideological span represented by Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz, and I'm in the middle,"" Collins says.

The resolution from Maine's junior senator, independent Angus King, involves a pilgrimage that most New Englanders can relate to. ""My New Year's resolution - if the Pats make it - is to go to my first Superbowl,"" King says.

Closer to home, at the State House, Republicans sounded as though they were still on the campaign trail when asked about their thoughts for next year. Only two years ago, Lisbon Falls state Sen. Garrett Mason secured a victory in a recount by a scant 28 votes. But he and other Republicans rode a wave of popular support last month to reclaim the majority this year. Now Mason is the Senate majority leader, and he kept his resolutions close to the party line.

""My New Year's resolution is to follow through on the promises that we made during the campaign: reducing energy costs and making sure that the very scarce funds for welfare services go to those who truly need it,"" Mason says.

At the opposite end of the State House, Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves sounded a conciliatory tone after Democrats lost seats during the November election, but were still able to hang on to the majority.

""So my New Year's resolution is to make sure that we're taking every opportunity to create more jobs here in Maine, and we know that we're going work with our Republican colleagues and Gov. LePage with that,"" Eves says. ""And I think that, if we're successful, we'll see the jobs gap closing that currently exists in Maine.""

Members of Maine's political culture are not limited to those holding political office. Brent Littlefield, a Washington consultant who guided the successful campaigns of both Gov. LePage and incoming 2nd District Congressman Bruce Poliquin, says he wants to get more sleep in 2015.

Mike Tipping, the communications director for the progressive Maine's People's Alliance wants a better life for his sons.

""One thing I've been thinking about is that this is my boys' first holiday and first New Year's - I had twin boys this year - and I worry a lot about how short-sighted our politics can be sometimes,"" Tipping says. ""And so I guess the resolution I'd like is that I'd like to see more investment in the future in Maine - things like education and environmental protection and welcoming new Mainers. And I don't think we've seen as much of that as we might have liked last year, and, hopefully, it gets better.""

Here at MPBN's State House Bureau, we resolve to continue striving for the kind of balanced coverage that our listeners have come to expect from us."

113|Abbas announces plan to join ICC, could set stage for filing war crimes cases against Israel|"Share Facebook Twitter Google Email



Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, centre, meets cabinet members of its unity government (AP)

Mahmoud Abbas has said the Palestinians will join the International Criminal Court - a move that sets the stage for filing a war crimes case against Israel.

Share Facebook Twitter Google Email

Go To

The Palestinian president made the announcement in the West Bank, a day after the UN Security Council failed to pass a resolution that had aimed to set a deadline for Israel to end its occupation of territories sought by the Palestinians.

Mr Abbas had warned that if the resolution failed, he would resume a Palestinian campaign to join international organisations to put pressure on Israel.

His decision is expected to trigger a harsh response from Israel.

Israel says all disputes should be resolved through peace talks, and such actions are aimed at bypassing negotiations.

The resolution vote was a blow to an Arab campaign to get the UN's most powerful body to take action to achieve an independent state of Palestine.

The US, Israel's closest ally, had made clear its opposition to the draft resolution, insisting on a negotiated peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, not an imposed timetable.

It would have used its veto if necessary, but did not have to because the resolution failed to get the minimum nine ""yes"" votes required for adoption by the 15-member council.

The resolution received eight ""yes"" votes, two ""no"" votes - one from the US and the other from Australia - and five abstentions.

""We voted against this resolution not because we are comfortable with the status quo. We voted against it because ... peace must come from hard compromises that occur at the negotiating table,"" US Ambassador Samantha Power said.

She criticised the decision to bring the draft resolution to a vote as a ""staged confrontation that will not bring the parties closer"".

And she added that the resolution was ""deeply unbalanced"" and did not take into account Israel's security concerns.

Until shortly before the vote, council diplomats had expected the resolution to get nine ""yes"" votes.

But Nigeria, which was believed to support the resolution, abstained. Its ambassador, U Joy Ogwu, echoed the US position saying the ultimate path to peace lies ""in a negotiated solution"".

The Palestinians could point to support from two European nations, France and Luxembourg, reflecting the growing impatience especially in Europe over the lack of progress in achieving a two-state solution, and the increasing pressure on governments to do something to end the decades-old conflict.

This impatience, and frustration over the Security Council's paralysis in dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was echoed by many on the council, including the US.

Jordan's UN Ambassador Dina Kawar, the Arab representative on the council, said after the vote: ""The fact that this draft resolution was not adopted will not at all prevent us from proceeding to push the international community, specifically the United Nations, towards an effective involvement to achieving a resolution to this conflict.""

Before the vote, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians can return again to the Security Council, which will have five new members starting tomorrow who are viewed as more sympathetic to their cause.

Israel's image and its standing, especially in Europe, have come under increasing pressure as a result of this summer's Gaza war and its refusal to halt settlement building.

Mr Abbas found himself under pressure at home to proceed with a UN vote and to take other measures after months of unrest with Israel.

Pressure increased earlier this month after a Palestinian minister died from a heart attack after scuffling with Israeli security forces in the West Bank at a protest against settlements.

That incident came after months of tensions that included the collapse of the latest round of US-backed peace talks, a 50-day war between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, Israeli security measures that restricted Muslim access to a revered holy site in Jerusalem and a spate of Palestinian attacks that killed 11 people.

The violence seems to have mostly subsided in recent weeks but attacks persist.

The Italian Coast Guard rescued 970 migrants on Wednesday after smugglers put their cargo ship on automatic pilot heading straight for a crash into the Italian coast and abandoned command.

The Coast Guard officials said the migrants, most believed to be Syrians and including many children and pregnant women, arrived safely in Gallipoli, in Italy’s southeastern Puglia region, before dawn Wednesday. More than 100 migrants were treated for hypothermia. The heavily pregnant woman’s waters broke during the drama,.

“It was a race against time,” said Coast Guard Cmdr. Filippo Marini. “The ship was only a few [nautical] miles away from the coast of Puglia” on Tuesday night when six Coast Guard officials were lowered by helicopter onto the bridge of the Moldovan-flagged Blue Sky M to try to correct the ship’s course.

The coastguard was already working flat out because of the Norman Atlantic ferry fire when it scrambled two helicopters.

Cmdr. Marini said the smugglers apparently had left the engine blocked on automatic pilot at a speed of 6 knots (nearly 11 kmph) into the coast.

“There would have been death and destruction” if the vessel had crashed into the coast, he added.

Storm



Because a storm was churning up the Adriatic Sea, rescuers couldn’t board the ship from nearby Coast Guard vessels. But once on board they unblocked the engine and steered the vessel safely into Gallipoli’s harbour, Cmdr. Marini said.

The Coast Guard traced the ship’s location after a passenger made a satellite phone call seeking help. It was not clear what port the ship had left from.

To avoid capture, smugglers frequently abandon migrants at sea, sometimes overturning the passengers’ unseaworthy boats, according to survivors.

Experienced



Italy’s coastguard has vast experience in rescuing boat people fleeing conflict or poverty in the West Asia, Africa and Asia. More than 170,000 have landed in Italy this year and hundreds, possibly thousands, more have perished at sea while attempting the crossing. This year alone, well over 100,000 migrants were rescued at sea by Italy.

Asked how the smugglers could flee given the stormy seas, Cmdr. Marini said the migrants were being interviewed to see if the smugglers might be mingled among them."

118|NRM party is incapable of upholding constitutionalism|"Letters

From 1987 to 1995, the country was run on an undocumented no party Movement system whereby everyone was presumed to belong to the Movement. In 1990, NRM negated its promise to return the country to pluralism after four years in power.

The 1995 Constitution was received with relief as it marked a return to constitutional rule despite the severe restrictions it carried. The no party movement system was entrenched as a movement political system and was deemed to operate until Ugandans, through a referendum, chose a different political system.

This was to be the case till 2005 when multi-parties were allowed.

However, the parties were allowed after term limits were erased from the Constitution. At the same time, the no-party Movement political system was turned into a party!

According to Article 71(d) of our Constitution ‘members of the national organs of a political party shall be regularly elected from citizens of Uganda….’. Article 72 (2) states ‘An organisation shall not operate as a political party or organisation unless it conforms to the principles laid down in this Constitution.’

However, the recent changes in the NRM constitution have made some party positions non-elective.

The no-party Movement turning into a party plus the recent changes in the party Constitution clearly shows NRM as incapable of upholding constitutional rule in Uganda."

Some manage modest growth,others see decline

NPL eats into private banks' coffers

Siddique Islam



The un-audited operating profits of the country's private commercial banks (PCBs) got into a mixed bag in the just-concluded calendar year, primarily due to the swelling of non-performing loans (NPL).



Bankers attributed the fall in operating profits of some larger banks to the rise in their NPLs, as a portion of the even rescheduled loans again turned classified for borrowers' inabilities to repay the same.



Besides, the sluggish trend in the country's capital market alongside the private-sector credit growth and different loan scams led to the lower level of profits of the banks in 2014, according to the bankers.



A good number of PCBs were able to record only a modest rate of growth in their operating profits in 2014 over the previous calendar year.



But the growth rates of operating profits of some other PCBs in 2014 were lower than those in 2013, they added.



The volume of classified loans increased 11.58 per cent to Tk 572.91 billion in the July-September period of the year from Tk 513.44 billion in the previous quarter. It was Tk 481.72 billion in the first quarter in 2014.



The central bank started persuasion of the banks from the first week of December to reduce the volume of classified loans by the yearend through intensifying recovery drives across the country.







""Some banks have been able to increase the amount of operating profits following the rescheduling of their good number of loans during the last week of December 2014,"" a senior official of a leading private commercial bank (PCB) told the FE.



He also said some loans had been rescheduled in line with the central bank advice.



It is gathered that some banks do have the intention to increase their operating profits with a big difference in comparison with the previous months of the year by adopting some unethical practices, according to an insider.



In spite of a strong supervision by Bangladesh Bank, the banks are still doing this.



As such, the real operating profits of the banks have not been reflected, the source added. The Bangladesh Bank (BB) is now working to formulate a special policy on restructuring large loans.



The first meeting of the six-member committee was held at the central bank Wednesday.



""We're working on the issue,"" a BB senior official told the FE.



He wouldn't elaborate.



Talking to the FE, anther BB official said the central bank will look into any unethical practice and 'window-dressing'.



Operating profits, however, do not indicate the real financial health of a bank. Because, the banks have to make room for provisioning against bad loans and taxes that have to be paid to government from such profits.



The operating profits of banks and non-banking financial institutions are a major source of income taxes collected from business entities by the National Board of Revenue (NBR).



As such, the aggregate position of operating profits of PCBs has an impact -- favourable or otherwise -- on revenue collection, in the form of direct taxes, collected by the NBR, depending upon the level of such profits.



The FE could collect figures of operating profits of 22 banks, out of a total of 39, including nine new PCBs, until its going to the press Wednesday.



Of those banks, the Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd. (IBBL) was the top operating-profit earner in 2014. Its earnings rose to Tk 17.25 billion in 2014 from Tk 16 billion a year ago.



The United Commercial Bank Ltd was placed in the second position with an estimated earning of Tk 8.85 billion in operating profit -- up from Tk 7.10 billion in 2013.



The Southeast Bank Ltd stood third with an estimated earning of Tk 8.33 billion in operating profit, compared to that of Tk 6.70 billion in 2013.



The operating profit of the Prime Bank Ltd. dropped to Tk 7.10 billion in 2014 from Tk 8.32 billion in the previous year while Pubali Bank's operating profit came down to Tk 7.67 billion from Tk 8.15 billion.



Al-Arafah Islami Bank made an operating profit worth Tk 6.45 billion in 2014 against Tk 4.57 billion of the previous year while Mutual Trust Bank earned Tk 2.80 billion, up from Tk 2.11 billion in 2013.



The operating profits of EXIM Bank rose to Tk 6.25 billion in 2014 from Tk 5.25 billion and the Social Islami Bank Ltd (SIBL) to Tk 4.70 billion from Tk 3.25 billion.



The IFIC Bank rose to Tk 4.08 billion from Tk 4.03 billion and Mercantile Bank to Tk 4.50 billion from Tk 4.30 billion.



The operating profit of the National Credit and Commerce Bank Ltd (NCCBL) came down to Tk 3.86 billion in 2014 from Tk 4.05 billion in the previous year while Shahjalal Islami Bank's operating profit dropped to Tk 2.50 billion from Tk 2.80billion.



The First Security Bank Ltd posted an operating profit worth Tk 2.11 billion in 2014 compared to Tk 2.0 billion in 2013.



Dhaka Bank rose to Tk 4.75 billion from Tk 4.56 billion and the Premier Bank to Tk 2.65 billion from Tk 1.52 billion.



Bank Asia made an operating profit worth Tk 6.02 billion in 2014 against Tk 5.48 billion of the previous year while Jamuna Bank earned Tk 3.45 billion, up from Tk 3.21 billion in 2013.



The Modhumoti Bank Ltd posted an operating profit worth Tk 510 million in 2014 to Tk 120 million in 2013 while Union Bank's rose to Tk 420 million from Tk 250 million.



The NRB Commercial Bank's profit rose to Tk 390 million from Tk 110 million and South Bangla Agriculture Bank to Tk 310 million from Tk 140 million.

120|NY court upholds outdoor smoking ban at parks|"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A ban on outdoor smoking in New York parks was upheld Wednesday by a midlevel court, reversing a judge and dismissing a challenge filed by a smokers’ rights group.

The Appellate Division, ruling unanimously, said the ban was consistent with the mission of the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation - “to allow all patrons to enjoy the fresh air and natural beauty of its outdoor facilities.”

The five justices concluded the agency didn’t usurp the Legislature’s authority with regulations that banned smoking at state parks in New York City and at designated areas at other parks around the state. The panel acknowledged there’s no specific legislative directive to restrict park smoking outdoors.

They noted the Legislature has prohibited smoking at indoor public spaces and expressed “its determination that tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke, is hazardous to one’s health.”

“Furthermore, the record does not indicate that the designation of no smoking areas continues to be the subject of great public debate,” Justice Karen Peters wrote. “In fact, 91 percent of the comments that respondents received on this rule were favorable and many commenters expressed their desire that smoking be banned outright in all state parks.”

The rules established no-smoking areas in February 2013 at various parks statewide, including popular beaches and all nine state parks within New York City. The city has a separate outdoor smoking ban for its parks and beaches, which had City Council backing and wasn’t challenged in this lawsuit.

Judge George Ceresia ruled last fall that state parks officials exceeded their authority, ordering they stop enforcing the outdoor ban and take down the signs. He noted that the Legislature had previously considered but failed to enact an outdoor ban.

The parks office said Wednesday’s “decisive” court ruling upheld a common-sense policy to let visitors enjoy the outdoors without being bothered by secondhand smoke and keeping parks healthy places for families. It has posted online its list of no-smoking areas.

Edward Paltzik, attorney for NYC Citizens Lobbying Against Smoker Harassment, said he’s disappointed Ceresia’s ruling was overturned and will encourage his client to appeal. He had called the previous ruling “a vindication of individual rights in the face of government overreach.”

He said the court “minimized the importance” of lawmakers’ repeated failure to pass legislation and overlooked the park agency’s rule that would allow it to ban smoking entirely, though it only applies now to about 5 percent of state parkland.

123|Honda releases a teaser video for the HR-V crossover|"To be launched in early 2015.

Honda has released a teaser video for its Honda HR-V crossover, which will launch in Indonesia in early 2015. Launched as Vezel in Japan last year, the HR-V is based on the same platform as the India-bound Jazz hatchback.

[Can’t see the video above? Head to YouTube.]

After being presented in markets like China (as the Vezel and the XR-V), Thailand, and Japan (as the Vezel) etc., the HR-V is destined to be launched in Indonesia, positioned against similarly sized vehicles like the Ford EcoSport and Nissan Juke. The vehicle was earlier confirmed for local production in the country, making it only the second destination in the world to manufacture the car. Honda’s Mexican plant (in Celaya) will also produce the US-spec version next year.

Engine options for the HR-V will include a 1.5-litre petrol engine and a larger 1.8-litre unit. The 1.5-litre engine makes a maximum of power of 118 hp at 6,600 rpm of power and maximum torque of 145 Nm at 4,600 rpm. It will be available in four three trim levels, namely A, S, and E, and can be chosen with either a manual transmission or a CVT automatic. The larger 1.8-litre engine that makes 138 hp at 6,500 rpm and 169 Nm at 4,300 rpm, will only be available in ‘Prestige’ trim, and with a CVT gearbox.

The HR-V was first showcased in Indonesia at the Indonesia International Motor Show in September 2014, in standard, Modulo and Mugen variants. It’s 4,295 mm long, boasts a wheelbase of 2,610 mm, has a ground clearance of 185 mm and gets safety features like dual front airbags, ABS, EBD, ESP, electric parking brake, and hill start assist.

Juacelo Nunes, 39, is lucky to be alive after the 30cm-long blade passed through his mouth, into the right side of his jaw, narrowly missing his left eye.

The motorcycle taxi driver also suffered knife wounds to his chest, throat and shoulder after an argument at an event in Agua Branca, Brazil.

Three other men are though to have been involved in the attack.

He remained conscious throughout the whole ordeal and drove over 60 miles to a hospital in Teresina - although he says he cannot remember the point at which he was stabbed.

Miracle: Juacelo Nunes is recovering in hospital after the ordeal

""I did not see the moment of the stabbing, but at no time fainted and remained conscious even with pain,"" he told G1 news website.

""I thought I would die and only came to believe when I saw what happened to me, because if someone told me I would not have believed it.""

The director of the hospital in northeastern Piaui state said: ""The knife passed through several nerves and veins, structures that can quickly kill a patient.""

Nunes' wife said she was shocked when she saw him with the knife in his skull and described his survival as a ""miracle"".

He is currently recovering in hospital and is in a 'surprisingly' good condition.

126|Health commish: ‘If you’re sick, stay home’ on New Year’s Eve|"Revelers may want to ring in the New Year with a distant wave rather than a hug or kiss. The flu is here.

“If you are sick, stay at home,” Dr. Gale Burstein, Erie County commissioner of health, said Tuesday. “Sorry, you’re not going to have a fun New Year. But if you’re not feeling well, it won’t be fun anyway.”

County health officials are reporting a surge in the number of confirmed influenza cases. The number of positive tests for influenza more than doubled in one week, increasing 127 percent, according to county Health Department surveillance data. They’re much higher now than at this point in either of the previous two flu seasons.

“We’re seeing very high levels of influenza in our community right now, but it’s really reflective of what we’re seeing across the country,” Burstein said.

New York is one of 36 states reporting geographically widespread flu, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. State health officials characterized influenza as widespread, with laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus in 49 counties and New York City.

There were 2,066 laboratory-confirmed influenza reports statewide during the week ending Dec. 20, a 154 percent increase over the previous week, the state Health Department reported.

In addition, the number of patients admitted to hospitals with laboratory-confirmed influenza or hospitalized patients newly diagnosed with the flu was 392, a 61 percent increase over the same period.

But doctors say flu sufferers not experiencing a life-threatening complication such as difficulty breathing or severe dehydration should consider calling their primary care physician or visiting an urgent care center first, before seeking treatment at a hospital emergency department.

Most flu cases can be managed at home with over-the-counter medications, plenty of fluids and rest, said Dr. David Pierce, chief medical officer for Millard Fillmore Suburban and DeGraff Memorial Hospitals

“We’re seeing a high influx of people that are sick with other illnesses and flu,” he said. “So what’s happening is people are waiting for an extended period of time in the emergency department. If you don’t need to be there and you have to go through a four, five or six hour wait just to get a diagnostic test when you really don’t need treatment, it’s a long time to wait.”

To prevent the spread of the flu, Burstein recommends frequent hand washing, coughing into your arm rather than hands and getting a flu vaccine.

“It’s still important to get immunized with the influenza vaccine if you have not already been immunized,” she said.

This year’s flu vaccine was produced based on predictions for what strains of influenza would be most prevalent, Pierce said.

“This year there’s some holes in it. There’s some gaps,” said Pierce. “So we’re seeing a lot of strains of influenza that the vaccine did not cover and that might be why we’re seeing a higher surge this year as opposed to the past several years.”

The majority of flu cases so far this year involve Influenza Type A, which “is not a deadly strain of influenza, it’s not an epidemic strain of influenza like swine flu. It’s general influenza,” Pierce said.

Groups at risk of developing severe complications from influenza include children under 2 and people over 65; those with chronic respiratory diseases; pregnant and postpartum women; and people with compromised immune systems.

Burstein said patients who fall within one of those groups should contact their health care provider as soon as symptoms surface to inquire about a prescription for an influenza antiviral medication such as Tamiflu or Relenza, an inhaled therapy approved for people 7 years old and older.

“Those are both in good supply and they’re both good antiviral flu medications,” Burstein said, noting they’re effective only if they are administered within the first 48 hours of the onset of illness.

With students returning to school Monday, health officials expect cases of the flu to continue to rise.

Flu is spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk, health officials said. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby.

“It’s a good time to start talking to your kids about staying away from other children attending school who might be ill and washing their hands as much as possible,” Burstein said.

It would require the company to sell through a wholesaler - typically costing more than 30% of all sales.

An amendment to the law has been proposed

ut time is running out.

If Governor Deval Patrick doesn't sign off on the change before the new year, production at Homestead will effectively stop. And eventually, it could mean the closure of the business.

""5 years from now it would probably help us because we would be able to focus more on production, get more product out, and allow the wholesalers to do that, but where it stands right now, it's just not in our cards,"" said Schmitt.

128|Putin sends New Year’s greetings to Obama|"Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a New Year message to US President Barack Obama about the two countries sharing mutual responsibility to ensure world peace. – Reuters pic, December 31, 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin today sent a New Year's greeting to US counterpart Barack Obama, saying the two countries share mutual responsibility to ensure world peace.

In a statement showing Putin's New Year's messages to heads of state across the world, the Russian leader addressed Obama despite the crisis in US-Russian relations over Ukraine, saying the ""Russian-American partnership could have been developing successfully.""

Putin said the coming year will mark 70 years since the end of World War II when countries united against Adolf Hitler.

""This historic date is a reminder of the responsibilities of Russia and the US for supporting peace and international stability, their unique role in countering global challenges and threats,"" the statement said.

Obama in recent interviews has said that while many believed Putin fooled the world with his quick Crimea annexation, he is in fact looking weak now that the Russian economy is suffering the consequences of sanctions.

""I'd sense that at least outside of Russia, maybe some people are thinking what Putin did wasn't so smart,"" Obama told US radio NPR this week.

The list of Putin's greetings spans from Abkhazia – a breakaway region of Georgia that Moscow recognises as independent – to Japan.

Putin also sent regards to several individuals no longer in office, including Silvio Berlusconi, George Bush and Nicolas Sarkozy.

Moscow's relations with most Western countries, particularly former Cold War adversary the United States, have plunged to a post-Soviet low as the West accuses the Kremlin of sending troops into Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have been fighting with Kiev's forces since April. – AFP, December 31, 2014."
129|Number of newborn babies in Japan fell to record low in 2014|"Japan’s population likely dropped further in 2014, with the estimated number of newborn babies in the country falling to 1,001,000, down about 29,000 from the previous year, according to health ministry estimates released on Wednesday.

The estimated number of people who died in 2014 totaled 1,269,000, an increase of around 1,000. As a result, the natural population decline, calculated by deducting the number of deaths from that of births, came to a record 268,000.

The latest data have an anticipated margin of error of 1,000, meaning that the number of newborn babies may slide below 1 million when new statistics on Japan’s population are released in June.

An official at the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said a further drop in the number of children is inevitable as “the number of reproductive-age women is on the decline.”

The number of newborn babies, which hit more than 2 million annually in the 1970s, dropped below 1.5 million in 1984 and below 1.1 million in 2005, the health ministry data showed.

On the other hand, the number of deaths topped 1 million for the 12th consecutive year. The top four leading causes of death in the country were cancer, heart disease, pneumonia and cerebrovascular disease.

The number of couples that got married in 2014 came to 649,000, down about 12,000 from 2013, while divorced couples numbered 222,000, down around 9,000.

132|Cures for the New Year’s hangover|"Russians chug a glass of brine from a jar of pickled gherkins. In Mexico, beef tripe soup will set you straight. Strong coffee with a shot of condensed milk and a raw goose egg is the popular pick-me-up in Bali.

Some people are willing to do anything to get rid of the raging hangover and all the painful side effects — the fireworks exploding in your head, dizziness, acidic throat and back-flipping stomach — that come after a night of drunken revelry. But we all know there is no medically proven cure-all aside from the obvious: not drinking.

If abstaining from alcohol this New Year’s Eve is out of the question, here are some other ideas:

Drink water: Alcohol is a diuretic, and excessive drinking can cause dehydration. Replacing the fluids lost could help you feel a little less miserable.

Eat before you drink: Food helps slow the body’s absorption of alcohol.

Beware of pain killers: Aspirin and other pain killers could irritate an already sensitive stomach. If you need pain relief, try the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) kind, like ibuprofen or naproxen. Acetaminophen and alcohol is a bad combination for the kidneys.

Eat light the morning after: Alcohol metabolism mostly takes place in the liver, which also produces glucose. Alcohol can interfere with the production of glucose, which can cause low blood sugar. Eat basic carbohydrates like bread and crackers to offset the symptoms associated with low blood sugar, like dizziness, blurry vision and headache.

135|Lacrosse tournament draws thousands to Wesley Chapel|"The NDP Lacrosse Dicks Sporting Goods Tournament of Champions is heating up in Pasco County.

Thousands of people from all over the United States and Canada made the trip to see who will take home the win.

Rain didn’t dampen the crowd Tuesday that came from all over to watch boys ages 9 to 18 compete in lacrosse. The tournament is taking place at the Wesley Chapel District Park on Boyette Road and at Wesley Chapel High School.



“We came after Christmas and fought the traffic down here,"" said Diane Horner, who traveled from Charlotte, North Carolina, to see the tournament. ""It was pretty brutal.""

Over the years thousands of people have made coming to Pasco County for the international tournament a tradition, like John Clerkin from Ontario.

“Great time, great spirit, great camaraderie,” said Clerkin.

He says it’s also a good excuse to escape the cold.

“After being such a cold winter up there last year everybody’s coming down,"" he said.

Close to 100 teams were in Wesley Chapel to compete, with a total of nearly 10,000 people showing up for the event. Economic studies show those visitors are likely to pump over $3 million into the Bay area economy.

“The tournament is three days,"" said Josh Gross, VP of National Development Program. ""A lot of teams stay for four, five, six, days. We’ve had teams stay for as long as two weeks,”

The tournament has been held in Pasco County since it started seven years ago. Quincy Abhram from Ontario has been playing here the last four years and says there’s only one down side for him.

“It’s hot here,” said Abhram.

However, it hasn’t stopped him from considering coming back for good.

“I want to come here for university,"" he said. ""I’ve heard they have a pretty good lacrosse team.”

Enthusiasts of the sport say they are excited that it has continued to grow across the country and plan on competing year after year.

The tournament has grown each year. It started with 25 teams in 2008. It now has close to 100.

Pasco County says its contract with the tournament ends next year. It says it hopes to negotiate a new contract to remain the host for years to come.

Malta

A tractor-trailer jackknifed during a blinding snow squall Wednesday, dumping about 75 gallons of diesel fuel onto the Northway, which was already the scene of several accidents, State Police said.

Troopers said that at about 12:25 p.m., the truck driver failed to observe that traffic was stopped because of the wrecks caused by the snow.

The rig, driven by Ernest J. Daust of Franklin County, then careened into a guardrail in the median and forced authorities to shut down all three northbound lanes filled with holiday eve motorists. Emergency crews and the state Department of Environmental Conservation responded to mop up the spill, which took several minutes, police said.

More Information

Most of the accidents were fender-benders amid the white-out conditions between exits 11 and 12 in Saratoga County.

Despite the mess, there were no reported injuries, added State Police.

The southbound side of the Northway remained open, said Trooper Mark Cepiel, a State Police spokesman.

Brian Frugis, a National Weather Service spokesman, said weather radars showed ""quick-hitting snowstorms"" that hit parts of Saratoga County. ""It definitely looked stronger than a typical snowstorm,"" he said.

As a result, the weather service issued a special weather statement and then called to alert the state Department of Transportation of the impending snow squalls that Frugis estimated began around noon and lasted for about an hour.

During that time, Frugis said the snow fell at a heavy clip for about 15 minutes, where it was ""coming down heavy enough to reduce visibility significantly"" between northern parts of Clifton Park toward Saratoga Springs. On the Northway, the affected area extended roughly from exits 10 to 13.

Frugis likened the hit-or-miss nature of the snow squalls to thunderstorms in the summer that may affect one area and not another one only a few miles away in what he described as a ""highly localized event.""

There are no squalls in the forecast for the next few days, but the high for New Year's Day will be below freezing at 28 degrees, Frugis said.

138|Newspaper Covering the Caribbean|"Fracture

Director : Gregory Hoblit

Screenplay : Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers (story by Daniel Pyne)

MPAA Rating : R

Year of Release : 2007

Stars : Anthony Hopkins (Ted Crawford), Ryan Gosling (Willy Beachum), David Strathairn (Joe Lobruto), Rosamund Pike (Nikki Gardner), Embeth Davidtz (Jennifer Crawford), Billy Burke (Rob Nunally), Cliff Curtis (Detective Flores), Fiona Shaw (Judge Robinson), Bob Gunton (Judge Gardner), Josh Stamberg (Norman Foster)

In Fracture, there is no question about who did it--or, at least, it doesn’t seem that way. In fact, it appears that director Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear) shows us right up front exactly what happens, why, and how. Wealthy and brilliant aeronautical engineer Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) spies on his adulterous wife (Embeth Davidtz) and her lover (Billy Burke) at a hotel, then goes home, waits for her, calmly confronts her about it, and then shoots her point-blank in the head. The police arrive, Ted is arrested, and he confesses to the murder. Case closed.

The seemingly open-and-shut nature of the case is the primary reason that Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling, fresh off his Oscar nomination for Half-Nelson), a cocksure young attorney in the district attorney’s office who, as he puts it, doesn’t “like to lose,” takes it as his last case before gliding on his slick 97% conviction rate straight into a cushy corporate lawyer gig. He doesn’t really want the case, but he sees it as an easy last win, and Ted does everything but call him “chicken” to goad him into it. Why? Well, that’s part of the slippery nature of Fracture, a thriller that pretends to present you with everything while slowly revealing that it has shown you virtually nothing.

Willy’s case starts to come apart when the forensics team is unable to produce the murder weapon. They have a gun from Ted’s house (one of those cavernous, ultra-modern tombs that visually suggests inordinate wealth and soullessness), but tests reveal that it’s never even been fired. Willy is positive that the actual weapon is there because Ted never left the house between the time of the murder and the arrival of the police, but multiple searches fail to discover it. The whereabouts of the gun become the lynchpin of the case, which slyly illustrates how courtroom drama has virtually nothing to do with truth or fiction, but merely what someone can prove. Willy knows that Ted did it--he’s sure of it--but because he can’t prove it, it doesn’t matter. He is also not helped by the fact that the arresting officer was Ted’s wife lover, who conveniently hides his less-savory involvement in the case from Willy until it comes up on the stand.

As a twisty-turny thriller, Fracture has its moments. Like the structures Ted builds for his own amusement, Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers’s screenplay is an elaborate contraption of misdirection, although it works primarily if you don’t figure out the truth about the murder weapon. However, even if you get that one figured out before the big revelation (which comes, in standard movie fashion, from the villain himself), Fracture still holds quite a few surprises and takes some unexpected paths, especially the one that finds Willy, our supposed hero, not only defeated, but truly failed. Fracture is a brave thriller in its willingness to take the components of a well-worn genre and use them to explore the fragile nature of movie heroes--how all that cocky self-assuredness that defines so many Hollywood icons can be used to mask the deepest of flaws. In any other movie, Gosling’s swagger and ambition would be celebrated, but here it literally costs someone a life.

The real pleasure in Fracture, though, is watching Hopkins and Gosling, the elder statesman and brash young firebrand of the current cinema’s greatest actors, go at it. There are obvious echoes of The Silence of the Lambs (1991), with Hopkins once again playing a brilliant sociopath while Gosling’s upstart, ladder-climbing lawyer steps in for Jodie Foster’s upstart, ladder-climbing FBI agent (both use of whom use barely masked Southern accents to mark their ascent out of the lower classes through professional success). Yet, the two actors are so fierce in their convictions and so thoroughly calculated in their ambitions that they transcend the film’s moments of courtroom cliché and make them hum with a high-wire tension.

Moscow has advised Washington and Brussels to drop their attempts to pressure the Russian judicial system or to politicize individual criminal cases in regard to the latest sentence brought against anti-Kremlin blogger Alexei Navalny, a Russian Foreign Ministry human rights ombudsman said Wednesday.



""In regard to the 'concerns' expressed by several representatives from the United States and the European Union over the sentencing of the Navalny brothers found guilty of embezzlement, I would like to recommend that Washington and Brussels leave their attempts to pressure the Russian judicial system behind and not to politicize a clearly criminal case,"" Konstantin Dolgov said in a statement posted on the Foreign Ministry's website.



On Tuesday, US State Department spokesperson Jeff Rathke called the verdict against the Navalny brothers a ""disturbing development"" and said that it was designed ""to punish and deter political activism"" in Russia.



Earlier in the day, a Moscow court handed down a suspended sentence of 3.5 years to Alexei Navalny in a case involving alleged embezzlement from the Yves Rocher cosmetics company. Navalny's brother, Oleg was sentenced to a real prison term of 3.5 years.



The prosecution initially requested 10 years imprisonment for Alexei and eight for Oleg, who was also fined 500,000 rubles ($9,000). The brothers were fined an additional 4.4 million rubles ($77,500) in a civil case involving the Multifunctional Processing Company."

An intriguing tale of the insatiable curiosity, unending dedication and numerous sacrifices that lead to the discovery of what is now commonly known as X-rays



It is the late eighteen hundreds and a young Polish woman wishing to study at the Sorbonne has just arrived in Paris. She had no money but she made up for it in spirit. Maria Skowdowska would, despite her poor knowledge of the local French language and the hardship of living on a fund that she had saved painstakingly for almost a decade, graduate with degrees in physics and mathematics, in 1893 and 1894 respectively. Here she met a professor by the name of Pierre Curie, a Frenchman who cared for knowledge more than recognition. Just like Maria. Pierre had discovered a curious phenomenon. Certain crystals when squeezed generate electricity!

At that time, a discovery such as this would have been considered an esoteric curiosity. Maria started working on another such apparently esoteric but mysterious phenomena. She had heard that ores of uranium emitted a certain kind of ray called radioactivity, first studied by the Frenchman Henri Becquerel. Soon, Maria found other ores that had even higher radioactivity for a given amount of sample. Interestingly, nothing she did to destroy the emissions worked and from this she drew the conclusion that radioactivity was a fundamental property of the atom, the ""indivisible"" particle of matter. Her discovery of ores that had even higher emissions of rays per unit weight, she concluded, must mean that ores contained hitherto undiscovered radioactive elements. So exciting were Maria's discoveries and conclusions that Pierre left his work on piezoelectricity and together, after a period of inspired hard work, they revolutionized our understanding of radioactivity ushering in wide variety of advances in science and medical technology. So intense was Pierre's commitment to his work, he did a demonstration at a lecture in London where he bandaged a purified sample of the newly discovered element Radium to show that it would burn through human tissue, which at the time was a ground-breaking idea that led to treatments for cancer amongst other things.

These discoveries were so exciting that they began an era of research in radiation. In 1895, a German physicist Wilhelm Rontgen discovered that photographic plates kept next to Crookes tube, a vacuum tube through which electricity was made to flow, would get exposed or fogged. He concluded that there were unknown rays that must be doing the job. These rays are the now familiar X-rays used ubiquitously for medical diagnoses all around the world. Their discovery came from the pursuit of curiosity and of trying understand natural phenomena without resorting to the temptation of attributing them to supernatural causes.

X-rays turned out to have the interesting property of passing through soft tissue like flesh easily but not so much with harder materials like bone and less so with metal. But the rays had so much energy that at least a little would pass through almost anything.



Imagine the analogy to light. We can see things that are on the other side of a glass partition well when the glass is clear but the image dims if the glass were coloured (or grayed) and passing less light than a clear one. But as long as some light goes through the glass, you will able to see what is on the other side. Stretch these ideas a little and you will realize that since X-rays go through ""opaque"" object you should be able to see inside them. These methods have been perfected today to the point that passing X-rays through human bodies and imaging what gets out on the other side by placing a large sheet of photographic film allows doctors to see inside the body in great detail without doing any surgery.

Invisible rays, a topic that attracted the finest minds in physics have found yet another unexpected application in a field apparently unrelated to science. Great masters of the European renaissance left behind masterworks that weren't always preserved in the best possible manner. As a result many masterpieces were not only damaged and degraded but, even worse, were subjected to restoration attempts from later generations of painters who were, shall we just say, not as masterly. It turns out that certain paints contained more lead than others. Lead is dense and, to an incoming beam of X-rays, it will show up differently in the images like bones show up differently from flesh in a medical X-ray. This realization led conservationists to X-ray masterpieces to determine how to re-restore them best.

To their great surprise, they found mysterious figures hidden under layers of paint that pointed to an older interpretation, by the masters, which had been painted over by someone much later. From science to art and back, invisible rays have illuminated more about human history than their visible cousins. May they continue to do so in the coming year.

148|Kim Jong-un says North Korea is open to 'highest-level' talks with South|"Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video.Please install Adobe Flash ™ and try again. Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un on Thursday proposed the “highest-level” talks with South Korea, opening the way to a historic summit as his communist country battles to fend off UN prosecution over its human rights record.

The sudden move, made during Kim’s traditional New Year message, would clear the path for the first inter-Korean leaders’ meeting since a 2007 summit in Pyongyang.

“Depending on the mood and circumstances to be created, we have no reason not to hold the highest-level talks,” Kim said in the televised speech, calling for a thaw in icy relations between the two Koreas, which remain technically at war.

Seoul welcomed the overture as “meaningful”, coming after the North’s state media had previously used sexist and personal language in attacks on South Korea’s first female president, Park Geun-Hye.

Park has repeatedly said the door to dialogue with Pyongyang is open, but insists the North must first take tangible steps towards abandoning its nuclear weapons programme.

“Our government hopes South and North Korea will hold dialogue without further ado in the near future,” Ryoo Kihl-Jae, the South’s unification minister in charge of inter-Korean affairs, told a briefing.

Any talks should feature “practical and frank discussions on all issues of mutual concern”, he said.

Kim also urged Washington to take a “bold shift” in its policy towards Pyongyang and denounced the United States for leading an international campaign over the North’s dismal human rights record.

“The US and its followers are holding on to a nasty ‘human rights’ racket, as their schemes to destroy our self-defensive nuclear deterrent and stifle our republic by force become unrealisable,” he said.

He described nuclear weapons as the guardian of his country and vowed to sternly retaliate against “any provocations” threatening its dignity.

Pyongyang faces growing pressure over its rights record, with the UN stepping up a campaign to refer the North’s leaders to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.

The isolated nation, meanwhile, experienced an internet outage last month after Washington vowed retaliation over a crippling cyber attack blamed on North Korea against Sony, the studio behind a controversial film about a fictional plot to assassinate Kim.

A US State Department official said after Kim’s speech: “We support improved inter-Korean relations.”

Kim said in his message that Pyongyang “will make every effort to advance dialogue and negotiations”, adding that the “tragic” division of the Korean peninsula should not be tolerated.

The leader’s tone was generally conciliatory, but he made it clear that South Korea should end its periodic joint military exercises with the United States.

“Needless to say, faithful dialogue is not possible in such a brutal atmosphere that war exercises targeting the other side are going on,” Kim said.

The last round of high-level negotiations was held in February and resulted in the North hosting a rare union of relatives separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.

The two Koreas agreed to restart dialogue when a top-ranking North Korean delegation made a surprise visit to the Asian Games held in the South in October.

The trip raised hopes of a thaw in relations, but was followed by minor military clashes along the border that renewed tensions and talks never materialised.



Analysts said Kim was extending an olive branch after realising that Pyongyang could not end its isolation without first improving ties with Seoul.

“North Korea opted for a practical line after facing up to reality, because it is now difficult to improve ties with the United States and other countries,” Yoo Ho-Yeol, a Korea University professor, said.

Kim’s New Year message, which sets the direction of policy for the coming year, also focused on improving living standards in North Korea, which suffers chronic food shortages.

His father and late leader Kim Jong-Il, who died in December 2011, left a country in dire economic straits, the result of a “military first” policy that fed ambitious missile and nuclear programmes at the expense of a malnourished population.

Kim also used his message to urge North Koreans to work harder in strengthening the country’s military capabilities through the development of “powerful advanced” weapons.

Under the younger Kim’s leadership, North Korea has placed a satellite in orbit and conducted its third - and most powerful - nuclear test."
149|Bomb blast in Philippines kills 4, wounds 30|MLANG: A bomb exploded at the entrance of a town market packed with New Year's Eve shoppers in the restive southern Philippines , killing four people and wounding at least 30 others, officials said.Police said they have no immediate suspects in the second such attack in two months, but Muslim rebels opposed to a peace deal with the government have been blamed for similar bombings in the past.Most of the victims were shoppers buying fruits and horns used for noise-making to greet the new year, said police chief Joan Resurreccion of Mlang township in North Cotabato province.Last month, a bomb blast at a billiard hall in the same town killed three people.``This is not a happy new year for us people in Mlang,'' said Mayor One suspect has been arrested in the previous bombing, but no group has claimed responsibility for either blasts.Minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation's south have been fighting for self-rule for decades. In March, the largest rebel group signed an autonomy deal with the government, but a breakaway faction called Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters was of several vowing to continue fighting.Authorities accused the rebels of carrying out a bus bombing that killed at least 10 people early this month in a province farther north. The rebels have denied responsibility.

Meanwhile, the institute estimates that 137 communities use speed cameras, up from 115 at the end of 2011.

Advocates for cameras that catch red-light runners point to data showing they reduce accidents, while critics note that they can’t employ judgment to distinguish between, say, a red-light run during rush hour in a school zone and a technically illegal right turn on a red light at 3 a.m.

Traffic cameras have also been contentious in Ohio, where the governor signed a bill this month requiring a police officer to be present for traffic-camera citations, something camera proponents say negates the practicality of using them to stretch police resources.

“It makes no sense to me,” said Adam Loukx, city law director for Toledo. “It seems worse than whatever they thought they were curing.”

State Sen. Bill Seitz, of Cincinnati, who sponsored the bill, said cameras can have their benefits in areas such as school zones, but they too often have resulted in needless ticketing for harmless offenses.

“I think the cities took a kernel of a good idea and put it on steroids and managed to anger a significant amount of the population,” Seitz said.

Critics also charge that towns are more interested in revenue than improving safety. Toledo resident Joel Clark said it’s clear to him that the cameras are money makers.

“They know where to put them to make the money,” he said. “My buddy got four in a week before he knew the camera was there. That’s what, $500? That’s crazy.”

Some consider the cameras a valuable safety tool, despite missteps.

“The research is clear that photo enforcement works,” said Russ Rader, IIHS senior vice president. “It’s effective in reducing violations and in reducing crashes, both red-light cameras and speed cameras. There is no question that lives will be lost because New Jersey has decided to end the program.”"

152|Man dies after being shot by Dothan police officer|"Man dies after being shot by Dothan police officer Posted: Tuesday, December 30, 2014 2:55 PM EST Updated: Wednesday, January 7, 2015 2:56 PM EST

Alabama Law Enforcement Agency officials say a man who was shot during an altercation with a police officer outside the Dothan City Animal Shelter has died of his injuries.

Alabama State Trooper Kevin Cook confirms that Robert Earl Lawrence, 30, died at 9:50 p.m. on Dec. 30 from the injuries he sustained in the officer-involved shooting. The Dothan Police Department says one of its officers shot Lawrence in the abdomen during an altercation earlier in the afternoon.

ALEA's State Bureau of Investigation is investigating the case as a matter of standard procedure due to an officer's involvement.

According to the Dothan Police Department, officers made contact with Lawrence at about 12:30 p.m. when he tried to turn a stray animal over to an employee at the shelter on Jerry Drive. Lawrence is said to have become disorderly after he was told he could not leave the animal without identification.

Police say Lawrence was told he was being placed under arrest at which time a physical altercation started. During the altercation, a Dothan police officer, not identified, fired a shot that struck the man in the abdomen.

Lawrence was transported to Southeast Alabama Medical Center with what police initially called non-life-threatening injuries. That status was later updated to indicate Lawrence was in critical condition. He later died from his injuries.

Pastor Michael Ford says he first met Lawrence 8-years-ago at the Slocomb Repair Shop, and on Monday he laid his friend and fellow church member to rest.

""Everybody was broken in spirit and heart,"" Ford said. ""No one is expecting a 30-year-old person's life to be over in such a short period of time.""

Ford, along with other family members, say the man authorities are depicting Lawrence as isn't the man they knew.

""He was dedicated to what he did,"" Ford said. ""He was a hard working person and he did a lot of stuff for me over the years.

""He was all about family and he was always there for his children. He would have given you the shirt off of his back,"" said Teresa Lawrence.

Married with three biological and two foster children, Ford believes Lawrence's troubles with the law began when the Geneva County DHR took his children. Court documents show that Lawrence plead guilty last year to harassing communications and making terrorist threats to a DHR employee.

""He never ever once had a disrespectful response to me. To me I can't see anything other then somebody you give time to and energy in to help steer in the right direction,"" said Ford.

Following the SBI's investigation, the findings will be turned over to the Houston County District Attorney's office.

153|Mom Accidentally Shot, Killed By Her Toddler Son in a Walmart|"An Idaho mom was shot and killed by her 2-year-old son while shopping at Walmart on Tuesday, ABC News reports. The Hayden, Idaho, store (located near Spokane, Washington) closed in order for police to investigate the incident.

Veronica Rutledge, 29, was visiting family for the holidays. She was shopping in the electronics section of the store with her son and three young girls, all relatives. Her son was sitting in the shopping cart when he pulled a handgun out of his mother's purse and pulled the trigger. He shot the gun at point-blank range, less than an arm's length away, and his mother died at the scene.

""He probably still doesn't even know what has happened,"" Lieutenant Stu Miller, a sheriff's office spokesperson, told The New York Times. ""This situation is such a tragedy, particularly happening so close to the holidays.""

The Washington Post reports that Rutledge's husband had given her a purse with a special pocket for a concealed weapon for Christmas. She had brought that purse with her to Walmart that day. Her toddler unzipped the special compartment while the purse was left unattended for a brief moment.

Her father-in-law, Terry Rutledge, told the newspaper he's furious at the media for painting Veronica as irresponsible. ""I brought my son up around guns, and he has extensive experience shooting it,"" he said. ""And Veronica had had handgun classes; they're both licensed to carry, and this wasn't just some purse she had thrown her gun into.""

A Walmart spokesperson told the Associated Press the shooting was ""a very sad and tragic accident,"" and the company is working with local authorities while they look into the incident.

154|The world counts down to the New Year|"The countdown to 2015 has begun as revellers around the world prepare to welcome in the New Year.

New Zealand and Australia were among the first to herald the New Year. An estimated 1.6million people gathered in Sydney to watch more than 10,000 aerial fireworks, 25,000 shooting comets and 100,000 pyrotechnic effects in the traditional New Year's Eve display over Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House.

A tribute to hostages killed in recent terror attacks in Australia was displayed on the pylons of the bridge during the main display.

Celebrations have been muted in Indonesia in the wake of the AirAsia Flight QZ8501 crash.

In Brazil, more than one million people have gathered on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach.

Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour was lit up by fireworks as spectators watched the display above the iconic Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.

And in New York, revellers have converged on Times Square for the annual dropping of the crystal ball as the clock strikes twelve.

North Korea had its first New Year's Eve celebration in the city three years ago, after Kim Jong-Un came to power following his father's death. Ringing in 2015, spectators in the capital Pyongyang were treated to a lavish display of fireworks at midnight.

In Edinburgh a three day Hogmanay festival is already underway in one of Europe's biggest year-end celebrations featuring a torch-lit procession of 35,000 people, including marching bands and troupes in full Viking regalia, and a fireworks display atop Calton Hill.

Meanwhile, in London, over 100,000 people have gathered along the River Thames to watch the annual fireworks display and hear the famous bongs of Big Ben as the clock turns twelve.

The New Year's Eve countdown will be beamed out from Europe's tallest skyscraper the Shard as the rest of the world continues to celebrate the arrival of 2015."
155|Unique New Year's welcomes across the country|"The concept of dropping a ball to mark the passage of time has its roots in maritime tradition. More than a century after the first Times Square New Year's Eve ball drop, the custom has taken on a life of its own, reports CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan.

In a growing number of cities around the country, it wouldn't be a New Year's celebration without falling food.

Atlanta drops a peach. Miami, a neon orange. And a MoonPie flies over Mobile, Alabama, to mark the start of the New Year.

In Lebanon, Pennsylvania, it's bologna. In Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, a pickle.

Not to be upstaged, a drag queen named ""Sushi"" descends over the streets of Key West, Florida.

The tradition of ringing in the New Year by dropping an object was born on top of The New York Times building in 1907. The city had banned fireworks, so the newspaper's publisher at the time, Adolph Ochs, went looking for a new way to mark the coming of the New Year. He adapted a maritime ritual.

""This was a tradition, a mariners' tradition from harbors where a ball would drop at a certain time of day to let all the ships at sea and in the harbor know what time it was,"" New York Times reporter David Dunlap said.

Ochs arranged to have a 700-pound illuminated ball lowered from the Times building flagpole precisely at midnight.

""It was a perfect and much less flammable way to bring in the New Year,"" Dunlap said.

Although today's celebrations often include pyrotechnics, the drop has endured.

In music city, Nashville, Tennessee, it's a 15-foot red note, while New Orleans appropriately lowers a fleur-de-lis.

Each drop marks the passing of times gone by, but it's the crowds that make the party.

""The ball is just in essence the stirrer in the cocktail that is really the energy of the crowd,"" Dunlap said.

Crowds started gathering in New York's Times Square the day before New Year's Eve, despite below-freezing temperatures forecast for the celebrations. Over a million people are expected to watch the ball drop in person this year."

157|Egypt court orders retrial for Greste|"Australian journalist Peter Greste and his two Al Jazeera colleagues are still behind bars despite an appeals court in Egypt ordering a retrial.

An appeal hearing in Cairo has ordered a retrial for Australian journalist Peter Greste and his two Al Jazeera colleagues.

But Greste, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed, who have been in jail for more than a year, were not granted bail.

The decision by Egypt's Court of Cassation came after a hearing that lasted only a few minutes.

The three journalists didn't attend the brief hearing in Cairo, which began about 9am local time on Thursday (1800 AEDT).

Journalists who gathered to report on the hearing weren't allowed in for those arguments, but later entered the court.

Defence lawyers said they believed a retrial for the three men would be held within a month.

Lois Greste, Peter Greste's mother, said after the hearing that the verdict was ""not as good as we hoped"".

Adel Fahmy, Mohammed Fahmy's brother, said he had hoped his brother would have been freed on Thursday.

He said each lawyer received three minutes to argue their stance on the case.

""I hoped for more today,"" he said.

The three journalists from the broadcaster's English service were detained in December 2013 for spreading false information.

Greste and Fahmy each got seven years, and Mohamed was jailed for 10.

""The Court of Cassation has accepted their appeal and ordered a retrial,"" Greste's defence lawyer Amr Al-Deeb said after the hearing.

Hopes for the journalists' release had grown following a thaw in relations between Cairo and Qatar, where their employer is based.

Both the defence and the prosecution had requested a retrial.

Egyptian authorities offered no immediate comment on the ruling.

Rallies were held in London and The Hague on December 29 as the Al Jazeera journalists marked one year behind bars.

Australian authorities had been hoping for a pardon or clemency in the lead-up to the anniversary, but they have received mixed messages from Egyptian ministries.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's Egyptian counterpart told her last week that there would be no pardon or clemency before the legal proceedings had taken their course.

Greste's parents Lois and Juris Greste visited their son in prison on Christmas Day, but they weren't able to give presents because of strict gift rules.

""It was a sombre occasion,"" his brother Mike Greste said on Monday.

""It has been a trying Christmas and certainly a lonely one.""

Rights groups dismissed the trial as a sham and foreign countries, including Australia and the US, have expressed their concern over the journalists' detention.

Authorities accused Qatar-based Al-Jazeera of acting as a mouthpiece for the Brotherhood.

The station denied the accusations and said the journalists were doing their job.

At trial, prosecutors offered no evidence backing accusations the three falsified footage to foment unrest."
158|125m mobile users in Pakistan may lose connections as telecom operators not able to re-verify SIMs within 28 day|"Lahore: More than 125 million pre-paid mobile phone users in Pakistan may lose their connections as telecom operators have expressed their inability to re-verify their subscribers within the 28-day deadline set by the government after a brutal Taliban attack on an army school in Peshawar.

Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan last week set the deadline for the top five telecom operators – Mobilink, Ufone, Telenor, Warid and Zong. He said the government did not want “free availability” of SIMs to militants. The Taliban militants who attacked the army-run school in Peshawar on December 16 that killed 150 people, most of them children, used a SIM (subscriber identification module) of one of these top five telecom operators. “We cannot re-verify over 125 million pre-paid connections in 28 days. If we are forced to so then eventually we will have to block the pre-paid SIMs to meet the deadline,” said a senior official of a cellular company.

He said the operators needed at least 150-200 days to complete the re-verification process. “We want a realistic period for the verification process,” he said, adding the general public would be the ultimate sufferer if the SIMs were blocked for a month. “The affected persons will rush to customer sale centres, franchises and retailers to get post-paid SIMs,” he added. According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, there are a total of 140 million mobile phone users. Of them 125 million are pre-paid and 15 million are post-paid. About a year ago, the PTA had introduced a biometric verification system to check the sale of illegal SIMs. However there are complaints of unauthorised sale of SIMs.

Telenor Pakistan official Mohammad Aslam Hayat said: “There is no such thing as unverified SIM. Every mobile operator has a record of SIM sales from its warehouse up to the retail level, where subscriptions are acquired. “Against every SIM sold, mobile operators have necessary data as per the regulatory requirement. However, this does not mean that the system is foolproof.” Hayat said the “dominant buyer” of bulk SIMs was a group of people involved in “grey” international incoming calls. “These grey traffickers are willing to pay very high prices, (reportedly up to Rs.5,000 a SIM), for these Sims which turns out to be a substantially motivating factor for some in retail channels to ignore the sale procedures laid down by the operators,” he said.

The PTA has called a meeting of all operators tomorrow to discuss a solution to the problem. “The Pakistan Rangers has also written to the PTA that the regional head of a cellular company of the SIM found in the use of a terrorist will be responsible,” an official said, adding the warning has created panic among the operators."

161|Gazprom says Ukraine has paid $150 mln for January gas|"(Adds detail, Naftogaz comments)

MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russian natural gas exporter Gazprom said on Wednesday that Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz had paid it $150 million for gas supplies in January, easing fears about possible gas flow disruptions to Europe.

Russia meets around a third of the European Union's gas demand, with about half of that piped through Ukraine.

Naftogaz said it had made pre-payments for 1 billion cubic metres (bcm) of Russian gas in total, including supplies it received in December not yet used up.

Last week, Gazprom said Naftogaz had used only 300 million cubic metres of Russian gas in December out of 1 bcm which Ukraine had paid for. The unused volumes will be shipped in January.

Gazprom stopped gas supplies to Ukraine in mid-June in a row over pricing and unpaid bills. It resumed deliveries this month after Ukraine made a prepayment and paid off part of its debt.

The current agreement on Russian gas supplies to Ukraine is valid until the end of the first quarter 2015.

Last week, Gazprom said it had received a $1.65 billion payment from Ukraine to cover the country's gas debts, which it had to cover before the year-end.

162|Commerce Department Essentially OKs Crude Oil Exports|"Without actual saying the words, the U.S. Department of Commerce on Tuesday made clear that the U.S. ban on crude oil exports has been lifted. The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said that it has approved requests by some companies to export lightly refined condensates and it has outlined how it will treat further requests for permission to export oil.

This is not exactly news. The BIS had approved in June requests from Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) and Pioneer Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE: PXD) to export the minimally refined condensates. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE: ENB) and Valero Corp. (NYSE: VLO) had received BIS permission in April to re-export crude from Canada that had been imported into the United States.

The news is that the agency has spelled out for the first time (in an FAQ of all places) what the rules are. The agency defines crude oil as liquid hydrocarbons that have not passed through a distillation tower. The definition includes “reconstituted crude petroleum, and lease condensate and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, gilsonate, and oil shale.” These may not be exported.

What may be exported are lease condensates that have been “processed through a crude oil distillation tower.” That passage transforms the unexportable crude into an exportable refined petroleum product. As the BIS notes, “Petroleum products are subject to few export restrictions.”

Why now after months of dithering around? Could it be that the Obama administration has figured out that exporting near-crude is more likely to keep crude oil costs low than it is to raise them. If U.S. crude from shale plays in North Dakota can get into the international market, and the Bakken producers can keep their costs under control, the United States may be able to take a bit of market share away from the Saudis.

At one time earlier this year when oil prices were climbing, some suggested that a series of scheduled releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve would push crude prices lower. The producers in the North Dakota and Texas accomplished the same thing without government intervention.

163|Do You Have The Confidence in How You Look: Remember Details Matter|"SEOUL - Asia's largest movie festival kicks off Thursday at a time when the region's influence on the global movie industry is on the rise.

Entering its 20th year in the South Korean port city, the Busan International Film Festival saw its influence and size expand in stride with the growth of box office sales in the region.



Asian countries fueled growth in the global film industry last year, while box office sales in the U.S. and Canada declined. With box office sales of $12.4 billion in 2014, the Asian region is the biggest and fastest-growing movie market in the world, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.



Despite the growing influence of Asian cinema in the world, the non-competition movie festival has kept its bar of pretense and hierarchy low, unlike the historic yet hierarchical Cannes Film Festival, which turned away some women in flat shoes from a premiere this spring.



Busan cinemagoers - in flats or heels, part of the media or not - do more than just gaze at award-winning directors, K-pop stars and Hollywood celebrities gracing the red carpet. They happily stay in queues from the wee hours to get tickets, ask questions to filmmakers and actors after screenings, and join public talk shows with them on the beach.



While the glamor and glitz will not be lost in Busan, most moviegoers and industry officials will travel to South Korea's second-largest city to discover the next-generation Wong Kar Wai or Ang Lee. The festival's New Currents section, which premieres Asian feature movies from novice directors, has broken major talents, including Venice Film Festival Golden Lion winner Jia Zhangke. Its Asian Cinema Fund program has provided financial lifelines to promising filmmakers.



""There are a lot of movies completed by support from the Asian Cinema Fund, introduced in Busan for the first time in the world and then went on to international acclaim,'' said Kim Jiseok, the Busan Film Festival's executive programmer.



The festival has not been without challenges during its 20-year ride. The most recent setback was the budget cut by South Korea's government after the festival went ahead with the screening of a controversial documentary last year despite pressure not to.



The state-run Korean Film Council cut its support to the film festival this year by nearly half to 800 million won ($677,000) from 1.46 billion won ($1.2 million). Many viewed the budget cut as punishment for the festival's decision to screen the documentary, which was about the 2014 sinking of a ferry that left hundreds of people dead, most of them South Korean students on a school trip, and the government's much-criticized rescue operation.



""I felt then that our society's democracy had a long way to go,'' Kim said.



After the standoff with the government, Kang Soo-yeon, an award-winning actress, was appointed the festival's co-director. She has since vowed to stand for the value of freedom of expression.



After its opening on Thursday with ""Zubaan,'' an India coming-of-age drama, the festival will screen 303 movies from 75 countries, including 94 world premieres.

People attend the opening ceremony of the Busan International Film Festival at Busan Cinema Center in Busan, South Korea, Oct. 1, 2015.









The glamor and glitz will be at its height when the A-listed celebrities walk the red carpet under the futuristic roof of the Busan Cinema Center on Thursday evening. The center's 85-meter (280-foot) -long roof displays moving images on its curvy metal surface, with lights beaming from hundreds of thousands of LED lamps. It provides what has become the festival's key image since its completion in 2011, as well as the official poster image this year.



An equally impressive list of movie stars is expected to walk the red carpet. From South Korea, iconic actress Jeon Do-yeon, who served as the Cannes Film Festival's feature section jury last year, will make an appearance. Heartthrobs Jung Woo-sung and Lee Jung-jae are expected to impress K-pop fans, while actress Tang Wei, who commands big followers in South Korea, will return to Busan on the first day of the festival.



A legion of veteran Asian filmmakers will gather to celebrate the festival's 20th edition as well. Chinese filmmakers Jia Zhangke and Hou Hsiao-hsien and director Johnnie To from Hong Kong are among those scheduled to join the opening ceremony. Silvia Chang, the veteran actress and director from Taiwan, is set to greet audiences as the head the New Currents section jury. Japanese director Kore-eda Hirokazu and Apichatpong Weerasethakul from Thailand are among those expected to be spotted on the streets of the harbor city, although their attendance at the red carpet event remains unconfirmed.



From Europe and the U.S., Nastassja Kinski, the German model and actress, is set to attend the festival for the first time as part of the jury. Sophie Marceau, Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton, a frequent visitor to South Korea, will also be there.

From left, Indian director Mozez Singh, actress Sarah Jane Dias, actor Vicky Kaushal and actor Raaghav Chanana smile during a press conference for the Busan International Film Festival opening movie "" Zubaan"" in Busan, South Korea, Oct.1, 2015.





While Greater China, Japan and South Korea have been the preoccupation of the festival, this year's edition will see a rise of movies, actors and directors from outside East Asia. The co-host of the opening ceremony is Marina Golbahari, an actress from Afghanistan whose breakout role in the 2003 movie ""Osama'' gave her fame. Out of the eight movies competing for a prize at the New Currents section, four are from outside China, Japan or South Korea. The section dedicated to unearthing hidden talents of Asian cinema has selected directors from Iran, Kazakhstan and India, showing the rise of emerging filmmakers beyond East Asia.







A special section of the festival will feature a rare chance to watch black and white movies from South Korea made in the 1960s, when the country saw a sudden surge in movie making and watching. ""The DMZ,'' by the late director Park Sangho, is more than a work of historic importance. It is the first movie that was shot in the demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas, depicting the country's division through the eyes of two children. ""The Body Confession'' and ""The Door of the Body'' describe the lives of prostitutes.







Many Asian movies to be premiered at this year's festival mirror angst toward society's hyper-competitive system or raise questions about society's treatment of those who are left behind. ""Reach for the Sky'' is a documentary that takes a rare look at the lives of South Korean high school students before and after they take the crucial college entrance exam that is believed to determine one's success in life. The fictional drama ""4th Place"" is a story of a teenage swimmer who is beat by his coach to improve his record and his mother who overlooks violence in favor of a better score. ""Collective Invention,'' inspired by the Hwang Woo-suk scandal and his rise and fall, touches on various subjects, including youth unemployment and skewed media coverage.



A number of movies this year bring their focus to the life and death of the elderly in Asia. ""Ashes to Ashes'' is a South Korean documentary about a man who holds funerals for those without any family. ""Radio Set'' tells a story of an old Indian man whose attachment to an analogue radio causes friction with his son."

166|NZ's top stocks of 2014|"Infrastructure company Chorus is 2014's best-performing stock on the NZX 50 gross index, giving shareholders returns of almost 85 per cent over the year.

Almost 30 per cent of its gains followed a draft decision from the Commerce Commission last month on how much the Wellington-based lines company could charge internet retailers for access to its copper lines.

The draft price, which won't be finalised until later this year, was higher than what Chorus is presently allowed to charge under an earlier decision from the regulator.

Chorus last month said the new pricing, if enacted, would reduce its annual earnings by $80 million.

While this appears to be nothing to celebrate, it is less than half the $170 million the company said would come off its annual earnings under the present pricing regime. Chorus shares hit a 14-month high on the back of the news.

Chorus owns the country's copper-wire phone network and is also building the bulk of the Government's ultra-fast broadband scheme.

Three companies involved in the Government's state asset sale programme were also among the top five best performers last year.

Mighty River Power, after its shares sank 23 per cent below its listing price last January, gave returns of 42.24 per cent in the year.

The electricity company's share price hit a high of $3.10 in December, after National returned to power and the spectre of regulation in the market vanished.

Meridian Energy shares also rallied after National's September 20 election win and the stock was the second top performer, offering returns of 71.75 per cent.

Air New Zealand came in at number four, with returns of 57.94 per cent.

After taking a pounding in 2013, shares in Diligent Board Member Services bounced back last year, offering returns of 38.42 per cent.

Although the firm, which provides cloud-based software used by directors to access documents, has been plagued by reporting issues, analysts see all that being behind the company.

""The company continues to generate solid free cash flow, has no debt, and benefits in translational terms from a weaker New Zealand dollar,"" said Rickey Ward, New Zealand equities manager at JBWere.

In November, Diligent lifted its full-year revenue guidance to between US$82.5 million ($106.6 million) and US$83 million, which would be an increase of up to 28 per cent on the previous year. Net income for the nine months to September 30 rose more than 30 per cent to US$6.9 million from the same period of 2013.

Fisher & Paykel Healthcare also ranked among the best-performing stocks, with returns of 62.34 for the year. This followed the company posting record financial results and in December analysts saw it being well positioned with growth options and earnings momentum.

Investors also appear to be buying the story of Spark's metamorphosis, with returns of 35.14 per cent.

The company changed its name from Telecom in August, as a ""marker"" that its future was different from its past. Spark is part-way through its transformation from being an infrastructure company to a ""digital services provider"". So far that has seen it launch products like Lightbox, an online television service.

In October Spark briefly reclaimed the top spot as the most valuable company on the NZX.

167|Oakbank Primary School construction making ‘rapid’ progress|"The construction of an £8.5 million Perth school project is “on time and on budget”, the local councillor has revealed.

Councillor Willie Wilson said he is delighted with the latest feedback on Oakbank Primary and is looking forward to visiting the site in the near future along with other councillors.

“It is great to see the work on the replacement school progressing so quickly,” he said.

“The council has advised that the building programme is on time and on budget.

“It is anticipated that the building programme will be completed by the summer of 2015 and that the pupils and staff will move in then.”

Work began on the build in April and pupils were able to continue to take lessons in their current classrooms while the construction is under way on-site at Viewlands Road West, between Perth High School and Perth Academy.

In due course, the old school will make way for impressive new sporting facilities.

The decision to replace the school was taken following an extensive review of the 1960s building, which ruled out refurbishment.

Oakbank is one of the so-called Clasp schools built in the 1960s — prefabricated school buildings that were cheaply constructed out of light steel frames.

The construction method appeared hugely successful and also became used for office buildings but the design later proved problematic and flawed.

Its structure was said to have deteriorated so much that replacement was the only sensible option and so state-of-the-art new facilities are now being created. The new 4,000 square metre-school will be built on two levels and will boast a contemporary, flat-roofed design, together with an integrated nursery, a roof terrace, a learning resource centre, a general-purpose room and break-out areas.

Joining Mr Wilson on the forthcoming site visit will be councillors Alexander Stewart, Bob Band and Alistair Munro.

Mr Stewart was enthusiastic about the project, saying: “The pupils and staff are looking forward a great deal to moving into the new building and there is an air of excitement in the school, as many of the youngsters have been using the building project as a way of learning about construction and building techniques.”

The convener of lifelong learning, Bob Band, said the completion of the project is highly anticipated. “The reconstruction of the school is of vital importance, to ensure we provide 21st Century educational facilities for our young people,” he said.

Alistair Munro added: “I am looking forward a great deal to visiting this exciting project again and it is great to see the building work getting on so rapidly.”"

31/12/2014 2:53 pm EDT

SEDCO Development, one of the pioneering Jeddah based real estate developers and a subsidiary of SEDCO Holding Group, signed with Dar Al Wessal, a company specialized in marketing residential projects, to market its residential units. These units pertain to the AlAhli SEDCO Residential Development Fund and are located in the Salamah District 2 in Jeddah.

With a wide expertise in the Saudi real estate market, SEDCO Development is executing this project on a 25.934 sqm plot of land, which was previously acquired by the fund through SEDCO development, the main developer. This project consists of approximately 372 Residential units with different dimensions thus fulfilling the rising demand in the sector of residential units in Jeddah.

According to the CEO of SEDCO Development Company, Engineer Khalid Jamjoom, the distinguishing factor of this project is its proximity to key points in Jeddah, such as Al Madinah Road, Heraa and Quraish streets, providing easy access as well as its distinct design for the project, fulfilling all requirements for residential environments aligned with the community’s privacy.

This project is considered one of the typical residential projects targeting those with middle to upper income home buyer especially in terms of what is offered in the real estate market when it comes to design, planning and the distribution of parks and green areas.

NCB Capital has previously announced that this close-end investment fund aims to develop the existing capital and achieve yearly internal revenue for investors worth 10 percent."

»

""Put yourself in my place."" It's a line heard a number of times in ""Two Days, One Night,"" the exquisitely simple and moving new film from Belgium's Dardenne brothers.

It's central to the story, but doesn't the line also encapsulate what cinema is supposed to accomplish, essentially? Forcing us to put ourselves in the place of those onscreen and to wonder, often with discomfort: What would I do?

Not all filmmakers pull it off, but it's something the Dardennes, Jean-Pierre and Luc, are remarkably good at — making us understand just what we share with their characters, working-class people in industrial Belgian cities who are decidedly neither heroes nor villains, just ordinary folk trying to get by.

And their effort is even more remarkable here, because the writer-directors are working for the first time with a bona fide, glamorous movie star: Marion Cotillard. The fact that it works so well is a tribute both to Cotillard's committed, selfless work and to the Dardennes' unerringly authentic instincts.

Cotillard plays Sandra, a mother of two young children who works at a solar panel factory. It's significant that we never see Sandra actually doing her work. It doesn't matter. Over the course of the film we'll learn just how important that work is — not simply to her economic survival, but to her very identity and sense of place in the world.

Advertisement

The action unfolds at a deliberate pace. Only gradually do we realize Sandra has been on a medical leave for depression. As the film begins, we know only that she's been hit with a severe blow: The boss has determined that 16 workers can perform the job of 17, with a little overtime. Her fellow workers have been given a choice — a 1,000-euro bonus ($1,200), or Sandra's return. They've voted for the money.

But Sandra wins a second chance: A new ballot, on Monday morning. All she has to do is convince a majority of the 16 to give up their bonus. She has, as the title says, two days and one night.

With the help of a concerned and supportive husband (Fabrizio Rongione), Sandra heads out to knock on doors. Each of these encounters is painful. Sandra is a mass of jangled nerves, prone to popping Xanax to get through the day, or escaping to bed in the afternoon. She hardly feels capable of arguing for her economic survival.

The Dardennes don't make it easy for her, and they don't make it easy for us. No shortcuts are taken. We hear Sandra speak the same excruciating lines, plead the same case, again and again. This mundane repetition — rare in the movies — is just one aspect of the Dardennes' filmmaking that gives it such a powerfully naturalistic feel.

Cotillard is hugely effective at conveying this elemental struggle — not just for her job, but for her sense of self-worth, and, not to overstate it, for her life. With no makeup, a messy ponytail and a uniform of jeans and tank tops revealing colorful bra straps, Cotillard is stripped of glamour. But her struggle is also reflected in her eyes — at times empty and glassy, at others steely and determined. And even in her gait. Watch her trudge reluctantly toward another difficult doorstep encounter. Her body seems weighted down by dread.

The finale is redemptive, yes, but not in the way you expect. Not surprisingly, it's the most un-Hollywood of endings. As we watch Sandra trek off down yet another urban pathway, growing smaller as the world grows bigger, we're struck in a very visual sense how her story is just one of many, equally powerful ones — in her town, in her country, in the world at large. Few filmmakers drive this universality home as well as the Dardennes.

""Two Days, One Night,"" an IFC Films release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America ""for some mature thematic elements."" Running time: 95 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.

174|Texas Was the Number One 'Magnet State' in the USA in 2014|"Everybody wants to be a Texan.

News Radio 1200 WOAI's Michael Board reports Allied Van Lines reported renting more moving equipment and vehicles to families moving to Texas than moving to any other state in 2014.

It's the tenth straight year that Texas has been the nation's number one 'magnet state.'

""This is predominately due to employment opportunities as well as the weather,"" United Vice President Lesli Bertoli told News Radio 1200 WOAI.

She says the renting and hiring of Allied Van Lines equipment is the most reliable barometer of adults moving to states for economic or social reasons, because people who are motivated to rent or hire a moving company are generally established families with children who are moving for 'serious purposes.' The survey, for example, doesn't include teenager who throw their stuff into the back seat to go to college.

""Perhaps they are being transferred by their company, or maybe they are retirees looking for a better climate.""

Bertoli's numbers are reflected in Census Bureau numbers which show that Texas has added 1.3 million new residents since April 2010, and has increased non government jobs by 12% since 2007.

""For the last decade Texas has been a very strong destination for all of our customers, both corporate and consumer,"" she said.

She says Florida was the number two 'magnet state' in 2014, followed by Arizona, South Carolina and Colorado.

Bertoli says California righted the ship in 2014, jumping from an outbound state to a magnet state. She says California was the 7th biggest state in the country for people leaving in 2013, but moved to becoming the 15th most popular state for people moving in this year.

Similarly, she says Washington and Oregon are now attracting more residents than they are losing, reversing a trend that continued throughout the Great Recession.

All three Pacific Coast states saw a massive influx of residents form other places from the 1950s through the 1980s.

So what states are people abandoning today?

Bertoli says they're getting the heck out of Illinois as rapidly as they can, with the Land of Lincoln remaining the number one outbound state, followed by Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, and New Jersey."

176|Police kill Pennsylvania man as he tried to run down officers|"(Reuters) - Police in Pennsylvania shot and killed a man on Tuesday who tried to use his car to run over officers as they attempted to arrest him on charges of making online terroristic threats against law enforcement, officials said.

Police in Upper Darby Township, a suburb of Philadelphia, were trying to serve an arrest warrant on the 52-year-old man when the late afternoon shooting occurred on a well-traveled intersection, a department official said.

As officers approached, the suspect put his car in reverse, stepped on the gas, and rammed a police vehicle, a police report said.

Five officers opened fire, Upper Darby police said. No officers were wounded.

""The officers were in fear of their lives and did what they had to do,"" Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

""He threatened to kill police, threatened to kill FBI agents,"" he told the newspaper.

The suspect, identified as Joseph Pacini, was wanted on charges of making terroristic threats on social media, including YouTube, against police and the FBI, the official said.

Court records showed Pacini had been arrested twice in Philadelphia in the past 10 years, and was previously charged in 2005 with making terroristic threats and possessing instruments of crime, among other charges, but those were withdrawn, the Inquirer reported.

It was unclear if he had family in the area.

178|Calls for fire safety in residential buildings|"Saudi Gazette report







AL-AHSA — Many citizens have called on authorities to intensify campaigns to raise public awareness about the importance of having fire extinguishers at home, Alsharq newspaper reported.



The concerned citizens said most families are unaware of the importance of fire extinguishers and a significant number of people do not know how to use them. Although laws require public buildings to meet all safety requirements, especially fire prevention precautions, they do not require residential buildings to meet the same requirements nor are they required to have fire alarms installed.



Meeting safety requirements is currently not a prerequisite for the construction of residential buildings and the only requirement for such buildings is to have emergency exits.



Citizen Ahmad Al-Eneizi said he has fire extinguishers all over his house and replaces them every six months. “Everyone should have them. They’re important. We should train our children how to use them when necessary. It’s better to be safe than sorry,” Al-Eneizi said.



In his opinion, training will reduce the risks of fatalities and damage caused by fire accidents.



Muhammad Al-Hemaidi, another citizen, said the only way to make people purchase fire extinguishers for their homes is to pass a law and strictly enforce it.



Abdulaziz Al-Saleem believes that schools should educate students and show them how to use fire extinguishers and how to deal with a fire accident.



“The Civil Defense should also explain to people why it’s important to have fire extinguishers. Municipalities should only issue construction licenses after inspectors ensure that the license applicant has met all safety requirements,” he said.



A Civil Defense spokesman urged the public to have their water heaters and regular heaters checked by technicians, especially during the winter season. Kitchens and bedrooms should have smoke detectors, noting that poor quality wires, high electric loads and absence of any type of maintenance are the main causes of home fires."
179|Yahya Jammeh, Gambian leader, returns to country after apparent coup attempt|"Gambia's President Yahya Jammeh arrived back in Banjul on Wednesday, official sources said, one day after gunfire erupted around the presidential palace and the government denied media reports of a coup attempt.

Jammeh was in France or Dubai when violence broke out and he returned home via N'Djamena, where he told officials from Chad during a refuelling stop on Tuesday evening that he planned to return home.

Jammeh, 49, himself took power in a coup 20 years ago and since then has stifled dissent in his impoverished West African nation. He has come under increasing criticism from abroad over issues ranging from human rights to his claims he can cure AIDS.

Banks reopened on Wednesday, people headed to work and the city's key Denton Bridge was also open, witnesses said.

On Tuesday, state radio played traditional music and an announcer read a government statement playing down the incident.

""Contrary to rumours being circulated, peace and calm continue to prevail in The Gambia,"" it said. ""(The) government would like to urge the public and all businesses to continue with their normal activities.""

Gambia, a splinter of land wedged into Senegal, has ocean beaches that attract tourists, particularly during the northern hemisphere's winter. They include about 60,000 Britons a year. The British foreign office advised its citizens to stay indoors and avoid public gatherings.

Witnesses in the centre of Banjul, which is situated on an island and connected to rest of the city by the Denton Bridge, said on Tuesday that security forces were stationed on street corners and patrolled streets after hours of shooting earlier in the day.

This year the European Union withdrew millions of dollars in aid, shortly after Jammeh signed into law an act that could imprison homosexuals for life. In 2012, he was criticized for executing nine people being held in prison."

181|BlackBerry the surprising savior for hacked Sony|"BlackBerry the surprising savior for hacked Sony

A drawer of old BlackBerry phones unexpectedly helped keep Sony Pictures working, with staff resurrecting cast-aside tech and old-school methods to keep the hacked movie firm operational. Finding their own systems had been brought down by the hacking group known as ""Guardians of Peace"", Sony Pictures techs turned instead to BlackBerry's external servers, two new background pieces on the chronology of the cyberattack reveal, which kept email services running despite three-quarters of Sony's own servers having been destroyed.

More than just email was disrupted, however. The hackers had been thorough in their raid, pulling everything from unreleased movies through to personnel files and medical records.

In their wake, they left destruction. Servers were either digitally trashed or simply wiped clean, the New York Times reports, and staff were faced with little more than offensive images when they turned on their computers.

Luckily, Canada's finest stepped in to, if not save the day, then at least keep the studio running. A stack of neglected BlackBerry handsets was unearthed, the WSJ reports, and luckily were found to be still operational and with service.

Since BlackBerry's email system relies on the company's own servers, access was still available despite Sony's infrastructure being so critically impaired.

Meanwhile, those without a company phone resorted to their own cellphones, relying on web-based email like Gmail for communications, and set up elaborate messaging trees to make sure important news was escalated and distributed appropriately.

It seems unlikely that the hack would have been prevented had Sony Pictures actively been relying on BlackBerry service in the first place, but it does at least show the extreme value of having a backup plan (or perhaps of simply neglecting to deactivate old devices).

According to the NYT, Sony ended up blindsided by President Obama's surprisingly critical reaction, not having expected the Commander in Chief to effectively accuse them of giving in to terrorists.

Mis-communication is blamed for that, with Sony failing to explain that, while a theatrical release of The Interview had been delayed, it was still negotiating the online release that eventually happened through Google Play and other outlets.

Sony still has work to do restoring its infrastructure, with execs suggesting it could take 5-7 weeks before that happens. It's unclear whether BlackBerry devices will still be in the pockets of execs once the regular systems are running again.

Meanwhile, investigations into the root of the hack are still underway. The FBI has already blamed North Korea for being behind the exploit, despite some experts arguing that perpetrators closer to home were in fact responsible.

183|2 Avenues sex workers face theft charges|"TWO sex workers from Harare’s Avenues area who allegedly thought they had struck a jackpot after stealing over $2 000 from a client yesterday appeared in court facing charges of theft.

STAFF REPORTER

Portia Chimusaru (25) and Charity Gwatsvaira (22) of Kenedine Court in the Avenues were not asked to plead when they appeared before Harare magistrate Tendai Mahwe.

They were remanded to January 15, 2015 on $100 bail. As part of the bail conditions, they were also ordered to reside at their given address and not to interfere with State witnesses.

State counsel Sharon Mashavira told the court that the complainant invited Chimusaru and Gwatsvaira for dinner at his Northhood residence in Mt Pleasant, Harare, on December 28.

Chimusaru went to sleep with the complainant at around 11pm, while Gwatsvaira slept in a separate room.

The accused persons allegedly woke during the night and stole $2 638 which was on a desk under complainant’s folders.

According to State papers, Chimusaru and Gwatsvaira are the only outsiders who slept in the house prior to the missing of the money. It is further alleged that they also saw complainant hiding the money under some folders."

186|D.C. streetcars to be running by week of Jan. 19, Mayor Gray says|"WASHINGTON (WJLA) - The District made it official Wednesday morning: the streetcar won't be opening in 2014.

7 On Your Side learned New Year's Eve that no one in D.C. government seems to know when the streetcar will open. But what they do know is the project has already cost District taxpayers $123 million for 2 miles of track on H Street.

Despite years of delays, setbacks and funding issues, Mayor Gray has maintained it would be running by the end of 2014. And they held out hope, until Wednesday.

""I only see the empty car running all the time,"" commented H Street resident Hanna Jang. ""How many times do they need to practice?""

For residents of H Street in D.C., the streetcar saga continues. ""It's too expensive,"" said another resident. ""The money can go better to other things in the city.""

Years ago, outgoing Mayor Vincent Gray's original streetcar vision was highly ambitious, with 37 miles of city tracks. But from that vision, only 2 miles of rail have been laid, from Union Station to Benning Road.

""To me, it's just like everything else in D.C., it's a process to get it going,"" stated resident Christina Dunne. ""I don't know that anyone is surprised by it, but frustrated for sure.""

On Monday, ABC 7 was told by DDOT it hoped to have the streetcars running by Dec. 31. Several ""no-parking"" signs were even posted marking a ""special event"" to make the announcement. But late Tuesday, the signs came down. Then, at 5:45 a.m. Wednesday, the mayor's office released a statement saying the streetcars have not received the proper safety and security permits from the State Safety Oversight Office, which is part of D.C. Fire and EMS. ABC 7 was told the streetcars are ""exceedingly close to carrying passengers."" But no start date was given.

""It's really a beautiful thing,"" said Fady Joubran, who owns Micho's Lebanese Grill. ""It will bring more business.""

The small business owner was clearly excited on Monday when we first interviewed him. At the time, he thought the streetcars were close to running. This is him on Dec. 31:

""We are really frustrated,"" stated Joubran. ""We've been promised so many times. I think it's about time they act on it and get something done.""

ABC 7 did reach out to Mayor-elect Bowser to find out what her plans are for the streetcars, but we were told the mayor-elect is focused on her inauguration and she will address the streetcar issue next week. Our calls to the Safety Oversight Office to find out exactly what the holdup is were not returned.

On Wednesday evening, Mayor Gray released the following statement:

""DDOT and District safety inspectors continue to work together to open the DC Streetcar to passenger service. Safety continues to be our top priority. And while we know that the first day of service is going to be a great day for District residents, we don't want to rush for the sake of rushing,"" said Mayor Gray. ""With that in mind, though, I am now delighted to report that the week of January 19, 2015 is the target for getting H Street up to full speed.""

Two have been asked to return ""unlawful gains"" of $92 million (about Rs 580 crore). These entities are six individuals - Devanathan Sundararajan, Sarvesh Goorha, Ravi Chilikuri, Sanjay Rai Malhotra, Gagan Rastogi and Deep Rastogi - and two firms, Honor Finance and Asiatexx Enterprises.

188|Lessons from Goya: Reflections on 'order' and 'disorder' in 2014|"BOSTON – The Spanish master Francisco Goya painted 200 years ago at a time not unlike the age of disruption, revolution, barbarity and torture that defined the year 2014.

The last 12 months have presented a descending darkness amid streaks of piercing light that feels straight out of one of Goya ’s canvases. Painting in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Goya captured the tumult of the invasion and occupation of Spain by Napoleonic forces. He created searing scenes that seem strikingly relevant in 2014 as we look back on a year of darkness and light.

The darkness: ISIS and Boko Haram brought us to new depths while Russian President Vladimir Putin seems intent on returning Russia to the gray twilight of a retro, Cold War dictatorship.

The light: An agreement on climate change with China, a diplomatic opening with Cuba, immigration reform and an economic recovery that seems to be holding steady.

Framing the darkness and the light of 2014 was a wider struggle between the forces of “order"" and ""disorder.” It's a dividing line between those governed by inclusive democracies and the ungoverned, where militias, tribes and extremists make up their own rules within failed states.

This idea of ""order"" versus ""disorder"" was even a theme of a series of columns by the New York Times' Thomas Friedman over the summer.

But Goya was way ahead of Friedman in helping us understand the moment in which we live. Indeed, the current exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which frames the painter’s life and his work, is even titled “Order and Disorder.”

And Goya’s work, particularly his fascination with ‘disorder’ and the fear and sorrow it engenders in everyday people, offers a prescient way to calibrate our own response to the 2014 news cycle.

Francisco Goya y Lucientes, Two Men Fighting, 1812-20 (Courtesy)

The self-proclaimed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria brought us ‘disorder’ and darkness with grotesque images of brutality. This year, ISIS came to embody the complex challenges that lie ahead for the US military as it tries to decode the dangers of rising Islamic militancy.

The year 2014 will also be remembered for the horrors of Nigeria’s Boko Haram, in taking nearly 300 schoolgirls hostage, and the ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban on an army-run boys’ school in Peshawar, which killed 132 children. And it will be remembered for the more invisible, antiseptic barbarity revealed by the US Senate Select Committee’s investigation into the use of torture by the CIA.

For those of us at GlobalPost and The GroundTruth Project, 2014 will be remembered with great sadness as the year we saw our friend and colleague James Foley murdered by ISIS. He, along with two other American freelance journalists, was held at knife point by an ISIS leader and then decapitated while cameras rolled. These barbaric attacks were beamed out across the World Wide Web as some kind of perverse social networking, recruitment tool for ISIS.

This year will be remembered as a time when retro Cold War tensions came back into fashion, when Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to go from corrupt authoritarian to outright dictatorship, stumbling forward into the new year like one of Goya’s frightening giants that stomp across the landscape.

It will also be recorded as a year when the forces of “order” failed in diplomacy. Secretary of State John Kerry dedicated himself to an extraordinary but ultimately fruitless effort to reach a break through in the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and in talks on Iran’s nuclear program. Instead of progress, Iran walked away for a pause in talks and the Israelis and Palestinians watched as the conflict reached a new depth of tribalism and barbarity.

But for every hue of darkness there was in 2014, there seemed to come a contrasting streak of light trying to shine through.

President Obama announced an agreement with China to reduce greenhouse gasses. He announced an immigration reform package that seems to be rationalizing the US borders. And he set diplomatic relations with Cuba on a path to normalization after 50 years of a blockade that did little to effect any change for the people of Cuba. And through all of these positive developments, the economy also showed signs of flickering to life.

Back in 1808, Goya was seeing the same shades of darkness, and he was also searching for bands of light. He was witnessing the violent Spanish insurrection against occupation by Napoleonic forces. And he lived through the desperate famine that followed and sketched the thin faces of suffering.

Francisco Goya y Lucientes, The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, drawn and etched 1797-98, published 1799 (Courtesy)

Those experiences led to Goya’s searing indictment of war and its horrors, captured in a collection of etchings that came to be called “The Disasters of War.”

Through those years, Goya was a practitioner of ‘ground truth.’ One etching of women and children frozen in fear as they fled the onslaught of approaching troops, was succinctly titled: “Yo lo vi.” Or, “I saw this.”

These images of violence that Goya saw firsthand inspired his depictions of clumsy and ominous giants that stumble across war-torn landscapes.

Gruesome scenes of writhing bodies with severed heads and perversely detailed images of torture seem vivid commentaries on today.

After a visit to see Goya’s work at the Prado Museum in Madrid, the legendary art critic Bernard Berenson remarked, “Here in Goya is the beginning of our modern anarchy.”

And now, it seems, that anarchy is upon us.

But it is worth noting that the exhibit in Boston concludes with one of Goya’s later works, the “Last Communion of Saint Joseph of Calasanz.” The oil on canvas depicts an image of redemption for its subject, revealed through a beam of light that streaks down through the darkness.

Bank Muscat al Mazyona 2015 prize money raised to 9m rials Staff reporter



MUSCAT



Marking the Sultanate’s 45th Renaissance anniversary, Bank Muscat has announced the biggest prize money of 9 million rials for its 2015 al Mazyona savings scheme. This will be a 1 million-rial increase from last year. During the first half of the year, there has been a 15 per cent rise in savings.



Structured on the thematic ‘45’ reflecting the Sultanate’s 45 years of Renaissance under the leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, the savings scheme campaign reaches out with a call to action ‘Save more, Dream big’, according to bank officials.



The enhanced prize money will be shared by more winners as customers from all regions are guaranteed to win prizes ranging from 45,000 rials a week to 450,000 rials a month and 1.5 million rials at the end of the year. A special prize draw offering 450,000 rials to celebrate the 45th National Day is another highlight.



The 2015 al Mazyona scheme includes exclusive prizes earmarked for women, youth, children and high savings balance customers.



Branches deputy general manager Said Al Badai said, “Coinciding with Oman’s 45th Renaissance anniversary, Bank Muscat is elevating the al Mazyona experience. The al Mazyona 2015 scheme continues to reflect innovative customer segmentation based on two principles, region and demographics, ensuring a higher winning chance to all customers across the Sultanate. Customers are not required to block their money for long or wait for a long time to win big prizes.”



With 45 weekly prizes, including three for Zeinah women customers, reserved for every region, customers have a very good chance to win 1,000 rials with just a minimum balance of 100 rials. Customers get one chance for every 100 rial balance. Women customers are eligible to participate in the other prize draws in addition to the three weekly prizes exclusively reserved for them by becoming a Zeinah account holder.



Customers maintaining a minimum balance of 1,000 rials get a chance to win 10,000 every month. Customers are entitled to 10 winning chances. Forty-five monthly prizes, including one each for asalah priority banking, privilege banking and Zeinah customers, totaling 450,000 rials, are reserved for customers covering all regions. The more the balance, the higher the winning chances, he added.



On the National Day, 10 customers maintaining a minimum balance of 1,000 rials get a chance to win the big prize of 45,000 rials.



The grand year-end prizes total up to 1.5 million rials to be shared by 15 winners, including one from asalah priority banking. Customers maintaining a minimum balance of 1000 rials are eligible for the grand prize draws



The asalah priority banking customers maintaining a minimum balance of 30,000 rials are eligible to participate in all al Mazyona prize draws, in addition to exclusive draws earmarked for them. Customers maintaining a minimum balance of 10,000 rials are eligible to participate in all al Mazyona prize draws, in addition to exclusive monthly draws.



Zeinah account holders maintaining a minimum balance of 100 rials have three weekly prizes of 1,000 rials each. Children’s account holders with a monthly balance of 50 rials get a chance to win 45 prizes of 100 rials each every month. Shababi account holders with just 10 rials get a chance to win 300 rials every month. In all, there will be 45 winners every month in the youth category.



Shababi account holders are also eligible for other al Mazyona prizes.



A continuing attraction is that the winning chances get multiplied by the number of years customers are associated with al Mazyona savings scheme.



Product and service management head Amjad Iqbal Al Lawati said that 2015 was very special for Oman celebrating the 45th Renaissance anniversary.

191|Welcome refugees and reject racism, Merkel says after rallies|"Update: 11:33, 31 December 2014 Wednesday

Welcome refugees and reject racism, Merkel says after rallies

World Bulletin/News Desk

Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to turn their backs on a growing far-right movement of anti-Muslim protesters, calling them racists full of hatred, and said Europe's biggest economy must welcome people fleeing conflict and war.

In an unusually strongly worded New Year address that also condemned Russia for its actions in Ukraine, Merkel said it was essential for Germany to help the children of persecuted people to grow up without fear.

Many Germans are complaining of asylum seekers, many from Syria, pouring into the country. A new movement, Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA), is holding weekly rallies in the eastern city of Dresden.

Referring to protests that took place before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Merkel said, ""Today many people are again shouting on Mondays: 'We are the people'. But in fact they mean: You do not belong - because of the colour of your skin or your religion.

""So I say to everyone who goes to such demonstrations: Do not follow those who are appealing to you! Because too often there is prejudice, coldness, even hatred, in their hearts.""

Partly in response to its Nazi past, German asylum rules are among the most liberal in the world. Asylum granted elsewhere had helped many opponents of the Nazi regime to survive.

The number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany has surged to about 200,000 this year, four times the numbers in 2012. Net immigration has hit a two-decade high.

Consequently, immigration has moved up on the political agenda. Some members of Merkel's conservative bloc worry that they risk losing support if they do not respond to voter fears.

Growing support for PEGIDA's marches - a week ago more than 17,000 attended - and the popularity of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party since it shifted its focus from euro-scepticism to immigration is causing shockwaves in Berlin.

Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, also reiterated that Russia had questioned the foundation of Europe's peaceful order - self-determination - with its actions in Ukraine. She said Europe would not allow Russia to abuse human rights."

By A E James

Bank Muscat has a market share of 8.8 per cent in stock broking business, while Gulf Baader has a share of 10.5 per cent for the first eleven months of 2014, making these firms fifth and second, respectively, in terms of market share among brokerages houses on the local bourse.

Muscat Securities Market has achieved a turnover of OMR2.1 billion in the first eleven months of 2014, which works out to a daily turnover of OMR9.4 million.

The acquisition of Bank Muscat's brokerage business may enable Gulf Baader to become the number one brokerage house in terms of market share.

The decision to sell brokerage business is due to an ongoing review of strategic alternatives and operational priorities, Bank Muscat said in a disclosure statement posted on MSM website.

""The Bank Muscat brokerage will cease to operate from February 10, 2015. All brokerage customers are being notified and suitable processes are in place to facilitate a smooth migration,"" added the statement.

However, the transaction value was not disclosed by Bank Muscat and Gulf Baader Capital Markets.

""The acquisition has been made as part of GBCM's strategy to further reinforce its dominant position in the institutional and corporate brokerage business and strengthen its position in the retail brokerage business,"" said Gulf Baader Capital Markets in a separate disclosure statement.

""The company has received the necessary approval from Capital Market Authority for this acquisition and the process of opening of brokerage accounts of erstwhile customers of Bank Muscat is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015.""

Almost all banks, barring HSBC Bank Oman, Bank Sohar and two Islamic banks, have brokerage business. Brokerage volumes have shown a tremendous growth since 2013, compared to the previous year.

According to sources, the market leader in brokerage business is United Securities, followed by Gulf Baader Capital Markets, Global Financial Securities, EFG Hermes Oman, Bank Muscat and Oman Arab Bank, which have a combined share of over 60 per cent.

New York Post Tuesday 30th December, 2014

Given the choice of spending New Year’s Eve with Hillary Clinton, Gov. Andrew Cuomo or Mayor Bill de Blasio, most voters in New York state would pick ';none of them.';

The former secretary of state and probable 2016 presidential candidate was chosen by 37 percent of those surveyed by Quinnipiac University between Dec. 13 and 21.

The governor and mayor didn’t break double digits– each was selected by 8 percent of voters.

The big winner in the poll was ';none of them'; at 45 percent.

';Would you like to toast the event with the man in the Governor's Mansion? Very few say yes. The man in Gracie Mansion? Not too many takers for that either,'; said Maurice Carroll, assistant poll director.

Among Democrats, Clinton hit 52 percent compared to de Blasio’s 12 percent and Cuomo’s 8 percent.

Not surprisingly, Republicans overwhelmingly rebuffed the trio — with 71 percent saying they’d enjoy celebrating New Years more without Bill, Andrew or Hillary around.

The poll surveyed nearly 1,300 New York voters.

In 2011, the most recent year for which statistics are available, heart disease claimed the lives of more than 308,000 men and 288,000 women in the United States, while cancer killed more than 302,000 men and 274,000 women.



The cancer report estimates there will be more than 1,658,000 new cancer cases and over 589,000 cancer deaths in the United States in 2015 -- about 1,600 cancer-related deaths a day.



However, those numbers are still a significant improvement on the past: The report found that cancer death rates declined from about 215 per every 100,000 people in 1991 to about 169 per 100,000 in 2011.



Convincing Americans to quit smoking has been the major driver in reducing cancer deaths, Jemal said. The number of smokers has been cut in half, and now represents fewer than one of every five people in the United States.



As a result, the lung cancer death rates dropped 36 percent between 1990 and 2011 among males, and 11 percent between 2002 and 2011 among females.



Increased use of early detection tools -- such as mammography, colonoscopy and cervical exams -- has also had a tremendous impact on the war against cancer, Jemal said.



Gains for men slightly exceeded those for women. Between 2007 and 2011, the average annual decline in cancer death rates was larger for men (1.8 percent) than women (1.4 percent), the report found.



Jemal also noted that during the past two decades, deaths from colon and prostate cancer have been nearly cut in half, and breast cancer deaths have dropped by a third.



""Really, it's due to screening, as well as improved treatment,"" he said. ""It's really remarkable.""



Progress varied by geographic region, however. The smallest declines in cancer deaths generally occurred in the South, where drops were about 15 percent. The biggest advances took place in Northeastern states, with the cancer death rate dropping 25 percent to 30 percent in Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New York and Delaware.



States that made less progress in fighting cancer likely have large populations of people who are poor or uninsured, which means they don't have access to the kind of health care that can detect or prevent cancer, Jemal believes.



In addition, these states often have policies that hamper cancer prevention -- for example, cigarette taxes may be too low to discourage smoking. ""If you look at the southern states, their excise taxes on tobacco are the lowest in the nation,"" Jemal said.



The overall rate of cancer cases (incidence) remained stable for women between 2007 and 2011, but declined by 1.8 percent per year for men.



Men experienced relatively rapid declines in cases of colon cancer (3.6 percent per year), lung cancer (3 percent per year) and prostate cancer (2.1 percent per year) during that period, the report found.



But there's been no change in incidence rates for breast cancer. And the report found that certain cancers are even on the rise. For example, thyroid cancer cases increased an average 4.5 percent per year between 2007 and 2011, and liver cancer cases have increased by more than 3 percent.



The increase in liver cancer cases is largely due to hepatitis C infection, mainly through intravenous drug use and sharing needles in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Jemal said.



The rise in thyroid cancer cases cannot be easily explained, Jemal said. Some suspect the condition may be now overdiagnosed due to the overuse of imaging scans and ultrasound, he said, but there's also been an increase in the size of cancerous lesions found.



""For thyroid, it's very difficult to explain what's occurring,"" he said.

Progress in the war against cancer has triggered a 22 percent drop in U.S. deaths over the past two decades, translating to about 1.5 million lives saved, a new American Cancer Society report finds."

198|Storm brings snow, cold to West for New Year's|"A blustery winter storm dumped snow and ice across the West on Wednesday, making driving treacherous in the mountains from California to the Rockies and forcing residents and partygoers in some usually sun-soaked cities to bundle up for a frosty New Year's.

Giddy residents in Southern California foothills snapped photos of snow-covered lawns as kids tossed snowballs. In suburban Phoenix, swimming pools and cactus-lined back yards were dusted with the white stuff.

Those planning to usher in 2015 along the Las Vegas Strip or watch flower-decorated floats in the Rose Parade in Pasadena, Calif., were bracing for near-freezing temperatures.

Marco Berri, 26, of Brazil said he would likely buy some scarves and gloves to keep warm in Las Vegas, but the cold wouldn't keep him inside.

""We're going to be in the street. It doesn't matter how cold it is,"" said Berri, one of about 340,000 revelers expected to pack the Strip and the downtown Fremont area on New Year's Eve.

The storm swept from California into the Mojave Desert and Las Vegas, bringing snow to parts of northern Arizona and New Mexico along the way.

Gusting winds toppled trees throughout California, killing at least three people in the state in recent days."
199|PDP claims support of 55 legislators|"Jammu : PDP president Mehbooba Mufti told Jammu and Kashmir Governor N.N. Vohra Wednesday that her party had the support of 55 legislators in the 87-seat assembly to form a stable government.

Mehbooba Mufti did not specify if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with 25 legislators, was supporting her but made a pointed laudatory reference to former prime minister and now ailing BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader met the governor for about 90 minutes at the Raj Bhavan in this winter capital, official sources told IANS.

Mehbooba Mufti later told the media: ""We have the support of 55 MLAs. It is our intention that a stable government is formed to address the huge problems faced by the people in the state.

""We want that the agenda of development and peace should be carried forward. We want Atal Bihari Vajpayee's peace process (with Pakistan) to be carried to its logical conclusion,"" she added.

She, however, did not specify if a PDP-BJP alliance will take office in the state although most pundits believe that will be the case.

The PDP and BJP together command 53 legislators. The BJP won all its seats in the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the PDP won all but two seats in the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley.

It was not clear which two other legislators propose to back the PDP-BJP government. The People's Conference of former militant Sajad Lone has two members in the house and he had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The National Conference, which was voted out in the election, won 15 seats and the Congress, its estranged ally, 12. Seven seats went to independents and smaller parties including two to Lone's party.

Amid the political uncertainty that followed the hung verdict, the BJP held discussions with the National Conference but there was opposition to partnering with the BJP within the National Conference.

Vohra sent separate letters to the PDP and the BJP for discussions on government formation.

BJP general secretary Ram Madhav called on Vohra Tuesday along with state party president Jugul Kishore."

201|Yemen Suicide Bombing At Cultural Center Leaves Dozens Dead|"

(Updates death toll, changes source)

SANAA, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 26 people in central Yemen on Wednesday when he blew himself up at a cultural center where students were celebrating the Prophet Mohammad's birthday, a security official said.

At least 48 people were also wounded, including many women and children, the official said, according to state news agency Saba. The celebration, in the city of Ibb, was organized by the Houthis, the Shi'ite Muslim group that controls most of Yemen.

No one claimed responsibility for attack, but similar bombings have been carried out by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which operates in Yemen and regards Shi'ites as heretics.

Tensions have increased in Yemen since the Houthis captured the capital Sanaa in September and expanded south and west. The Western-allied country, which shares a long border with the world's top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had been trying to overcome an al Qaeda threat before the Houthi advance.

The official said the bomber mingled with guests as they arrived at the cultural center and detonated his suicide belt at the back of the hall.

The official told Saba that all local government officials escaped unharmed, except for the director of the culture department, who suffered serious injuries.

A local resident had earlier said the director general of the Ibb governorate was among the dead.

President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, in a condolence message to the Ibb governor and families of the victims, condemned ""the terrorist and criminal"" attack and instructed the government to ensure the wounded receive full medical attention, Saba said.

Residents reported a second explosion occurred outside one of the two hospitals, al-Thawra. But security sources later said that security forces had been firing in the air to disperse residents who had gathered in front of the hospital.

202|35 killed, 46 injured in Shanghai stampede - MyNorthwest|"SHANGHAI (AP) -- Thirty-five people died in a stampede during New Year's celebrations in Shanghai's historic waterfront area, city officials said Thursday -- the worst disaster to hit one of China's showcase cities in recent years.

A Shanghai government statement said another 46 people were receiving hospital treatment, including 14 who were seriously injured, following the chaos about a half-hour before midnight.

The microblog of the People's Daily, which is run by the ruling Communist Party, said that 25 women and 10 men had died, aged between 36 and 16. The injured included 3 Taiwanese and one Malaysian, it said.

The official Xinhua News Agency quoted an unnamed witness as saying people had scrambled for coupons that looked like dollar bills that were being thrown out of a third-floor window. It said the cause of the stampede was still under investigation.

At one of the hospitals where the injured were being treated, police brought photos out of dead victims who they had not been able to identify, causing dozens of waiting relatives to crowd around the table. Not everyone could see, and young women who looked at photographs someone had taken on a cellphone broke into tears.

A saleswoman in her 20s, who refused to give her name, said she had been celebrating the New Year with three friends. ""I heard people screaming, someone fell, people shouted 'don't rush,'"" she said, adding she could not reach one of her friends. ""There were so many people and I couldn't stand properly.""

Xinhua said the deaths and injuries occurred at Chen Yi Square, which is in Shanghai's popular riverfront Bund area, an avenue lined with art deco buildings from the 1920s and 1930s when Shanghai was home to international banks and trading houses. The area is often jammed with spectators for major events.

On Thursday morning, dozens of police officers were in the area and tourists continued to wander by the square, a small patch of grass dominated by a statue of Chen Yi, the city's first Communist mayor.

Police stood guard at Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital, where many of the injured were being treated. Earlier, relatives desperately seeking information had tried to push past guards at a hospital, state media photos showed. Guards had to use a bench to hold them back. Later, police were allowing family members into the hospital.

People who couldn't contact friends or family members went to the hospital. A man, who gave only his surname, Wu, said he had traveled to Shanghai from a province in the south, Jiangxi, Thursday morning to look for his 23-year-old friend. She had gone to Shanghai to celebrate on the Bund with another friend, but one of their phones was powered off and the other had been lost and handed in to police, Wu said.

CCTV America, the U.S. version of state broadcaster China Central Television, posted video of Shanghai streets after the stampede, showing piles of discarded shoes amid the debris.

One photo from the scene shared by Xinhua showed at least one person doing chest compressions on a shirtless man while several other people lay on the ground nearby, amid debris. Another photo showed the area ringed by police.

Steps lead down from the square to a road across from several buildings.

""We were down the stairs and wanted to move up and those who were upstairs wanted to move down, so we were pushed down by the people coming from upstairs,"" an injured man told Shanghai TV. ""All those trying to move up fell down on the stairs.""

Last week, the English-language Shanghai Daily reported that the annual New Year's Eve countdown on the Bund that normally attracts about 300,000 people had been cancelled, apparently because of crowd control issues. The report said a ""toned-down"" version of the event would be held instead but that it would not be open to the public.

The stampede appeared to be near that area.

""Some people have fallen,"" Shanghai police soon warned on Weibo, a Twitter-like service, and they urged people to obey police and leave the scene without pushing.

The Shanghai city government released photos online showing the mayor hurrying into a local hospital to visit victims.

Meanwhile, Xinhua's top story on its website was not the stampede but President Xi Jinping's New Year's message. Xinhua's story in Chinese remained just two paragraphs long hours after the disaster.

The China Daily newspaper in February reported that the city's population was more than 24 million at the end of 2013.

Man booked on 7th-offense DWI in Ascension Parish

State Police arrested a Denham Springs man early Tuesday morning in Ascension Parish on seventh-offense DWI.

A motorist called police about 2 a.m. Tuesday to report an erratic driver heading west on Interstate 10 past La. 641, said Trooper First Class Jared Sandifer, a State Police spokesman. Police pulled over Efremzimbalist Randle, 46, when he exited onto La. 73 and made an illegal U-turn.

Randle failed a sobriety test and blew above the legal limit on a Breathalyzer, Sandifer said.

Randle was booked into the Ascension Parish jail on counts of seventh-offense DWI, reckless operation, possession of alcoholic beverages in motor vehicles, disobeying a police officer, operating a vehicle with a suspended license and an ignition interlock device violation."
204|Mars Rover Opportunity suffers flash memory problems, but NASA has a fix|"US space agency NASA has said that its Mars Opportunity rover, which has been exploring the Martian surface since ten years, has developed severe memory problems.

According to the team behind the Opportunity project, the robot keeps resetting itself on regular intervals and it is due to an age-related glitch that is affecting its flash memory.

Revealing more about the problem that the rover is facing, NASA project manager John Callas said, “We are calling the problem as ‘amnesia,’ as the rover is trying to use the flash memory. It stores telemetry data in that volatile memory, but when the rover goes to sleep and wakes up again, all (the data) is gone. So that’s it’s amnesia or the memory problem.”

“The problems started off fairly benign, but now they’ve become more serious — much like an illness, the symptoms were mild, but now with the progression of time, things have become more serious,” Callas said.

Callas said that the problem makes rover stop whatever it was doing in the past as it’s unsure what caused the reset. This is interrupting NASA’s science mission on the surface of the Red Planet, he underlined.

According to Callas, they now require to hack the systems of Opportunity Rover in order to find a solution to this amnesia problem.

Callas said that his team has probably found a way to hack into the software of Opportunity and fix the glitch.

According to NASA, the team feels that the solution to the glitch is probably a couple of weeks away from actual implementation. This is because the age of the robot may be approaching to the end.

“Hence, we’re always cautious that something could happen,” Callas said.

The American space agency still has the Curiousity rover on the Red Planet following its launch in 2011 which is searching for life on the martian surface."

206|Plans for Capitol Expansion|"Changes are in the works at the State Capitol.

""The building will remain the same. It's historic, it's been restored, and it's on the National Historic Registry,"" said John Truscott with the michigan Capitol Commission.

But behind the building is where they hope to add an expansion.

""We'll also have a Welcome Center, entrance off Walnut where visitors, mainly school kids, will walk up a hallway to an area that opens up to a be a true Welcome Center with a committee room, cafeteria, education center, things like that,"" said Truscott.

Right now the Capitol West Lawn is a parking lot. But by fall of 2017, The Capitol Commission hopes to turn all of this back into a park with a new Welcome Center and parking lots underground.

""There's a lot of damage and repairs that need to be done. It's very costly. So if we can take some of the people to another part of the building... it'll take a lot of pressure and cost out of maintaining the building,"" said Truscott.

It's all part of a plan from 25 years ago. This phase could cost around 88 million dollars.

""We're doing a lot of underground digging out and building, so it is quite expensive,"" explained Truscott. ""But long term it'll save us money in repair costs of the building.""

The Commission plans to finance it through the Michigan Strategic Fund.

""It'll be tax payer resources that pay it off, but right now they're paying a building fund that goes to maintaining the building,"" said Truscott. ""So some of that will likely be peeled off.""

He says the changes will increase security.

""This'll add a secure entrance for people. It'll give people a place to go should there be an incident in the building, and we'll have cameras everywhere,"" he said.

Changes to keep both staff and visitors safe.

The Michigan Capitol Commission plans to have the money to move ahead with construction by next spring.

They plan on hiring The Christman Company because it's worked on other projects in the building."

208|Supermarkets launch New Year petrol price war|"THREE major UK supermarkets are ushering in 2015 by cutting petrol and diesel prices.

Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda have all said they would reduce prices by 2p per litre from today.

Since September, fuel prices fallen a number of times at forecourts across the country.

The cuts will see Asda customers, for example, pay no more than 107.7p a litre for petrol, with diesel at 114.7p a litre.

With world oil prices plunging, this is Asda’s 13th cut since the end of September, taking in total 19p a litre off petrol and 15p a litre off diesel.

Asda’s petrol trading director, Andy Peake, said: “We’re pleased to be giving drivers some early new year savings.”

Avishai Moor, Sainsbury’s head of fuel, said: “This is another way in which we can offer our customers real value for money when they fill up on New Year’s Day.”

The AA said supermarkets were responding to competition and a fall in wholesale fuel prices.

Spokesman Luke Bosdet added that the latest reductions were “in line with wholesale price falls”.

He went on: “The UK average price for petrol is currently around 113p per litre.

“However, just how far it falls is anyone’s bet. Current indications are that the magical £1-per-litre average price across the UK is still looking unlikely in the short term.”

Supermarkets have been responding to price pressures from independent petrol retailers, he added.

Crude oil trading prices have also fallen dramatically. On Monday, the average pump price for unleaded petrol hit 113.7p per litre, its lowest since March 2010.

Meanwhile, Asda’s chief executive Andy Clarke has admitted 2015 could be challenging for a number of supermarkets, warning he had never seen profitability fall so quickly in the UK supermarket sector. He said discount supermarkets have had a striking impact on retailing.

“The level of profitability decline in some retailers over the course of 2014 – we’ve never seen it before,” said Mr Clarke.

Analysts Kantar Worldpanel say discount stores Aldi and Lidl have reached a record combined market share of 8.6 per cent of all shopping at major UK grocery chains. Their rise has come at the expense of the “Big Four” supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.

Supermarket expert and Loyalty magazine editor Annich McIntosh described the changes to the supermarket sector as “profound”. She said: “There are a lot of very worried executives of food stores out there. This modern shopper is unlike any we’ve known before – a person with a mobile phone who can compare prices instantly.”

Mark Price, however, the managing director of Waitrose, said he was more positive about the year ahead. He said discounters were not having an impact on Waitrose sales.

209|Karabagh Court Sentences Azerbaijani Saboteurs, Baku Denounces Trial|"STEPANAKERT (A.W.)—The Trial of two Azerbaijani saboteurs, Dilham Askerov and Shahbaz Guliyev, concluded on Dec. 29, with a life sentence for Askerov and 22 years in prison for Guliyev. The two were charged and convicted of not only illegally crossing the border into Karabagh but also the kidnapping and murder of 17-year-old Smbat Tsakanyan.

The two men were accompanied by a third intruder, Hasan Hasanov, as they crossed the border on June 29, armed with weapons and ammunition. Hasanov was later killed during a struggle with the Armenian Armed Forces as the soldiers attempted to capture the saboteurs.

The men were reportedly sent as spies by Baku to carry out espionage and to gather information. On July 4, they kidnapped Tsakanyan and later murdered him, leaving his body in a forest within the Shahumyan region. Tsakanyan’s father, Mekhak Tsakanyan, reported his son missing on July 7 after searching the village for days. Smbat Tsakanyan’s body was found with multiple gunshot wounds present.

The three saboteurs then attacked and killed Sargis Abrahamyan and severely wounded Karine Davtyan on the Vardenis-Karvachar Highway on July 11. The Armenian Armed forces attempted to arrest the trio, but Hasanov resisted arrest and was neutralized while his co-conspirators were detained and tried.

The Azerbaijani government has denounced the trial, demanding the release of the two men. Baku claims the two men had a right to visit Karabagh, as they say it belongs to Azerbaijan.

“This so called court process conducted in Azerbaijan’s occupied territories has no legal basis, and the result claimed cannot have any legal weight,” Hikmet Hajiyev, spokesperson for the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying. “Dilgam Asgarov and Shahbaz Guliyev were taken hostage by the Armenian Armed Forces as they were visiting the graves of their parents in the territory of Azerbaijan, and Hasan Hasanov was killed mercilessly. Armenia is responsible for grossly violating the European Convention on Human Rights, international humanitarian law, the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and for taking civilians hostage, interrogating them through torture and forcing them to face illegal trial,” he said, adding that Azerbaijan would work through the OSCE to secure the release of the two men."
210|Nigeria: Elechi Presents 2015 Budget Amid Tension At State Assembly|"Abakaliki — Govenror Martin Elechi of Ebonyi State Tuesday presented a budget estimate of N80,017,929,870 for 2015 fiscal year.

The budget tagged Budget of Transition of Fulfillment was lower than the downward revised budget of N85,634, 933,972 for 2014 fiscal year.

However, the presentation was delayed as Governor Elechi, his Deputy, Dave Umahi along with members of the state executive council were stranded at the Assembly premises following their inability to enter the building.

The budget presentation, which was to start by 12:00pm was delayed till 3:00pm due to speculations that the budget may be rejected by members of the House, resulting from the lingering crisis that has rocked the Assembly for the past five months.

The governor after waiting for about 30 minutes at the Assembly premises waiting for the House to be opened was later received by the speaker and other members. He then held a close door meeting with the House members that lasted more than three hours before entering the chamber.

He stated that in the 2015 fiscal year, the recurrent expenditure will gulp N39,991,977,780 representing 47.48 percentage while the capital expenditure is N42,025,952,090 representing 52.52 percentage of the total budget.

According to the estimate, economic sector receives N24,022,394,920 taking the largest chunk of the capital provision while education sub sector receives N2,077,015,000 and Health sector N2,147,100,000.

The governor said that the N16.5 billion bond collected by the state government in 2010 was never intended to complete the projects embarked upon and urged members of the House to ensure that justice is done to the budget as it will help government complete its projects.

Earlier, the speaker of the House Rt. Hon. Chukwuma Nwazunku while addressing the governor and members of the executive council among other stakeholders of the state denied any plan by the House to hold the state to ransom by delaying the 2015 budget.

Meanwhile, the speaker has set up a seven-man committee to oversee the budget, just as he assured the governor of its speedy passage in the interest of the people of the state."

10. Tony Blair says Israel will not be able to destroy Hamas

In July, while the war between Israel and Hamas was blaring, former prime minister Tony Blair, who is now the representative of the Quartet of Mideast Peacemakers, said that Israel would not be able to destroy Hamas as a political movement and that such a move would have to come from the Palestinian people themselves.

“…what I do know is that will only happen if it happens within the context of a way forward, particularly for the people of Gaza, that gives them some hope for the future, because in the end a political movement like that has support on the ground, and you need to shift ... take away that support,” said Blair in an exclusive interview with Ynet.

9. The good life of senior Hamas officials

While Palestinians were evacuating their homes and moving into crowded UN shelters during the summer Gaza war, Ynet reported that Hamas senior officials were living a life of luxury in Qatar – viewing Television coverage of the fighting will working out on elliptical bicycles. The report juxtaposed the realities of the average Palestinian in Gaza and the Hamas leaders – an angering picture showing the disparity between the lives of elite Hamas officials and the poor Gaza civilian.

6. Foreign journalists admit threats by Hamas impacted their war coverage

A day after the summer war between Hamas and Israel ended, foreign journalists who left Gaza finally mustered up the courage to report what they had been too scared to shed light on while they were reporting from within Gaza: Hamas had staged bomb scenes, shot rockets 50 meters away from the hotels of foreign journalists and the Hamas headquarters was based in a civilian hospital.

5. Haredi men refuse to sit next to woman on El Al flight

Some passengers onboard the flight traveling from New York’s JFK to Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport said that the haredi travelers offered to pay them to switch seats so they would not have to sit next to woman. After travelers refused to change seats, the haredi men stood in the aisle in protest and delayed the flight.

4. Hollywood stands behind Israel during Gaza war

After Penelope Cruze and Javier Bardem publicly expressed their harsh criticism of Israel, the pro-Israel Hollywood community responded with a petition that said that Hamas “cannot be allowed to rain rockets on Israeli cities, nor…hold its own people hostage,” which was signed by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Seth Rogan, Sarah Silverman and Aaron Sorkin.

Former finance minister and head of Yesh Atid said that Israel-US relations had reached a boiling point and that Israeli officials must show more respect to the country that provided Israel with technology and funding that were critical during Operation Protective Edge. The criticism was indirectly geared toward Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, who had called Kerry “messianic” and “obsessive” in closed door meetings.

1. German village plays hilarious prank on Neo-Nazis

Fed up with an annual visit by neo-Nazi demonstrators who invade the village of Wunsiedel in South Germany every November to commemorate the National Heroes’ Remembrance Day by visiting the grave of Adolf Hitler’s Deputy, the community members took a new approach to their protest of the event and created an ironic prank which included putting up banners that stood in the backdrop of the march, mocking the neo-Nazi’s.

Banners that read “Mein Mampf!” (My food) were put up along the path of the march and mocked Hitler’s autobiographical novel Mein Kampf. To top it all off – for every meter marched by the neo-Nazi’s, 10 euro was raised for an NGO that supports neo-Nazis who leave the sect.

215|Bodies from AirAsia plane arrive in Indonesia|"PANGKALAN BUN/SURABAYA - The first two bodies from the AirAsia plane that crashed off the coast of Borneo arrived on Wednesday in the Indonesian city of Surabaya, where relatives have gathered to await news of their loved ones.

Rescuers believe they have found the plane on the sea floor off Borneo, after sonar detected a large, dark object beneath waters near where debris and bodies were found on the surface.

Ships and planes had been scouring the Java Sea for Flight QZ8501 since Sunday, when it lost contact during bad weather about 40 minutes into its flight from Surabaya to Singapore.

Seven bodies have been recovered from the sea, some fully clothed, which could indicate the Airbus A320-200 was intact when it hit the water. That would support a theory that it suffered an aerodynamic stall.

Tatang Zaenudin, an official with Indonesia's search and rescue agency, said earlier that one of the bodies had been found wearing a life jacket.

But he later said no victim had been recovered with a life jacket on.

""We found a body at 8.20 a.m. and a life jacket at 10.32 a.m. so there was a time difference. This is the latest information we have,"" he told Reuters.

Two bodies, in coffins bedecked with flowers and marked 001 and 002, arrived by an air force plane in Surabaya.

Most of the 162 people on board were Indonesians. No survivors have been found.

HUNT FOR ""BLACK BOX""

Hernanto, of the search and rescue agency in Surabaya, said rescuers believed they had found the plane on the sea bed with a sonar scan in water 30-50 metres (100-165 feet) deep.

The black box flight data and cockpit voice recorder have yet to be found.

Authorities in Surabaya were making preparations to receive and identify bodies, including arranging 130 ambulances to take victims to a police hospital and collecting DNA from relatives.

""We are praying it is the plane so the evacuation can be done quickly,"" Hernanto said.

Strong wind and waves hampered the search and with visibility at less than a kilometre (half a mile), the air operation was called off in the afternoon.

""The weather today was really challenging in the field, with waves up to 5 metres high, wind reaching 40 km per hour (and) heavy rain, especially in the search area,"" Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo, the head of the search and rescue agency, told reporters in Surabaya.

He added that the plane's whereabouts had not yet been confirmed and so the search for it would continue.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo said his priority was retrieving the bodies.

Relatives, many of whom collapsed in grief when they saw the first grim television pictures confirming their fears on Tuesday, held prayers at a crisis centre at Surabaya airport.

""UNBELIEVABLY"" STEEP CLIMB

The plane was travelling at 32,000 feet (9,753 metres) and had asked to fly at 38,000 feet to avoid bad weather. When air traffic controllers granted permission for a rise to 34,000 feet a few minutes later, they received no response.

The pilots did not issue a distress signal.

A source close to the probe into what happened said radar data appeared to show that the aircraft made an ""unbelievably"" steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the Airbus A320's limits.

""So far, the numbers taken by the radar are unbelievably high. This rate of climb is very high, too high. It appears to be beyond the performance envelope of the aircraft,"" he said.

The source, who declined to be named, added that more information was needed to come to a firm conclusion.

Online discussion among pilots has centred on unconfirmed secondary radar data from Malaysia that suggested the aircraft was climbing at a speed of 353 knots, about 100 knots too slow, and that it might have stalled.

The Indonesian captain, a former air force fighter pilot, had 6,100 flying hours under his belt and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, said the airline, which is 49 percent owned by Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia .

Three airline disasters involving Malaysian-affiliated carriers in less than a year have dented confidence in the country's aviation industry and spooked travellers.

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing in March on a trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew and has not been found. On July 17, the same airline's Flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.

On board Flight QZ8501 were 155 Indonesians, three South Koreans, and one person each from Singapore, Malaysia and Britain. The co-pilot was French.

The AirAsia group, including affiliates in Thailand, the Philippines and India, had not suffered a crash since its Malaysian budget operations began in 2002."
216|Aceh Bans New Year Celebrations|"Aceh police was ordered to confiscate fireworks or other such material for the festivities.

ACEH – The mayor of Indonesia’s Aceh province has issued a new directive banning New Year celebrations as contradicting with the Islamic teachings, a decision supported immediately by local authorities.

""[It[ is not a religious event, but just a profane and worldly event where people only enjoy the transfer of a new day with hurrahs,” Illiza Sa'aduddin Djamal, mayor of Banda Aceh said, Asia News reported on Tuesday, December 30.

“Cafés and night spots are told to stop their operation,"" she added.

Citing this reason, she has also forbidden all religious activities for contradicting with the “Muslim culture"".

Moreover, police was ordered to confiscate fireworks or other such material for the festivities.

""All events related to New Year celebrations are contrary to Islamic culture. Non-Muslim citizens of Banda Aceh will have to show respect,"" she said.

Follow News Zone on: Facebook Twitter

Similar fatwa was issued last year by Malaysian scholars who urged the government to cancel New Year’s Day celebrations which might cause Muslim youths to commit sins.

Muslim scholars in Saudi Arabia also voiced a similar call, warning that “punitive measures” will be taken against those who celebrate New Year’s Eve.

Muslim scholars in Aceh have also banned Christmas celebrations last year in the province.

In Banda Aceh, New Year’s is typically a time of celebration. Residents take to the streets, blowing trumpets and setting off fireworks before the start of the next year.

Aceh, located on the northern tip of Sumatra Island, is gradually implementing Shari`ah under a broad autonomy package granted by the central government in 2001 to pacify demands for independence.

It also has a religious police force whose task is overseeing Islamic regulations on dress, alcohol, gambling and immoral acts."

218|More than 130 stranded by snow in San Bernardino Mountains|"San Bernardino fire crews are preparing to rescue more than 130 motorists stranded in about a foot of snow, officials said late Tuesday.

UPDATE: Crews rescue 50 motorists trapped overnight on San Bernardino mountain road

The drivers were stuck on a section of Highway 138 that winds through the San Bernardino Mountains between Crestline and Silverwood Lake, said San Bernardino County Fire Department spokeswoman Tracey Martinez.

“Everyone is OK,” Martinez said. “But we need to get those people out of there as quickly as we can.”

Three snowcats were en route to carry the stranded motorists to a church, where ambulances will in turn transport them to a shelter, Martinez said.

Drivers across the San Bernardino Mountains encountered difficulty with the arrival of white powder, with the California Highway Patrol reporting calls of stranded motorists for much of the night.

The southbound 15 Freeway in Hesperia was closed just before 9 p.m. because of several cars stuck in the snow, said CalTrans spokeswoman Terri Kasinga.

Nearly all of State Route 38 -- from Forest Falls Boulevard in Forest Falls to Big Bear Dam -- was closed as vehicles became stranded in the snow.

Kasinga cautioned that drivers on the 15 Freeway should be prepared for traffic breaks and intermittent closures. Alternatively, she advised staying put, if possible.

“Tonight, I wouldn’t travel to the mountains,” Kasinga said. “Wait until tomorrow morning.”

The cold storm from Canada has brought heavy winds and several inches of snow across Southern California.

The National Weather Service forecast snow across the region to as low as 2,000 feet above sea level. The Antelope Valley and San Gabriel Mountains were expected to see a dusting, while higher elevations in Los Angeles County were expected to see up to 5 inches.

Strong winds were reported from Ventura down to the southern reaches of Orange County. Fremont Canyon in Orange County saw winds up to 57 mph, while Malibu Hills saw gusts up to 70 mph.

National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Martin said the strong winds would continue through Wednesday morning but drop off in the late afternoon.

The snow and light rain are expected to move out by late Wednesday.

“When things clear out, it should get colder,” Martin said.

The Antelope and San Luis Obispo valleys could see lows between 12 and 20 degrees Wednesday night, while the flats of Los Angeles and Ventura counties will see lows from the 20s and to the low 30s.

220|Uber didn't OK Chicago driver charged with assault|"CHICAGO (AP)  A Chicago driver accused of sexually assaulting an Uber passenger was not authorized to drive for the ride-sharing company and used an account created in his wife's name to pick up customers, the company said Wednesday.

San Francisco-based Uber has come under scrutiny over its driver screening process, including from prosecutors in California who filed a lawsuit in December accusing Uber of exaggerating how comprehensive its background checks are.

Uber said Maxime Fohounhedo was driving under an account created in his wife's name in violation of Uber's rules prohibiting account sharing. Prosecutors say he used his own photo and phone number on the account.

Uber spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin couldn't immediately explain how that discrepancy could have been missed during the application process or despite what she said were Uber's ""regular re-checks"" of driver photos.

""We do our best to send drivers though our background check process, which far exceeds what's expected of taxis,"" she said. ""But there is also a responsibility for the rider to make sure that when they get into an Uber that they're checking the license plate and they're checking the driver's face and making sure all that matches up.""

In this case, though, such scrutiny by the rider might not have helped because Fohounhedo's own photo would have showed up on the user's smartphone, Mullin acknowledged.

The Uber app allows smartphone users to search for rides from regular taxis, limos and private individuals such as Fohounhedo who use their own vehicles in an arrangement known as ride-sharing.

Fohounhedo was arrested Sunday and has been charged with sexual assault in an alleged attack in November. A judge ordered him held Tuesday in lieu of $500,000 bail.

The 22-year-old victim told police she was attacked between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. after being picked up from a bar.

Assistant State's Attorney Robert Mack said the woman was intoxicated and woke up on a couch at the driver's apartment with the man sexually assaulting her. Afterward, he told the victim, ""I made you happy,"" Mack said.

Public defender Sandra Bennewitz told reporters Fohounhedo ""has evidence that will support his claim that he did not do this and that whatever happened was consensual.""

Fohounhedo would not have been eligible to drive for Uber in Chicago, where regulations require ride-share applicants to have held a license for at least a year. Fohounhedo has only held a temporary Illinois visitor driver's license since August, according to the Illinois Secretary of State's office. His wife, however, has had a regular Illinois license since 2009.

Uber says its background checks screen would-be drivers against county, federal and multi-state records going back seven years.

It also cites records showing several hundred physical violence complaints against traditional taxi drivers in recent years in Chicago.

A public records search by The Associated Press found no evidence of a prior criminal record for Fohounhedo."
221|Local govts should set realistic target|"China's fiscal income will grow at low to medium pace, said Finance Minister Lou Jiwei, urging local governments to set their revenue target at a realistic level and promote a healthy development of the economy, reported the Economic Daily on Wednesday.

""The government can't raise tax or increase burden on companies in the time of a slowing economy,"" said Lou after a national fiscal conference.

Lou asked authorities to focus on transforming the economic structure and achieving a more balanced growth while implementing positive fiscal policies, according to the Daily.

""Local governments need to overcome the speed complex, treat the change of revenue growth in a matter-of-fact way, and boost a healthy benign interaction between public finance and the economy,"" said Lou.

He added that reform of the budget management has started since 2014 and the government will further expand its openness next year.

""Apart from classified information, all department involved with fiscal funding should disclose their budget and final statement,"" said Lou.

Financial priorities next year also include enhancing management on local government debts and solving the extending debts while strictly controlling new issuance, according to the Economic Daily."

Iran Condemns Terrorist Attack in Central Yemen

TEHRAN (FNA)- Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham strongly condemned the recent fatal attack on the residents of the city of Ibb in Central Yemen.

On Wednesday, an al-Qaeda suicide bomber killed at least 33 people in Central Yemen when he blew himself up at a cultural center.

Afkham reiterated that Iran deplores the terrorist attack on the civilians in Yemen, and further expressed sympathy with the bereaved families of the victims.

Afkham underlined the need for cooperation of all Yemeni political and social parties, groups and currents to implement the peace and partnership agreement in the Arab country, and said, ""The Yemeni people's vigilance will uproot the heinous phenomenon of terrorism in that country.""



Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham

According to the report at least 33 bodies, including women and children, were transferred to two hospitals in the city of Ibb.

The governor of Ibb province was reported to be among a number of people wounded in the attack, local residents said.

In a text message, the state Saba news agency cited the head of Ibb's police as saying three people had died and 30 had been wounded.

Residents reported there was a second explosion outside one of the two hospitals, al-Thawra. No details were immediately available or if there were casualties.

Al-Qaeda militants frequently carry out bomb attacks in Yemen and have been locked in deadly battles with Ansarullah fighters.

Al-Qaeda-linked violence against Yemeni security forces has been growing since February 2012, when President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi came to power in a one-man election backed by Saudi Arabia and the United States.

Yemen’s central government has so far failed to confront the terrorist threat. Shia Ansarullah fighters, however, have intervened to fill the vacuum and have driven al-Qaeda militants out of many areas in the country."
223|AirAsia jet searchers fight 'time and weather;' 7 dead found|"ASSOCIATED PRESS PANGKALAN BUN, Indonesia, Jan 1: Searchers were racing ""against time and weather"" Thursday to recover the dead from the crash of AirAsia Flight 8501, with a window of good conditions slammed shut by another onslaught of wind and heavy rain.



Seven bodies have been recovered from the jet, which crashed into the Java Sea on Sunday with 162 people aboard.



Search crews began finding wreckage and corpses Tuesday, but in the thick of Indonesia´s rainy season, the weather has frequently prevented helicopters and divers from operating while strong sea currents have kept debris moving.



While searchers had no success Thursday finding bodies as of late afternoon, authorities announced that they had identified one of the seven previously recovered bodies: flight attendant Hayati Lutfiah Hamid.



Singapore´s navy sent in an unmanned underwater vehicle capable of surveying the seabed to try to help pinpoint the wreckage and the all-important ""black boxes."" Indonesia is using a minesweeper and a private survey ship that specializes in sea mapping, while aircraft capable of detecting metal also were deployed.



We are ""focusing on finding the body of the plane,"" Indonesia air force spokesman Rear Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto told reporters. ""There was something like a dark shadow once seen from a plane, but it cannot yet be proven as wreckage.""



The seven bodies were recovered from an area off Borneo island, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the site where bodies were first spotted. Remains are being sent initially to Pangkalan Bun, the closest town, before being transported to Surabaya, Indonesia´s second-largest city, where Flight 8501 had taken off.



Choppy conditions had prevented divers from entering the water Wednesday, and helicopters were largely grounded, but 18 ships continued to survey the narrowed search area.



Sonar images have identified what appeared to be large parts of the plane.



""It´s possible the bodies are in the fuselage,"" said Vice Air Marshal Sunarbowo Sandi, search and rescue coordinator in Pangkalan Bun. ""So it´s a race now against time and weather.""



The longer the search takes, the more bodies will decompose and more debris will scatter.

A massive hunt for the victims of the jet resumed in the Java Sea on Wednesday, but wind, strong currents and high surf hampered recovery efforts as distraught family members anxiously waited to identify their loved ones. (AP)





It is still unclear what brought the plane down about halfway into its two-hour flight from Surabaya to Singapore. The jet´s last communication indicated the pilots were worried about bad weather. They sought permission to climb above threatening clouds but were denied because of heavy air traffic. Four minutes later, the airliner disappeared from the radar without issuing a distress signal.



The cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders, or black boxes, hold data that will help investigators determine the cause of the crash but have yet to be recovered. Items recovered so far include a life jacket, an emergency exit door, an inflatable slide, children´s shoes, a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food.



Officials have not announced the identities of the recovered bodies. Relatives have given blood for DNA tests and submitted photos of their loved ones, along with identifying information such as tattoos or birthmarks that could help make the process easier.



The long wait, with its starts and stops, has been frustrating for Sugiarti, 35. Her 40-year-old sister, Susiyah, was a nanny traveling to Singapore for a vacation with her employers and their 2-year-old daughter.



""I hope that they can find her body soon. I feel sorry for my sister because it has already been five days,"" she told reporters at a crisis center set up at a Surabaya police station. ""I am trying very hard to be patient.""

225|Malaysians bid 2014 goodbye and pray for a kinder year ahead|"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 31, 2014:

It was a year full of unprecedented challenges, but when it was time to bid it goodbye at the stroke of midnight, Malaysians ushered in 2015 determined to put the setbacks behind them and rebuild their hopes and dreams with renewed strength.

Unlike previous years where it was all about pomp and pageantry, the celebrations this time around were minute in comparison, with two major airline tragedies and an ongoing devastating flood a sobering reminder of what we had to go through.

Malaysians, however, still found enough will to usher in the New Year in their own special way, with many opting to spend it at home with loved ones or in prayer.

Some of the usual celebrations still went on though, albeit on a smaller scale.

In Kuala Lumpur, fireworks were seen illuminating some parts of the city, while in Penang, celebrations were also subdued.

The Rakyat Post readers, however, are hoping for a more positive new year, vowing to learn from an eventful 2014.

Rossiti Aishah Rashidi said with all the trials and tribulations faced, some lessons in 2014 had to be learnt to rectify mistakes made in the past year.

The first step, she said, was for the people in power and elected leaders to serve the rakyat honestly and with integrity.

“As long as we/they don’t realise the mistakes, and are always suspicious and not respecting of what the other side is doing, then how can we make the right move for next year?” Rossiti asked under the comments section when The Rakyat Post quizzed readers on what they expected this new year.

She also hoped for a kinder, respectful and more environmentally conscious year.

A reader, who only wanted to be known as Navinraj, said the events in 2014 had become a platform for many pertinent issues to be discussed, not only by lawmakers, but by all Malaysians as well.

“The main thing is the mindset of Malaysians itself. We have to progress mentally to allow progress to manifest physically,” the 24-year-old student said when contacted.

Navinraj aimed to better himself in this new year, based on the experiences he had accumulated last year, which he admitted was a trying one.

As for Kok Meng, 2014 was a year when lots of tears were shed due to grief and anger.

“Hope 2015 will bring us all closer together where we continue to help one another,” she wrote, adding that her own resolution for the year would be “respect”.

She called on Malaysians to learn to respect one another and co-exist as well as to bear in mind that the nation had gone through so much together.

“We still need each other to weather through the challenges ahead.”

When contacted, Dhevein Pillaii said he could not wait to graduate from university this new year and start being independent.

“I just want to get over my degree and start helping to support my family.”

Aside from his degree, the 24-year-old also plans on saving up money to restore his father’s car, which was handed down to him.

“It’s a Mercedes Benz 200 W123. I want to see it brand new, just as how it was when my father bought it.”"

They don't seem to be the best of friends while in Los Angeles (after all, she was married to his good pal Brad Pitt). But down in Mexico, they appear to be besties.

Us Weekly has reported that George Clooney had Jennifer Aniston over for dinner at his house inside the exclusive El Dorado gated community in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico on Sunday.

Other guests included the Friends star's fiance Justin Theroux and Clooney's new wife Amal Alamuddin as well as their friends Jimmy Kimmel, Emily Blunt, John Krasinski and Howard Stern.

An insider told the publication that '[Jennifer and George] brought Jimmy, Howard and John and their wives.'

The source added, 'George's chef cooked for everyone and they had a ton of wine and tequila. They stayed for hours and didn't get back to their house until very late.' No doubt the Ocean's Eleven actor's Casamigos Tequila was on hand.

And while everyone was celebrating and having a good time, the 45-year-old Cake actress discussed a little bit of business with George.

Circle of friends: Emily Blunt and John Krasinski were also invited to the star-studded soiree

Party with pals: Jimmy Kimmel, wife Molly McNearney, Howard Stern and wife Beth Ostrosky were also in attendance

'They are talking about making a movie in Cabo,' the source continued. 'Jennifer is really excited about it and wants to do it.'

On Monday, the former Friends star was seen enjoying the warm rays with her 43-year-old actor fiance Justin and all the married couples minus George and Amal.

For the last few years, Jennifer and her A-list pals have been retreating to Cabo San Lucas around New Year's Eve. It was also the same place she vacationed with ex-husband Pitt in 2002.

George also vacations in Cabo every year with his buddies, but this year was the first time as a married man.

The Monuments Men star has been spending the holidays in Mexico with his barrister spouse Amal just two months after the couple's romantic wedding in Italy.

The newlyweds joined the actor's BFF Rande Gerber and his model wife Cindy Crawford and have been spotted enjoying each other's company since December 23.

228|CDC: Flu at epidemic level; 15 children dead this season|"CDC: Flu at epidemic level; 15 children dead this season

News Channel 4 Thursday 1st January, 2015

(CNN) — The United States has officially surpassed the ';epidemic'; threshold with this season’s flu virus, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC estimates that nearly 7% of all deaths nationwide were due to pneumonia and influenza during the week ending December 20 — the last week for which the agency has compiled figures on the outbreak.

Influenza is now ';widespread'; in 36 states, the agency said Tuesday.

Nationwide, a total of 15 children have died so far this flu season, including one in the third week of December.

Flu-related hospitalizations among people 65 years and older has reached 38.3 per 100,000 people, the highest rate of any age group.

The CDC recommends vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older, for as long as the flu virus is circulating. The agency has warned, however, that this year’s flu strain has mutated in ways that make the vaccine less effective than experts initially hoped.

Researchers say the timing of flu season is difficult to anticipate, but flu activity generally peaks in the U.S. between December and February, and seasonal flu activity can persist as late as May.

229|In new downtown building, seniors live under the thumb of a strict manager|"Under the rules, residents of Campbell Landings apartments must carry their dogs outside in strollers or a bag, never in their arms. Failure to do so could result in a legal notice to get rid of their pet within seven days.

The temperature in each apartment must be kept at 78 degrees or lower. And the tenants, all low-income seniors, are told to clean any messes in the common-area bathroom with supplies under the sink. If it's deemed to be too dirty by the manager, she will lock it.

If someone's shoes make black marks on the hall floors, that person must clean them.

Potential rule-breakers are warned that there are cameras all around, and a ""building watch committee"" made up of hand-picked tenants will be looking for any missteps. As for the 10 smokers in the nonsmoking building, someone on each floor is assigned to monitor them. The rest of the residents, however, are repeatedly admonished for gossiping.

This 96-unit building is in St. Petersburg. The one in Florida, not Soviet-era Russia.

Part of a building boom that is bringing thousands of new residents to downtown, Campbell Landings sits just blocks from Bayfront Medical Center, at 365 6th St. S.

But behind the brightly lit sitting areas, the pot-luck parties, the community courtyard and other amenities, the manager rules with an emphasis on keeping the building clean — and with page-long memos in call capital letters and regular threats of eviction.

""I've been bullied, intimidated, watched by people,"" said Tere Van Diest, a 66-year-old resident who loves her apartment but not the management. ""I've never encountered anything like this. I have rented homes and apartments for more than 20 years.""

Manager Patty Fuentes could not be reached for comment. Several residents interviewed Wednesday said they had no problem with her management style.

One of the building's owners, however, said some of her memos and the watch committee are extremely inappropriate. He was told about the situation after the Tampa Bay Times inquired about conditions in the building.

""We don't want a building managed that way. This is troubling to have that going on in what I think is a great building and a real success,"" said Bowen Arnold, a managing member of DDA Development, the property's owner and developer. ""As the owner, we don't approve or sanction any of that. We want it to be run properly and we want people to feel comfortable with the management, not bullied.""

Fuentes and her husband, who is the Campbell Landings maintenance manager, are employees of NDC Real Estate Management, a Pittsburgh-based company that manages 9,000 rental units in eight states.

""I've worked with this management company for 20 years. They have a great reputation,"" Arnold said. ""I'm going to address this with (Fuentes') boss and with the senior management, and we are going to take appropriate measures.""

Campbell Landings is home to about 130 residents who pay rent starting at about $280 a month. The developer was awarded federal tax credits to sell to investors to offset building costs and offer below-market rental rates.

At least two residents are working with Gulfcoast Legal Services, which offers free aid to income-eligible residents, in hopes of getting their leases renewed. They recently were told they would have to move, but they said they weren't given a reason. Gulfcoast attorney John Herbst said the tone in the manager's memos isn't unusual at senior housing properties.

""I've seen this before. Management ends up on a power trip. They treat (senior residents) like kindergartners in lassos,"" he said. ""(Seniors) shouldn't have to put up with a lot of the stuff they put up with.""

The manager ""got mad one time and took the TV remote from the common area for about a month,"" said Chris von Obenauer. ""She treats us like we are her employees, and we're always in trouble.""

To save money, von Obenauer turns her air conditioning off or up high when she is out of the building. She said she often comes home to find her air on or turned down lower. Several residents said tenants on the watch committee have keys to apartments or common rooms.

Four other residents who were interviewed said they have no problems with the management and feel comfortable among a friendly group of neighbors.

""I love my apartment and I love my friends. There are a lot of rules, but that's okay,"" said Brenda Hart, 65.

After they moved in, residents were asked to sign a mold addendum to their leases. Among other things, they had to agree to avoid air drying dishes, not hang wet clothes to dry inside, keep closet doors ajar and water house plants outside the building, which doesn't have balconies.

Although the mold rules might seem demanding, they are common as a preventative measure at many other apartment complexes in the Tampa Bay area and around the country. Campbell Landings does not have mold problems, Arnold said.

Even as some residents complain about the building's management, they say they still like living there because they couldn't afford such a quality apartment and great location any other way.

""Some people just blow off all the memos and rules because they say, 'I don't want to get in trouble complaining,' "" Van Diest said. ""That's typical of older people.""

230|Left turn could cost UK's Labor the 2015 election, says ex-PM Blair|"Ed Miliband, leader of Britain's opposition, has damaged his chances of winning next May's national election by steering his Labour party too far to the left, former Labor prime minister Tony Blair said on Wednesday.

The criticism from one of Labor's most successful leaders highlights policy divisions within the party and doubts over Miliband's ability to win a close-fought election race against Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron.

In an interview with The Economist magazine, Blair warned that the election could be one ""in which a traditional left-wing party competes with a traditional right-wing party, with the traditional result"".

Asked if he meant that the Conservatives would win, he said: ""Yes, that is what happens."""
231|Geekdom Fund raises nearly $3 million for tech startups|"SAN ANTONIO - U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's attorneys will present evidence Friday during the second day of a hearing to determine whether the Army sergeant should face a military trial for leaving his post in Afghanistan, although they aren't saying if Bergdahl himself will be called as a witness.

The hearing for Bergdahl, who is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, is taking place at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, where he has been stationed since returning to the U.S. last year.

Officials say the Taliban captured Bergdahl after he left his post in 2009, and he remained a prisoner for five years before being released in exchange for five Taliban commanders being held at the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The prisoner swap was sharply criticized by many Republicans and some Democrats, who said it was politically motivated and counter to the U.S. policy against negotiating with terrorists.

Lead attorney, Eugene Fidell on Thursday said he would call four witnesses, though he declined to say if Bergdahl would be among them. He also repeated his call for the military to make public Bergdahl's interview with military investigators after his return to the U.S., saying it would help tell Bergdahl's side of the story and also counteract the negative publicity Bergdahl has faced since his return.

Prosecutors on Thursday didn't mention the criticism that has surrounded Bergdahl since his return but focused on trying to substantiate the misbehavior charge. That charge, which carries a possible life sentence, would require them to prove that Bergdahl's actions put other soldiers in harm's way. If convicted, Bergdahl also could be dishonorably discharged, reduced in rank and made to forfeit all pay.

The prosecution's three witnesses - commanders of Bergdahl's platoon, company and battalion - testified Thursday that his disappearance from his post in Afghanistan put a strain on their forces and put his fellow soldiers in danger.

His company commander, Maj. Silvino Silvino, said some of the thousands of soldiers who took part in the search were angry about it because they felt Bergdahl had deserted. Military prosecutor Maj. Margaret Kurz said Thursday that Bergdahl had actually been planning for weeks to abandon the post.

Finally, Bergdahl's battalion commander, Col. Clinton Baker, said that although no soldiers died as part of the search, there was a spike in improvised explosive device attacks because soldiers were going to places they ordinarily would have avoided.

Bergdahl, wearing his blue and black dress uniform, spent much of Thursday's hearing taking notes and conferring with his attorneys.

The hearing will result in a report that will be forwarded to Gen. Robert Abrams, the commanding general of U.S. Army Forces Command. Abrams will decide whether the case should be referred to a court-martial or be resolved in another manner."

233|Fuselage of Missing AirAsia Plane Found at Bottom of Java Sea|"MOSCOW, December 31 (Sputnik) — Indonesian search and rescue officials are believed to have honed in on the remains of the missing AirAsia Flight QZ8501 plane, with sonar imaging showing the fuselage, lying upside down, at the bottom of the Java Sea.

A relative of one of the passengers briefed by search and rescue officials told CNN on Wednesday that sonar had ""spotted the plane on [the] sea floor.""

The plane is said to be in the Karimata Strait, in the Java Sea off the coast of Borneo, lying at a depth of 24-30 meters (78-98 feet). The first debris had earlier been spotted on Tuesday.

Commenting on the grisly discovery, Indonesian President Joko Widodo noted that now is the time to show strength in ""this difficult moment,"" and stated that he has ""instructed all the teams to focus on finding the passengers and crew.""

AirAsia chief Tony Fernandes told media at a press conference that the discovery ""absolutely devastated"" him, and that ""this is a scar with me for the rest of my life."" He added that ""there is some closure [now] as opposed to not knowing what's happened and holding out hope.""

In addition to searching for passengers and crew, search workers are expected to look for the plane's black boxes, which in addition to the sonar images is expected to help them determine the cause of the accident. Reuters explained that three meter high waves and heavy winds have stalled the search on Wednesday.

Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency Chief Bambang Soelistyo noted that six bodies have been pulled from the water, one of them appearing to be a uniformed flight attendant, the BBC reported. This negates earlier reports by a navy official that up to 40 bodies were pulled from the water.

AirAsia QZ8501 went missing on Sunday with 162 passengers on board, most of them Indonesian nationals. The Airbus A320-200 flight was traveling from Surabaya, Indonesia to Singapore, vanishing in bad weather.

Reuters explained that one of the main theories is that the plane suffered an aerodynamic stall before plunging into the water. Online discussions by aviation experts reveal that Malaysian radar data shows that the plane may have been climbing at too slow a rate, resulting in the stall. The crew had sought clearance to increase their altitude in order to avoid bad weather shortly before all contact with the plane was lost.

The plane had undergone regular maintenance in November, and had an experienced pilot with 6,100 hours of flight time.

AirAsia is a Malaysian low-cost airliner operating international flights to 100 destinations across 22 countries. This is the third Malaysia-affiliated plane to go missing in 2014. In March a Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board. In July, MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people onboard.

30 ships and 21 aircraft from Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and the United States have been participating in the search for QZ8501. No survivors have been found."
234|Young Ottawa family to take over historic Opinicon Resort|"The historic Opinicon Resort was owned by the same family for 93 years, and in January that tradition will change when a young family in Ottawa takes possession of the property.

“I don’t think that their intentions are to do any kind of major demolition. My impression is they’re more likely to do restoration, renovation and to operate the resort in some fashion,” Manson Slik, a broker and partner at Gordon’s Estate Services Ltd. who was responsible for the sale.

The starting bid for the resort was $500,000 for the 6.5 hectares of land with accommodations for more than 120 guests. The property also came with a dining room to serve the entire resort, a full commercial kitchen, 15 cottages, three houses, a general store and more than 240 meters of waterfront along the Opinicon Lake.

The origins of the resort dates back to the early 19th century, when the Chaffey family used it as their home. In 1921, it became a resort and facilities have been maintained over the years.

“Everything is still the old original wood,” Slik said, “Over the last few years, less and less people have come there because it feels like 100 years old.”

After the death of their mother, sisters Karen Cross and Cindy Simpson decided to sell the resort in February 2012. The family who purchased the home on Dec. 18 wish to remain anonymous. Slik said he expects they’ll maintain the oldness of the place but will modernize its amenities.

The resort is about an hour-and-a-half from southwest Ottawa and can be accessed by boat along the Rideau Canal. It was one of the oldest resorts in Eastern Ontario that attracted fisherman and elites who would dock their pleasure boats and have a bite to eat in the well-known restaurant along the canal.

“The place still has 50 or 60 different fish all over the resort that different people have caught and every fish has a story. It’s a fascinating place to visit,” Slik said.

The deal closes in January, and Slik said he thinks that will give the new owners enough time to do some renovations and at least partially open by the summer."

238|SD Veterans Reflect On War In Afghanistan|"SIOUX FALLS, SD -

The longest war in American history ends Wednesday with the conclusion of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan following 13 years of war.

A total of 1727 servicemen and women served in Afghanistan from the South Dakota Army and Air National Guard, according to Major Anthony Deiss, spokesman at the South Dakota National Guard’s Camp Rapid headquarters. One paid the ultimate sacrifice; specialist Dennis G. Jensen of Sioux Falls died at age 21 on August 16, 2011 in a non-combat accident in southern Afghanistan. He is buried with full military honors in the Sturgis National Cemetery.

Deiss called the Guard “very fortunate” to not have suffered more losses.

Sergeant First Class Matthew Tjaden of the Sioux Falls area served in Afghanistan from February to September 2014 with the Army National Guard.

“It was tough, but worth it,” Tjaden said. “Everything that we did was worth the time that we spent there in my opinion.”

13,500 soldiers will remain in Afghanistan in support. As of Wednesday, none are from the South Dakota Army or Air National Guard, according to Deiss.

Joshua Baer of Freeman served in Afghanistan with the Army National Guard from February to December 2013. Loyalty and tradition motivated his service.

""My grandpa was a World War II veteran,” he said. “I have a number of cousins who have also served in multiple deployments, so it's just kind of continuing on our history.""

Tjaden also spoke of loyalty when discussing his fellow servicemen and women’s time in Afghanistan.

""They went and did their jobs as they were told to, and we all came home safe and made a great impression… with other, with active duty units, from my experience,"" Tjaden said.

Mark Jensen of the Sioux Falls area served in Afghanistan with the Army National Guard from 2010 to 2011. He spoke about displaying the ""South Dakota hospitality a little bit.""

""A lot of people put in a lot of extra time …with humanitarian aid stuff, getting stuff sent over, and taking it out on missions with them, and helping with school supplies, clothing. I know people in our unit designed alternate fuel sources.""

The service went beyond combat.

""Kind of just helped with their everyday living besides our normal mission over there,"" Jensen said.

2,224 Americans gave their lives in the war in Afghanistan, according to the Associated Press."
239|2014 Year In Review: Colorado 200 – Shuffling The Middle Of The Deck|"Colorado’s legal market is transforming from the middle. This year’s Colorado 200 list indicated as much about the local market.

The largest firms in the state remained stable in the past year, loping along on course. The small firms mostly maintained their positions as well. Mid-sized firms, however, appeared to exist in a volatile market filled with mergers and dissolutions and plenty of ups and downs. Despite the volatility, Colorado’s legal market is not unique, with large firms around the country remaining mostly steady, or stagnant, and medium firms scrambling in efforts to scale up.

Colorado’s largest firms remained steadfast in the past year, with the top 10 from 2013 matching the top 10 in 2014. The only shakeup on the list was the reversal in order between Faegre Baker Daniels and Bryan Cave, though both firms dropped a few attorneys. The rock solid top 10 showed that rumors of BigLaw’s demise might be exaggerated. Not only did the top 10 firms fall in nearly the exact order as last year, but the number of attorneys at each firm has stayed level as well. Seven of the top 10 stayed within five attorneys of their size last year.

Holland & Hart, however, which remained at No. 1 on the list, saw substantial growth for the second year in a row, adding seven attorneys between 2012 and 2013 and adding 21 attorneys between 2013 and 2014. According to the Georgetown Law Center for the Study of the Legal Profession 2014 Report on the State of the Legal Market, the stable condition of large law firms is not isolated to Colorado’s powerhouses. According to the report, 2014was a “flat year” for economic growth.

240|Heightened south-west road safety focus for 2015|"A 41 per cent increase in south-west Victoria’s provisional road toll to 17 deaths for 2014 has put a sharper focus on safety campaigns for the new year.

A 41 per cent increase in south-west Victoria’s provisional road toll to 17 deaths for 2014 has put a sharper focus on safety campaigns for the new year.

Most of the deaths were on rural and popular tourist routes including one which claimed three lives at Broadwater after a tree fell across a road during a windy, winter’s night.

Two people died after a bus crashed into a railing on the Great Ocean Road near Princetown and two died at Strathdownie when their car ran off the road and hit a tree.

Although the number of crashes involving serious injury remained static at 126 for the past two years, alarmingly 54 per cent involved vehicles running off the road.

Three fatalities in Glenelg Shire and three in Corangamite Shire involved vehicles running off the roadway plus one in Southern Grampians.

Hoon driving continued to be a big factor in police bookings with an 87 per cent rise in the number of offenders’ vehicles seized and impounded.

Regional superintendent Don Downes, of Warrnambool, said there was too much complacency among drivers on rural roads.

He cited fatigue, speed, alcohol, drugs and distractions as major issues.

“People think it won’t happen to them,” he said.

“It’s very important, especially when travelling long distances to rest if tired and plan ahead.

“More people were killed on country roads than the previous year — we don’t want a repeat for 2015.

“It needs a whole of community effort.”

Superintendent Downes said electronic devices in modern vehicles could be a distraction if drivers did not concentrate on the task ahead.

“With GPS devices, warning beeps, heads-up displays and so forth there’s a lot more going on in a car than vehicles 15 years ago,” he said.

“Drivers need to rest and revive to survive.

“Rural driving is a lot different to metropolitan roads — there are a lot of big trees that can cause significant injury or death if you hit them.”

Superintendent Downes noted there had been no south-west fatalities since Operation Summerstay started in November which entailed police targeting high-risk areas and times.

“The community seems to have needed warning and advice,” he said. “We’ll run that operation through until the Australia Day weekend.”

He said the increase in hoon impoundments from 69 in 2013 to 75 in 2014 came as police powers were strengthened to tackle that category of irresponsible driving.

Offenders faced fines and costs of more than $2000, he warned.

Victoria’s provisional road toll late yesterday stood at 248 compared with 243 for 2013.

The south-west figures are: Corangamite Shire: six males, one female (three drivers, two passengers, one motorcyclist, one pedestrian); Glenelg Shire: four males, one female (four drivers, one passenger); Moyne Shire: three males, one female (one driver, two pedestrians, one passenger); Southern Grampians Shire: one male (driver).

241|Megabus involved in crash on Indiana Toll Road|"Photo shows the 2010 Van Hoover double-decker bus, owned by Megabus, which was traveling from Indianapolis to Chicago when it was involved in a chain reaction crash on the Indiana Toll Road Tuesday, Dec. 30, 2014. (Photo Provided/ISP)

LAKE COUNTY, Ind. (WLFI) — Another crash involving a Megabus occurred Tuesday on the Indiana Toll Road. Police said the bus was involved in a chain reaction crash when the driver failed to slow down/stop for traffic ahead.

Indiana State Police said a double-decker Megbus loaded with 80 passengers was traveling from Indianapolis to Chicago on Tuesday, Dec. 30. Around 1 p.m. near the Indianapolis Boulevard exit, traffic had stalled due to a fatal crash that occurred earlier on the highway.

ISP said the bus driver, Albert Jackson, 63, of Richton Park, Illinois, was headed west on the toll road in the center lane. Traffic up ahead was slowing down and stopping, but troopers said Jackson failed to stop and caused a chain reaction crash.

The Megabus hit a Honda Pilot, driven by 41-year-old Hoon Lee, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, which caused the Honda to be pushed out of the way. A van that was in front of the Honda was able to swerve out of the way and avoid being hit.

But the bus continued forward and hit a Kia causing it to spin out and hit the barrier wall. Troopers said the bus continued swerving after hitting the Kia and hit another vehicle, a Chevrolet Equinox driven by 29-year-old Melissa Bittner, of Chicago. The force of impact made the Equinox hit a Subaru Outback, driven by 40-year-old Martin Peacock, of Greenwood, Indiana.

The driver of the Kia, 68-year-old Moshe Greenselv, of Calgary, Alberta, Canada and his wife, 69-year-old Zipora Greenselv, were taken to North Lake Hospital in Gary with minor injuries. All other drivers and passengers on the bus were uninjured.

ISP said all vehicles involved in the crash had to be towed from the scene. All Megabus passengers were transferred to another bus and resumed their trip.

242|Benue APC Governorship Crisis Deepens As Parties Head To Court|"The crisis rocking the All Progressive Congress in Benue state has deepened, as some of the aspirants head to court to challenge the submission of Dr Samuel Ortom’s name as consensus candidate for next years governorship election.

The case filed by two of the five aspirants, who participated in the botched December 5 primary election, Mr Emmanuel Jime and Joseph Waku, is billed for hearing on January 7, 2015 at a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja.

They are seeking the court’s order to compel the party to conclude the primary election it started.

Four of the aspirants had jointly petitioned the party headquarters, alleging lack of level playing grounds and subsequent sidelining from the meeting where Mr Ortom was selected as a consensus candidate of the party.

The Jime campaign organisation said it resorted to the court after the petition jointly signed by its candidate and three others was not addressed by the party. The consensus candidate, however, says due process was followed in his selection.

Despite this claims, the party and some members are locked in counter accusations on the legality or otherwise of the emergence of its governorship candidate.

Some of the candidate in reacting to the claim by Doctor Samuel Ortom, are stuck to their guns, insisting that the botch December 5 primary must be concluded.

Notwithstanding the threat, the APC governorship candidate said he remained the best man for the job, identifying critical areas of socio-economic needs of the state that needed urgent attention.

With this internal division, the much anticipated challenge the APC promised to haul on the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, may be a mirage, as key actors in the opposition party are locked in the supremacy battle."

The original sample was drawn from respondents recruited by phone or mail survey methods. GfK provides Internet access to participants who don't already have it. With a probability basis and coverage of people who otherwise couldn't access the Internet, online surveys using KnowledgePanel are nationally representative.

Interviews were conducted in both English and Spanish.

As is done routinely in surveys, results were weighted, or adjusted, to ensure that responses accurately reflect the population's makeup by factors such as age, sex, race, education and phone use.

No more than 1 time in 20 should chance variations in the sample cause the results to vary by more than plus or minus 3.4 percentage points from the answers that would be obtained if all adults in the U.S. were polled.

There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions.

The poll had a cooperation rate of 48 percent.

249|Christine Cavanaugh, voice of ‘Babe,’ dies at 51|"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Christine Cavanaugh, a prolific voice actress whose characters included the titular character of “Babe,” has died. She was 51.

Cavanaugh’s sister Deionn Masock confirmed Tuesday that Cavanaugh died Dec. 22 at her home in Utah. An obituary notice was also published in Tuesday’s Los Angeles Times.

Masock says the cause of death isn’t known.

Cavanaugh lent her voice to many of the 1990s indelible cartoon characters, including Chuckie Finster in Nickelodeon’s “Rugrats,” Dexter on the Cartoon Network’s “Dexter’s Laboratory” and the live-action piglet of 1995’s “Babe.”

Cavanaugh retired from voice acting in 2001 and moved back to her native Utah.

In the LA Times notice, her family wrote that “in each role there was a part of her showing through that the ones who truly knew her could see.”"
250|Nova Star seeks cut in cost of cancellation security bond|"Officials for Nova Star Cruises are attempting to get a reduction in the bond used as security in the event of service cancellations.

One of the regulatory requirements before the service could begin advertising or selling tickets and operating last May was the posting of a $2-million bond. That money is held in trust, to be drawn upon in the event crossings are cancelled and customers’ money is to be refunded.

The Nova Scotia government paid the money for the bond when Nova Star Cruises was having difficulty getting the cash together.

A spokesman for Nova Star Cruises recently confirmed via email that the company is in negotiations to have the bond reduced to reflect passenger volume.

The “Federal Maritime Commission looks at historical data of previous bonds issued for similar vessels on the run as well as the proposed data” when setting the amount, said Sean Lewis.

Nova Star carried a total of 59,000 people between Yarmouth and Portland, Maine from May 15 to Oct. 13.

The ship remains docked in Shelburne while the company continues to pursue some kind of winter business to help offset operating costs and lease payments for the ship. Company officials have said that cold weather is not good for the maintenance of the ship so it would likely need to be moved somewhere warm even if a charter contract cannot be secured.

Provincial government officials and company representatives remain in talks about a contract for the 2015 season, although nothing has been finalized. The previous contract between the two parties expired when Nova Star Cruises used up all of the $21-million operating fund, originally intended to last seven years.

In mid-October, when the province announced it would be forwarding an additional $5 million to the company, Economic and Rural Development Minister Michel Samson said the government was hiring KPMG for $90,000 to perform an analysis of the business and look for ways to improve operations.

At the end of October, Samson said KPMG’s work would take a few weeks.

Despite regular update requests, there has been no additional information provided on the review process. A government spokeswoman said Tuesday there were no updates related to Nova Star.

Neither Samson nor Nova Star president Mark Amundsen were available Tuesday for comment."

SAN DIEGO (CNS) - Starting Wednesday night, Caltrans will ring in the new year by lighting the arches on the Cabrillo Bridge, where Laurel Street crosses over state Route 163.

The lighting was installed as part of a project between Caltrans and the city San Diego to strengthen the century-old structure in case of an earthquake. The bridge was built for the Panama-California Exposition.

""The work we are doing will help preserve this iconic structure for decades to come,"" Caltrans deputy district director Dennis Wilder said. ""The lighting will showcase the graceful arches of this impressive gateway to San Diego.""

The lighting will complement the nearby California Tower, another historical icon of Balboa Park that is lighted at night.

Work began on the seismic retrofit and rehabilitation project in September 2013. The exterior work to upgrade the decking and repair unsound concrete was completed in November.

Interior work included installation of vertical post tensioning rods, reinforcing column walls, replacing utilities and installing a catwalk for maintenance. A new storm drain system also was installed.

Work to complete the catwalk is expected to wrap up by March 2015."

254|Just ONE eviction notice of whopping 660 served in Dublin as it's revealed 7,000 are in arrears|"Just one council tenant was forced out of their home in the capital for failing to pay their rent - even though 660 eviction notices were served.

It has also emerged that 7,000 tenants in Dublin are in arrears of more than three months while four have paid no rent at all in over a year.

But they are unlikely to find themselves on the street as it appears Dublin City Council finds it almost impossible to evict them.

Up to November last, only one tenant had been removed from their home after court proceedings were taken over the long-term non-payment of rent.

The figures also show that of the 660 served with notices to vacate their homes, 320 have had previous evictions orders served on them.

The City Council has taken legal action against 211 tenants but because of the large amount of cases clogging up the system it could be many months before

they come to the district court.

The Council cannot be accused of putting people on the street as they say they give those in arrears every opportunity to try to make some kind of payment.

They are given three writing warnings and an official will phone them or call personally before an eviction order is served.

In a statement the Council said: “If they enter into an arrangement and adhere to it, no further action will be taken and the account will continue to be monitored.

“If they fail to make a genuine effort to repay the outstanding arrears a court date will be sought by our law department.”

Independent councillor Ruairí McGinley claimed that it appeared there is evidence of “chronic non-payment of rent” being tolerated by the council.

He told the Irish Times: “The council charges a social rent – €57 is the average weekly rent – it’s about 20% of market rents, and if people don’t pay it it’s an injustice to people who do pay.”

Meanwhile it has emerged that thousands of local authority houses are lying empty while the numbers of families on waiting lists for a home are growing.

Recent figures show that over 90,000 families and individuals are on social housing waiting lists.

As many as 4,000 houses, 3.2% of the total stock, are empty with around 75% of them awaiting repairs before they can be rented to a new tenant.

On average it takes over six months for these houses to be repaired but in some local authority areas it can take over a year.

Cork City Council is slowest with a gap of 47 weeks between when a tenant vacates a property and it being ready to let out again and another 15.8 weeks before the new tenant before the new tenant moved in."
255|These agents prevent disease. Why aren't we using them?|"The life cycle of a medical advance usually goes something like this: from discovery at the research bench and replication of findings, to translational research and clinical trials, to implementation. The bottleneck can be at any one of these stages, and often it is in the discovery one; we just haven’t yet found the thing that works.

But other times, we have – the intervention works, we have shown and confirmed that it works, and yet for some reason, it just hasn’t caught on.

In medicine, we talk a good deal about overuse and misuse of resources leading to waste. But once in a while, we face the opposite problem.

Here are three stories of amazing medical advances that remarkably have not spread.

Less sickling, less being sick

Sickle cell disease is a disorder in which hemoglobin – the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen to body tissues – has difficulty doing its job. It is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, affecting 70,000 to 80,000 people. Patients are vulnerable to repeat “pain crises” when red cells sickle, or distort their shape. These episodes are typically treated with fluids, painkillers, and, in severe cases, exchange transfusion, where patients receive working red blood cells and swap out the dysfunctional ones.

The only known cure is a bone marrow transplant – a very intricate and risky procedure and thus usually reserved for a select few. Yet for the many individuals who don’t undergo curative transplant, there is another excellent option. There exists a single medication that leads to significantly fewer hospitalizations, reduced pain crises, fewer episodes of acute chest syndrome (a painful complication when lung vessels become clogged with sickled cells), and even longer lifespans. If that’s not enough, this one medication has also been projected to save the United States 26 million dollars annually if used in every eligible patient.

That wonder drug is called hydroxyurea. It works by increasing what is known as hemoglobin F, which is actually the form of the molecule we have as fetuses. More production of this type of hemoglobin leads to less assembly of the damaged version, resulting in less cell sickling and better oxygen delivery.

The FDA approved hydroxyurea for sickle cell patients in 1998, and their decision was based on a powerful randomized trial showing that taking the drug nearly halved all complications in adult patients. Patients had fewer pain crises (2.5 per year compared to 4.5), longer times to first pain crisis (3 months compared to 1.5 months), fewer acute chest events (25 compared to 51), and fewer transfusions (48 versus 73). The drug was relatively well tolerated, with no “important adverse effects.” The main side effect to watch out for is decreased blood cell counts, which can be effectively monitored with regular blood draws.

A second prospective non-randomized study evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea and found that after eight years, all the above benefits were maintained. Moreover, the probability of 10-year survival was significantly longer for those treated (86% vs 65%), even though those taking the drug may have been sicker overall. The same bump in survival was seen for patients with variants of sickle cell disease combined with thalassemia. Because of these findings, hydroxyurea is currently recommended in patients with frequent pain episodes, vaso-occlusive events such as acute chest syndrome, or severe anemia. It is the sole effective disease-modifying therapy currently approved for sickle cell disease.

Despite these striking findings, since 1998 the drug has been astonishingly underused. In 2008, a panel convened by the NIH shone a spotlight on its gross underutilization. One study found that despite three quarters of physicians agreeing with recommendations on hydroxyurea use in adult patients, only 45% reported prescribing it for all their eligible patients. Pediatric sickle patients fared no better; in 2009, a survey of hundreds of pediatricians caring for sickle cell revealed that only 8% reported that at least half of their patients were on the medication. Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds said 30% or fewer of their patients were taking the drug.

So what is the hold up? Dr. Courtney Thornburg at Duke Children’s Hospital has a fantastic presentation available online on just this topic. Barriers to more widespread use exist from both doctor and patient vantage points, she points out. On the patient side, one study found that major barriers among non-users were beliefs that the drug wouldn’t work, general lack of awareness of what it is or that it even exists, and concerns about safety (“I was told that HU causes birth deformities”; “My concerns are that it could lead to cancer”). From the doctor’s perspective, major obstacles include concerns about patient adherence with taking the meds, following up with lab work to monitor for side effects, or remaining on contraception while taking the drug to prevent potential risk of birth defects.

Interestingly, one study found that black physicians prescribed hydroxyrurea at better rates than non-black physicians. Ninety-four percent of black versus 73% of white versus 40% of other race respondents thought that hydroxyurea was effective or very effective in sickle cell treatment. With the majority of sickle cell patients black, this finding may signal a possible role of racial divides between caregivers and patients contributing to worse outcomes.

Dr. Thornburg’s presentation called for clearly delineated guidelines and increased education to combat some of these obstacles. Hopefully the drug will soon be brought to the forefront of the doctor-patient interaction where it belongs.

The strange case of the vanishing vaccine

Anyone who lives in an endemic area knows to watch out for ticks. Lyme Disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, with approximately 300,000 cases each year. There is no vaccine to prevent it.

Except that there was, at one point. As Dr. Gregory Poland from the Mayo Clinic describes it, the rise and fall of the Lyme vaccine marks:

“...the first time in the modern era that an FDA-licensed vaccine in the United States was withdrawn because of low public demand and class action lawsuits, despite the context of a high background rate of disease and a continuing, if not increasing, significant public health burden of morbidity.”

The vaccine known as LYMErix was developed in 1998 by SmithKline Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline). A randomized, placebo-controlled study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found its efficacy to be 76% for symptomatic disease and 100% for asymptomatic disease after three doses. Though more people who received the vaccine experienced soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site in addition to broader symptoms such as fever or chills, the risk of these symptoms is common to all immunizations; and all self-resolved without treatment. Of particular note, there was no difference in joint symptoms between the vaccine and the placebo groups. Based on these outcomes, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the CDC gave a permissive recommendation for the use of LYMErix in people aged 15 to 70 who lived in Lyme endemic areas.

Yet within its first year of use, vaccine recipients began speaking out about perceived side effects. By and large the most common was arthritis, and their voices gained a national spotlight. “Vaccine victims” were covered extensively in the media and on the Lyme Disease Network, a non-profit citizen action group. In 1999, the manufacturer of the vaccine was faced with a class action lawsuit.

Were these effects really due to the vaccine? It was an extremely important question worth studying. Fortunately, we had the data to do so.

In the beginning stages of vaccine administration, doctors reported all adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). By 2001, over 1,400,000 doses of the vaccine were distributed, and the VAERS database listed 905 adverse events. Joint pain was the most common (with 250 reports), and there were 59 reports of arthritis. However, when the data was examined further, it was found that just as many vaccine recipients reported arthritis as those in a comparison of unvaccinated people. There was also no increase in arthritis after the second and third doses of the vaccine, which would be expected if it were causative.

In 2001, after examining all the evidence and hearing testimonies from those affected, a panel convened by the FDA decided that there was no evidence that the vaccine was responsible for joint symptoms. For continued safety, they required the manufacturer to collect more data through its ongoing phase IV clinical trial[1].

But every day publicity took a hit, with the power of public mistrust gaining traction against the power of what the data actually showed. In the face of class action lawsuits, decreasing sales, and diminishing doctor support, the manufacturer finally decided to withdraw the vaccine from the market. Moreover, the public backlash against SmithKline Beecham was a big reason why competing manufacturer Pasteur Mérieux Connaught decided not to push forward with their own Lyme vaccine – even after it had already demonstrated efficacy in phase III clinical trials.

Sadly, the vaccine never made a comeback. According to Dr. Polack: “Since 2002, there has been no active, sustained interest in developing or licensing a Lyme disease vaccine in the United States.” A few have spoken out against the absurdity of this, including Dr. Stanley Plotkin in a 2013 op-ed in the New York Times.

Yet as we enter 2015, we remain essentially where we were before 1998.

If breast cancer runs in your family, you might want to ask about this

Did you know there is a medication to help prevent breast cancer in high-risk patients?

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, are better known for their use in breast cancer treatment. But now these drugs, which operate by interacting with estrogen receptors in breast tissue, have been shown to work for primary prevention, too.

In 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that doctors should offer tamoxifene or raloxifene to women at increased risk. It is a Grade B recommendation, meaning there is “high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.”

The idea that SERMs could prevent cancer was sparked by the finding that women who received treatment for cancer in one breast also had lower rates of cancer development in the non-affected breast. A large randomized trial known as the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial was initiated in 1992 to test the hypothesis. The outcomes on over 13,000 women were impressive: five years of tamoxifen treatment reduced the relative risk of developing invasive breast cancer by 49% and non-invasive breast cancer by 50%. In absolute terms, this meant average annual rates of breast cancer were 3.43 per 1000 women in the tamoxifen group, compared to 6.76 per 1000 in the placebo group. Over 5 years, the absolute risk decreased from 2.6% for 1.3%. Moreover, women with a history of a type of precancerous condition known as atypical hyperplasia showed an 86% reduced relative risk – an absolute decrease from 10.11 cancers per 1000 women to 1.43.

Was this too good to be true? Use of tamoxifen did not come without risk: as it works by interacting with estrogen receptors, it can also affect tissues outside the breast. One of these susceptible tissues is the endometrium of the uterus. The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (with a risk ratio of 2.53) and occurred mainly in women over 50. Still, all endometrial cancers were stage I (localized disease), and no endometrial cancer deaths occurred. A second adverse event was increased risk of blood clots, which also occurred mainly in women over 50. However, despite the increased relative risk, the absolute risk remained quite small.

But what if we could use another SERM that interacts more exclusively with breast tissue? Another large randomized trial focused on tamoxifen’s sister drug raloxifene, and found that 5 years of treatment reduces invasive breast cancer risk in high-risk women by about 38 percent. Here, raloxifene was statistically as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer – and it came with significantly less risk of endometrial cancer and blood clots. A longer-term analysis confirmed the reduced risk for at least 5 years after treatment as well.

As a result, both tamoxifen and raloxifene were approved by the FDA in 1998 for the primary prevention of breast cancer. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the USPSTF discuss their role in certain high-risk populations, including those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations who do not undergo prophylactic mastectomy, women over 35 with a personal history of certain pre-cancerous breast lesions, women between 35 and 59 who meet a certain risk score, and women over 60[2]. The bottom line is that while the risk-benefit calculation varies for individual women, the conversation should absolutely be had.

Yet in spite of the recommendations, the use of SERMs for prevention has remained staggeringly low in practice. Among 50,884 women in the Sister Study, where participants had at least one sister diagnosed with breast cancer, only 2% (1,046) reported ever taking tamoxifen for prevention. Overall, in 2005 0.08% of US women were found to be on tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention. And the US is not alone; one 2011 study in Australia found that less than 3% of 3788 high-risk women had used SERMs for prevention.

In an excellent cover story of HemeOnc Today, several experts weighed in on why this may be the case. A major barrier could be reluctance to prescribe or take a medication with potential side effects when the patient is otherwise healthy. With the exception of vaccinations, the act of intervening to prevent future illness is actually still quite unique in the medical world. When someone is ill, it is easier to swallow starting a medication. When a person appears totally healthy, however, starting something with potential adverse effects – even when the absolute risk of those adverse effects is small – is a harder sell.

A recent perspective piece by Wickerham and Vogel, however, is hopeful the lag can be improved by attacking it on several fronts. The National Cancer Institute can take a lead in promotion on both doctor and patient fronts, they argue; professional organizations can develop training for the next generation of residents and fellows; and breast cancer advocacy groups can push even harder for this underused, effective course of action.

Last year, Dr. Atul Gawande published a fantastic piece in The New Yorker called “Slow Ideas.” His premise was simple: why do some innovations in medicine spread, while others are slower to catch on?

I’d recommend reading the whole thing. But some highlights include recognizing that ideas spread more slowly when the problems are more invisible, along with realizing how change is fundamentally a social process.

“Simple ‘awareness’ isn’t going to solve anything,” Gawande asserts, and I agree.

Here’s to the start of something more.

257|Mabohanday Donates PPES to Health Ministry|"FREETOWN - As Sierra Leone starts the 42-day countdown to being declared Ebola-free, the national Red Cross is using mobile radios to remind people about Ebola prevention.

Isha Wilson-Clarke stands outside in the Mountain Cut community on the east of Freetown. She tells residents to avoid body contact of any kind. And remember to always call 117, the emergency hotline, if you're experiencing vomiting, high fever or other possible Ebola symptoms, she says.

What makes this awareness campaign unique is that these skits are broadcast on mobile radios that the Red Cross provides to communities.

Taking questions from the audience while people in other communities listen in, Wilson-Clarke explains the interactive nature of the tool.

""This radio in a box is a participatory drama, not only do we act for them, but we need the voice of the people. We communicate with them and ask them what they understand.""

Sierra Leone discharged its last confirmed Ebola case on September 27. The country must now go 42 days with no cases before the World Health Organization can declare it Ebola-free.

Broadcasting officer for the Red Cross Edward Aloushious Renner says the mobile radio project keeps people talking about Ebola so they don't get complacent.

""It's something that excites them and they want to tell their stories. It's an easy way of getting stories from the people,"" he says.

He says the performances teach people that an ambulance does not mean a death sentence.

At the peak of the crisis, people saw patients going into ambulances and never coming out and many are still afraid.

Watching the Red Cross performance in Mountain Cut, resident Zainab Kanu says the skit is especially good for parents with young kids, like her, who may have been reluctant to call 117.

The Red Cross plans to expand the program throughout Freetown.

The latest Ebola outbreak has killed 4,000 people in Sierra Leone, and more than 11,000 people across West Africa."

259|Three Florida counties to end courthouse weddings to avoid gay marriages|"JACKSONVILLE, FLA. — Couples who wanted to skip the pomp and circumstance of a wedding and get married at the Duval, Clay or Baker county courthouses will no longer have that option in the new year.

These counties’ decision to end the long-standing tradition of courthouse weddings is due, at least in part, to the continued debate over same-sex marriage in Florida against the backdrop of conservative Christianity. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle could rule any day and make gay marriage legal across the state.

If same-sex marriage is allowed across the state, Duval Clerk of Courts Ronnie Fussell, Clay Clerk Tara Green and Baker Clerk Stacie Harvey will have no choice but to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. But to avoid performing ceremonies for them, these clerks have decided to end all courthouse weddings.

All said multiple factors contributed to the decision to end courthouse weddings, with gay marriage being just one of them. And they said the new policies will take effect no matter what the courts decide about gay marriage.

Fussell says the decision came after a series of discussion with members of his staff who currently officiate wedding ceremonies. None of them, including Fussell, felt comfortable doing gay weddings so they decided to end the practice all together.

“It was decided as a team, as an office, this would be what we do so that there wouldn’t be any discrimination,” Fussell said. “The easiest way is to not do them at all.”

Equality Florida co-founder and chief executive Nadine Smith was shocked to hear that certain counties would stop allowing courthouse wedding because of the possibility gay couples would want to use the service.

“I think it would be outrageous for clerks to change the rules simply because gay couples are getting married,” she said.

Smith, an advocate for gay and lesbian rights, predicted the policy change would backfire and be characterized as spiteful and mean.

There were 1,911 wedding ceremonies performed at the Duval County Courthouse in 2013, compared to 6,342 marriage licenses issued. About 330 Clay County couples are married at its courthouse each year, and Baker averages about 30.

Nassau County Clerk of Courts John Crawford has not responded to a request about any changes there.

The clerks of courts in St. Johns and Putnam counties said they will continue to offer courthouse weddings, even if gay marriage becomes legal.

“Everything will remain the same,” said George Lareau, St. Johns County’s chief deputy clerk of courts.

Putnam County Clerk of Courts Tim Smith said he will allow individual members of his staff who feel uncomfortable with gay marriage to decline to perform those ceremonies, but no one has said they will take him up on the offer.

“They still can have a marriage ceremony here, and one of our staff will not be in an uncomfortable position if that is their belief,” he said.

Only through Friday, couples can get married at the Duval County courthouse for $30 in addition to the $93.50 fee for a marriage license.

Last Valentine’s Day, Fussell personally officiated a mass wedding for 12 heterosexual couples in the courthouse rotunda. He waived the ceremony fee, gave each bride flowers and offered a cupcake reception.

With the possibility that he would be forced to include gay couples who wanted to participate this year, there will be no weddings under the dome or the in the “wedding arbor” room that is most often used for these ceremonies.

Residents of Baker, Clay and Duval counties who want to avoid usual wedding expenses will now have to find a minister or notary to perform the ceremony after they pick up their marriage license, but a place other than the courthouse.

Baker Clerk Harvey said the decision is as much about logistics as it is personal conviction. The room where about weddings are performed each year will now be used as space for people filling out paperwork related to domestic violence injunctions.

“I needed the space and our county we’re in the Bible Belt,” she said. “... If we’re made by the law to issue a gay marriage license (we will) do that, but we are not mandated to marry couples in our courthouse.”

Harvey said there are members of her staff who would be uncomfortable performing same-sex weddings and she did not want to force them. She said she doesn’t feel comfortable performing weddings at all, gay or straight, and hasn’t officiated a ceremony in years.

Justin Horan, general counsel for the Clay County clerk of courts, said the debate over gay marriage accelerated discussions on whether to end courthouse weddings.

“Really it just expedited our evaluation on whether to continue to offer marriage ceremonies,” he said. “We had been talking about it for several months now.”

In addition to ending weddings, the Clay courthouse will no longer allow residents applying for passports to take their photos there. Once a new web-based system launches, people also won’t be able to purchase foreclosed properties at the courthouse.

“We felt that it was appropriate for us to focus on other services that the clerk offers,” Horan said."
260|CBI calls on Government to focus on slashing the deficit|"The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) believes the government’s top priority in the New Year must be to cut the national deficit and preserve much-needed public services.



As part of its New Year message, the business lobby group said slashing the deficit to more manageable levels is a “must” for whichever Government takes power in 2015.



However, the CBI hailed the UK’s economic performance in 2014 which has put the nation in the strongest position of all G7 leading nations.



John Cridland, director general, CBI, is passionate about ensuring the UK remains a leading place to do business in 2015 whilst encouraging more young people into lasting employment.



“We must sustain the best launch pad for the UK economy and our young people,” said Cridland.



“Cementing Britain’s reputation in the world as one of the best places to do business has to be a top priority for 2015.

“Our economy is among those enjoying the fastest growth among the G7 nations, with 1.2 million jobs created this year and employment set to grow in every region of the UK in 2015.”



On the subject of public services, Mr Cridland insisted that the simplest cuts to public services had already been made and the only way to bridge the gap between government spending and income was to take crucial steps to avoid public services experiencing “decline through a thousand cuts”.



The CBI suggests integrating health and social care, and a significant increase in services available online.



In addition, Mr Cridland has spoken out about the UK’s education system, suggesting the current setup was leaving too many young people behind, calling for GCSEs to be replaced by a four-year learning plan between the ages of 14 and 18.



The CBI says tailored learning plans would result in every pupil continuing to learn maths and English as well as a variety of academic or vocational A levels, to be tested only once at 18."

Deseret News Thursday 1st January, 2015

Recently I rode my bike from Sandy to Draper, enjoying another balmy December day with near record temperatures. On this day the air was fairly clear, so I rode farther than I planned, knowing I would not be inhaling those deadly PM2.5 particles. As a physician, I was especially aware of those invisible specks of pollution that create inflammation in one’s organs, especially the heart, lung and brain.

Enjoying free associations while riding, my mind shifted from the toxins in our air to toxins in our water. I recalled the dog that had died from toxic algae in Utah Lake in October. While the dog’s death was tragic, it wasn't entirely unexpected. Just one year earlier, the EPA had warned in its monograph, ';Impacts of Climate Change on the Occurrence of Harmful Algal Blooms,'; that these harmful algal blooms would become more common as the planet warms.

Indeed, it wasn’t just that beautiful December day that was warm, but the fall had been warm. We set records for the warmest temperatures in Salt Lake City for a given date four times during the fall: once in September and three times in October (including the 77 degree warmest Halloween ever). For 2014, 11 daily record high temperatures were recorded while no record low temperatures were set. This occurred during a year that is on track for being the hottest ever recorded for the earth.

We only have to take notice and our senses tell us our climate is warmer. And the scientific evidence is clear th...

263|How strongly you lean left or right politically could say something about your health|"Ideally we could all find some middle ground politically and compromise on issues to help the public as a whole, but maybe polarization is actually good for our health.

New research suggests that people on one end or the other of the partisan scale actually phsysically exercise more (at least in Europe), according to the Huffington Post.

“Busy people at both ends of the political spectrum do not seem to have as much time for idleness,” writes a research team led by Adrian Bauman of the University of Sydney’s School of Public Health. Based on the results, centrists do more sitting, “both on the fence and elsewhere.”

Bauman’s study, published in The BMJ, used data from the Eurobarometer, a survey conducted on behalf of the European Commission. Participants (with a mean age of 46) were from 32 European nations; all indicated their political orientation on a scale of one (far left wing) to 10 (far right wing). Advertisement All participants listed their “weekly minutes of vigorous intensity activity, moderate intensity activity, and walking,” the researchers note. “These scores were summed to estimate total physical activity.” A separate question asked them to estimate “total daily minutes of sitting time.”

Based on those reports, people on the far ends of the spectrum engaged in more physical activity that those in the middle (about an hour more each week).

“Centrists and the politically uncommitted may be at greater risk of non-communicable diseases because of their inertia,” Bauman and his colleagues warn. “The politically uncommitted and centrists could consider adopting a stronger political stance for their health.”

As the Huff Post points out, this information shouldn’t really be an incentive toward extremism, but it’s a fascinating finding."

KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 31 — Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth is still resilient despite the recent plunge in oil prices, and the country’s current account is unlikely to fall into deficit even if Brent crude oil drops to US$50 (RM174) per barrel . Pacific Mutual Fund Bhd chief investment officer Koh Huat Soon said although a number of sources posed headwinds to the economic growth going into 2015, the company believed the economy has sufficient resilience to withstand these stresses.

“As oil accounts for 30 per cent of the government’s revenue, there are fears that the government would miss its budget deficit target of three per cent in 2015 with dire consequences on its sovereign debt rating. “While a valid concern, Pacific Mutual is of the view that policy flexibility would be exercised in order to minimise the negative impact on government revenue,” Koh said in a statement here, today.

Pacific Mutual is an investment management company under the OCBC Group. Koh said the company believed that Petronas has the capacity to raise its dividend payout and scale back capital expenditure, with priorities of such cuts affecting projects abroad rather than domestic.

“Our advice to existing investors who invested in Malaysian equities is to hold on to their investments, so long as they are invested in undervalued companies, with sound balance sheets and competent management,” Koh said. He said these stocks would work out well in the long term as they would overcome short-term business challenges, irrespective of the sectors they are in. “We would even advise them to invest more in times of price weakness and the present time offers just that rare opportunity,” added Koh. — Bernama"
265|British parcel firm City Link axes over 2,300 jobs|"London (AFP) - The British parcel delivery firm City Link, which went into administration on Christmas Eve, announced on New Year's Eve that it would be cutting 2,356 jobs.

The company's administrators from Ernst & Young also said in a statement on Wednesday that 371 employees would be kept on to deal with remaining parcels, help sell off assets and wind down operations.

Dashing trade union hopes of a last-minute rescue bid, they also said a consortium wanting to buy the company had ""offered no money up front and significantly undervalued the assets to be acquired"".

The RMT union said the failure to secure jobs was ""a disgraceful and cynical betrayal"" and accused the company of ""leaving a trail of human misery"".

""The City Link Christmas destruction is an act of industrial vandalism that shames our nation while the government looked on and offered nothing but hollow words,"" said RMT general secretary Mick Cash.

The administrators said earlier that the company had been hit by intense competition on the postal delivery market, as well as changing client needs and difficulties in reducing its costs.

The announcement of the bankruptcy came on Christmas Day, prompting angry reactions from trade unions.

""This is the bitterest blow any group of workers could receive on Christmas Day,"" Cash said then.

""It is absolutely shocking that the company have sprung this announcement once all the Christmas deliveries have been completed,"" he said.

The company's website said it began delivering parcels in 1969 and had an annual turnover of Â£300 million (382 million euros, $467 million).

But Kelly said it had suffered ""substantial losses over several years"" and had ""all but used up"" a Â£40-million investment made in 2013.

The founder of City Link's parent company, Better Capital, has apologised for the firm's collapse but said it was ""not mishandled"".

Jon Moulton, a veteran venture capitalist, also defended the payment of redundancies through a taxpayer-funded scheme saying that City Link had ""paid a fortune"" in taxes."
266|How hearing loss affects your health|"Hearing aids do much more than simply amplify sound — they can substantially improve your quality of life and keep you mentally sharp.

While not many of us are in a hurry to have our hearing tested or purchase hearing aids, there are so many health benefits to be gained by treating hearing loss.

On average, a person that is having difficulty hearing waits seven years before doing anything about it. During that long period, they are missing out on many conversations. As well, an ear that hasn’t been stimulated due to untreated hearing loss can actually lose some of its ability to understand speech.

Untreated hearing loss can have a negative impact on relationships. Communication with family and friends can be very frustrating for both of you and lead to increased irritability, fatigue and stress.

People living with untreated hearing loss are more likely to report depression and anxiety and are less likely to participate in organized social activities than those who wear hearing aids.

So, why wait to have a hearing test?

At New Hope Hearing in Cambridge, Hearing Instrument Specialist Lisa Simmonds Taylor has seen what a difference it makes in her patient’s lives when they are able to hear better.

If you suspect your hearing sensitivity has dropped, have your hearing tested no matter what your age.

The consequences of undiagnosed or untreated hearing loss can include reduced job performance and earning power, reduced alertness and increased risk to personal safety and impaired memory.

Since hearing loss is usually such a gradual process, you may not fully realize how great an impact it is having on your daily life.

New Hope Hearing offers free hearing assessments. If you do have hearing loss, they will find the best solution for your individual needs to positively change your life.

267|Medicaid expansion is bad policy for Florida|"When I was 11 years old, I begged my parents for a dog. I'll feed it, clean up after it, walk it; you'll never have to do anything — FOR-E-VER. I promised, and at 11 years old, I sincerely meant it. Fast-forward three months: My dad was walking the dog, my mom was feeding it, and I had moved on to the next must-have (I think it was a skateboard).

Every time I hear someone discuss Medicaid expansion in Florida, I harken back to that promise I made and how disingenuous it ended up being. No matter how much I meant it at the time, reality proved otherwise. And with Medicaid expansion, no matter how much the federal government intends to make good on its promise to “pick up the tab,” the reality of the immense burden of $18 trillion of debt and countless trillions in unfunded liabilities will smack good intentions in the face.

The late U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is often quoted as saying, “You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.” This can be integrated into the debate on whether or not to expand Medicaid in Florida. Facts:

Florida's Medicaid reimbursement rates are a small fraction of the actual cost of providing health care services.

The result of these price controls is a shortage in the number of physicians accepting Medicaid patients.

The resulting shortage of Medicaid physicians means longer waits, diminished access, and reduced health care for the poor.

Medicaid accounts for approximately 30 percent of the State's budget (and growing).

Florida also faces a unique challenge in health care access — a significant and growing shortage of physicians. Facts:

Florida has less than 85 physicians per every 100,000 residents, substantially below the national average – ranking the State 30th in primary care physicians per capita.

Approximately 30 percent of Florida's doctors are older than 60 (5th highest percentage in the U.S.)

Florida stands to lose roughly one-third of our doctors to retirement by 2030.

Florida ranks 36th in medical school students per capita, even after doubling medical school enrollment from 2000 to 2010.

Now, we can shift from facts to opinion. The proponents of Medicaid expansion argue this is “free money.” This opinion is grounded in a misrepresentation of where Medicaid money comes from — taxpayers. Proponents of Medicaid expansion say the poor need a safety net and denying them access to Medicaid is akin to letting them suffer. This opinion distorts the history of terrible access to care and even poorer outcomes among Medicaid patients, and conveniently ignores the existing safety net available. Proponents of Medicaid expansion will argue that there is no alternative. This is simply not true.

Florida can, and should, work to address the fundamental challenges inherent in improving access to quality health care, as opposed to increasing the number of people with access to inadequate insurance through Medicaid.

The James Madison Institute recommended practical reforms in a 2014 policy brief, and the concepts behind our recommendations are still valid. Florida has made some strides, but there is more to do. We need to address why we have such a shortage of physicians in this state and why so many leave Florida after graduating from medical school. Medical malpractice reform is a good first step. Florida's legal climate is consistently ranked as one of the worst in the U.S., and medical malpractice rates are astronomical because of frivolous lawsuits.

Further, while we embrace groundbreaking technologies in the operating room, we need to be more open to addressing the same advancements in areas such as telemedicine, which can revolutionize care to underserved communities. We also must address the obscene complexities in the cost structure of care delivery and bring forth more transparency to the industry.

Inevitably, discussion of real reforms will run up against powerful entrenched interests whose financial ties are vested in the status quo — but make no mistake, real reform is what's needed.

In Florida, we are faced with a choice — thoughtfully examine the challenge and address the fundamental causes, or take a short-term path toward future calamity. Do we have a serious discussion about the root causes of our health care challenges, or do we give in to the enticement of “free money.”

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, yet expecting a different result. We have the opportunity to show the rest of the nation that positive reforms are possible and that doubling down on bad policy is simply that — more bad policy.

Nuzzo, of Tallahassee, is vice president of policy for The James Madison Institute."

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah has cracked the whip on the faction-ridden party’s Delhi unit and warned its leaders against indulging in any in-fighting ahead of the Assembly polls.

In a strong message to the Delhi BJP leaders, Shah said any “indiscipline” will be dealt with strictly. He has made it clear that there is no scope of any “lobbying” in the party.

Referring to the distribution of tickets for the state elections, the party chief said the workers will have to work to ensure victory of the chosen candidates.

Addressing the concluding session of the Delhi BJP’s state executive meeting on Tuesday, he said: “The party workers should not worry over distribution of tickets. All workers and leaders will have to stay united and ensure victory of the candidates selected by the party. No infighting will be tolerated while indiscipline will invite strict action.”

Shah said a 20-member core panel has been set up for the elections. He also advised the party workers to go full throttle for the polls.

Shah, also the party’s key strategist, emphasised micro-management at the booth level as he appealed to partymen to live up to the expectations of the masses. He asked the workers to focus on door-to-door campaigning, which, he said, was the best way to contact maximum voters.

The party president said: “As part of micro-planning, workers need to reach out to more polling booths than those covered in the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP will never find such a favourable condition in Delhi to form a government. Door-to-door campaigning has been the peculiarity of BJP, which has been copied by other parties.”

Shah, a close aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, lauded the government decision to regularise unauthorised colonies in Delhi. He said the BJP-led government has been fulfilling its promises in a time-bound manner.

He also indicated major policy decision regarding Delhi in the upcoming Budget Session of Parliament.

He added: “The BJP-led government has fulfilled its promises in the past six months. More announcements will be made in the upcoming Budget that will surely benefit Delhiites.”

BJP steps up Capital campaign

By Mail Today in New Delhi

More than 40 Union Cabinet ministers of the BJP will hold nearly 400 public meetings from the first week of January as part of campaigning for the Delhi Assembly polls.

Each minister will hold at least 10 meetings in the Capital and cater to all class of voters including youths, women, professionals and academicians. These rallies will be in addition to those held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

A senior BJP leader said that as per the plan, each leader will target a specific category of voters.

While Home Minister Rajnath Singh will address people in rural Delhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will hold meetings with lawyers and chartered accountants. Jaitley will be assisted by his Cabinet colleague Ravi Shankar Prasad.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and HRD Minister Smriti Irani are expected to cater to women voters.

Similarly, Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu and Fertilisers Minister Ananth Kumar will address rallies in areas dominated by South Indians.

Dr Harsh Vardhan will cater to the medical fraternity. Ministers from Bihar and UP will campaign in east and outer Delhi, the regions dominated by poorvanchalis."

A flight attendant who was on the AirAsia plane that crashed into the Java Sea posted a message to her partner on social media from the air just a fortnight before the disaster.

Khairunnisa Haidar Fauzi, 22, regularly uploaded photos to Instagram, including one of a hand-written note on a napkin held up against a plane cabin window.



“I love you from the 38,000 feet,” the note reads.

It was posted on December 17, less than two weeks before the crash.

It is thought to have been for her boyfriend, who is mentioned in several of her Instagram posts.

Other pictures on her account show her in her flight attendant uniform.

One of the seven bodies found so far has been confirmed as belonging to a flight attendant.

Local media has reported her name tag was still pinned to her when her body was pulled from the water.

Relatives held the first funeral for a victim of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 as bad weather continues to hamper efforts to locate the wreckage of the plane which crashed into the Java Sea off Borneo with 162 on board.

Nine bodies have so far been retrieved in the search for the Airbus A320-200, which disappeared from radar during a storm Sunday en route from Indonesia's second city of Surabaya to Singapore.

Search officials said the return of rough weather was hindering efforts to locate the plane and the rest of the bodies.

""The problem we faced today is unfriendly weather conditions,"" search and rescue agency chief Bambang Soelistyo told a press conference. ""The waves were between three and four metres.""

Pointing to weather charts, he said the search teams would persevere even though conditions were expected to remain bad for days to come.

""From tomorrow until the fourth, with the existing forces, calculations and tactics we have, we will still be fighting, but I hope we can still get some results despite having to face such conditions.""

He said a National Transport Safety Committee team was in Pangkalun Bun, a town on Borneo island with the nearest airstrip to the crash site.

""Tomorrow they will depart to try to find the flight recorder,"" he said.

French and Singaporean experts were also set to join the search for the black boxes, which are crucial to determining the cause of the crash.

First funeral

The first funeral took place yesterday afternoon after one of the bodies was formally identified as a woman named Hayati Lutfiah Hami, and was handed over to her family in Surabaya.

Family and friends gathered at a cemetery in the Indoenesian capital.

After prayers at her home, the coffin was taken for burial at a Muslim cemetery nearby, with more than a hundred neighbours in attendance.

""I am grateful to God that my sister-in-law was found and I hope the rescuers find the others as soon as possible,"" Agung Wahyu Darmono, 38, said.

Police said they were still working on formal identification of one young man.

A crisis centre for identifying the victims has been set up at a hospital in Surabaya with facilities to store 150 bodies.

Search for black boxes

AirAsia chief Tony Fernandes said Thursday the search appeared to be closing in on its final location.

""I am hoping that the latest information is correct and aircraft has been found. Please all hope together. This is so important,"" Fernandes said on Twitter.

It was not clear what his source was and the Indonesian naval commander heading the international search fleet was more cautious.

""We cannot be sure,"" of the exact location, First Admiral Rasyid Kacong, commander of the warship KRI Banda Aceh, told AFP.

""The plan is we want some divers to embark on the Banda Aceh. Then we can go to the suspected location,"" he said.

""I can only be sure that it is a plane after we dive. We are also looking for the black boxes.""

Indonesian national air safety investigator Toos Sanitioso told AFP they ""hope optimistically"" to find the plane in the near future but warned it could take at least a week.

The plane is believed to be in relatively shallow water of around 25-32 metres (82-105 feet).

During searches Tuesday, which retrieved wreckage giving the first confirmation that the flight had crashed, an air force plane saw a ""shadow"" on the seabed believed to be the missing plane. All efforts are now being concentrated there.

Debris found so far includes an exit door, an emergency slide, several suitcases and part of an AirAsia trolley.

Before take-off the pilot had asked for permission to fly at a higher altitude to avoid a storm. But his request was not approved due to other planes above him on the popular route, according to AirNav, Indonesia's air traffic control.

In his last communication, Captain Iriyanto, an experienced former air force pilot, said he wanted to change course to avoid the menacing storm system. Then all contact was lost, about 40 minutes after the plane had taken off.

Of the 162 passengers and crew on board Flight QZ8501, 155 were Indonesian, with three South Koreans, one Singaporean, one Malaysian, one Briton and a Frenchman -- co-pilot Remi Plesel.

The plane was operated by AirAsia Indonesia, a unit of Malaysia-based AirAsia, which previously had a solid safety record.

The crash came at the end of a disastrous year for Malaysian air travel.

After the disappearance of Flight MH370 in March, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew, another Malaysia Airlines flight -- MH17 -- was shot down over Ukraine in July, killing all 298 on board.

In further bad news for AirAsia, one of its pilots tested positive for morphine, AirAsia Indonesia president director Sunu Widyatmoko said Thursday, adding however that further tests were needed since the pilot had been taking flu medicine which could give a false result.

Ill-fated plane's ‘bizarre descent’

Leaked documents have revealed the ill-fated AirAsia flight QZ8501 encountered a 'bizarre' decent before it crashed into the Java Sea, analysts say.

Aviation Editor at The West Australian Geoffery Thomas said the new evidence shows the plane experienced a freak thunderstorm that sent it on a terrifying ride impossible to steer before it plummeted into the ocean.

""Radar play back of the plane’s flight path leaked by Indonesian authorities show it climbing at 9000 feet per minute and then being slammed into a dive at 24,000 feet per minute,"" he said.

However, the planes forward speed was barely 100 kilometres per hour.

Video Radar data shows AirAsia QZ8501 made steep climb before crash

""The plane had encountered serve weather and was well above its assigned altitude at a forward speed less than required to sustain flight,"" Mr Thomas said.

A leaked radar screenshot from air traffic controller AirNav Indonesia shows the plane climbing through 36,300 feet without permission and critically lost 200 kilometres per hour, which meant it could no longer keep flying at that altitude.

Indonesian aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman told Fairfax that according to the leaked information, the plane ""was like a piece of metal being thrown down"".

“It's really hard to comprehend... the way it goes down is bordering on the edge of logic.""

Mr Soejatman said the ‘extremely low ground speed’ - as little as 61 knots during the descent - was equally baffling.

Such a figure suggests the plane was heading almost straight down, explaining why it was found in the water just 10km from its last point of radar contact, he said.

Before take-off the pilot of QZ8501 had asked for permission to fly at a higher altitude to avoid a storm, but his request was not approved due to other planes above him on the popular route, according to AirNav, Indonesia's air traffic control.

Six other airliners were crowding the airspace, forcing Flight 8501 to remain at a lower altitude.

Then all contact was lost, about 40 minutes after the plane had taken off.

Only five minutes later, the jet had disappeared from radar screens without issuing a distress signal.

The resolution, which was voted on Tuesday, was aimed at achieving a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank by late 2017.

Eight nations on the 15-member council votes yes, two voted no and five abstained. Nine votes were required for passage. The no votes came from the United States and Australia.

Had nine votes been obtained, the United States, which voted against the resolution, was expected to exercise its Security Council veto.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, called the draft resolution “deeply imbalanced” and slammed the council for the unusual move of putting the resolution to a vote without any debate.

“We voted against it because we know what everyone here knows as well: Peace will come from hard choices and compromises that must come at the negotiating table,” Power said.

“This text addresses the concerns of only one side,” she said. “It would undermine efforts to get back to an atmosphere that achieves two states for two peoples.”

The deadlines in the resolution, Power noted, “take no account of Israel’s legitimate security concerns.”

The vote took place shortly after 5 P.M. EST on Tuesday.

274|Can Microsoft's 'Spartan' compete with Chrome, Mozilla?|"WASHINGTON -- Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, a subsidiary of The Mosaic Company, has reached around $2 billion settlements with federal and state environmental agencies to resolve charges of mismanagement of onsite waste materials at its fertilizer manufacturing facilities in Florida and Louisiana.



Announcing the settlements, which are subject to court approval, the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Thursday said Mosaic Fertilizer has committed to ensure the proper treatment, storage and disposal of an estimated 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste at six Mosaic facilities in Florida and two in Louisiana.



The settlement resolves a series of alleged violations by Mosaic of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which provides universal guidelines for how hazardous waste must be stored, handled and disposed.



The 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste addressed in this case is the largest ever covered by a federal or state RCRA settlement and will ensure that wastewater at Mosaic's facilities is properly managed and does not pose a threat to groundwater resources.



At Mosaic's eight facilities in Florida and Louisiana, hazardous waste from fertilizer production is currently stored in large piles, tanks, ditches and ponds. The piles are as high as 500 feet and cover more than 600 acres, making them some of the largest manmade waste piles in the United States.



The piles can also contain several billion gallons of highly acidic wastewater, which can threaten human health and cause severe environmental damage if it reaches groundwater or local waterways.



Under the settlement, Mosaic Fertilizer will establish a $630 million trust fund, which will be invested until it reaches full funding of $1.8 billion.



These funds will cover the future closure of four Mosaic facilitiesthe Bartow, New Wales and Riverview plants in Florida and the Uncle Sam plant in Louisianaand also be put toward the treatment of hazardous wastewater at and long-term care of those facilities and two additional facilities which are already undergoing closure.



Mosaic Fertilizer's parent company, which is one of the largest fertilizer maker, will provide financial guarantees for this work. The settlement also requires Mosaic Fertilizer to submit a $50 million letter of credit.



Mosaic has committed to spend $170 million on projects to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing and waste management programs at its facilities and $2.2 million on two local environmental projects.



Mosaic will also pay a $5 million civil penalty to the United States, $1.55 million to the State of Louisiana and $1.45 million to the State of Florida, who joined the Department of Justice and EPA as plaintiffs in this case.



""This settlement represents our most significant enforcement action in the mining and mineral processing arena, and will have a significant impact on bringing all Mosaic facilities into compliance with the law,"" said Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division in a statement.



""Moreover, through this settlement, we establish critical financial assurance to cover the enormous closure and care costs at all these facilities. This sets the standard for our continuing enforcement of RCRA in the entire phosphoric acid industry. And, it reflects our emphasis on working jointly with impacted states.""



The alleged violations in this case stem from storage and disposal of waste from the production of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, key components of fertilizers, at Mosaic's facilities in Bartow, Lithia, Mulberry and Riverview, Florida, and St. James and Uncle Sam, Louisiana.



At all these units Mosaic failed to properly treat, store, and dispose of hazardous waste, and also failed provide adequate financial assurance for closure of its facilities.



""This case is a major victory for clean water, public health and communities across Florida and Louisiana,"" said Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles for EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.



Mosaic produces phosphorus-based fertilizer that is commonly applied to corn, wheat and other crops across the country. Sulfuric acid is used to extract phosphorus from mined rock, which produces large quantities of a solid material called phosphogypsum and wastewater that contains high levels of acid.



EPA inspections revealed that Mosaic was mixing certain types of highly-corrosive substances from its fertilizer operations, which qualify as hazardous waste, with the phosphogypsum and wastewater from mineral processing, which is a violation of federal and state hazardous waste laws.



As part of EPA's National Enforcement Initiative for mining and mineral processing, the agency has required phosphate fertilizer production facilities to reduce the storage volumes of hazardous wastewaters, ensure that waste piles and ponds have environmentally-protective barriers installed and verify the structural stability of waste piles and ponds.



Mosaic has committed to spending approximately $170 million over the next several years to implement an innovative reconfiguration of their current operations and waste management systems.



Under the settlement, Mosaic will also fund a $1.2 million environmental project in Florida to mitigate and prevent certain potential environmental impacts associated with an orphaned industrial property located in Mulberry, Florida. In Louisiana, Mosaic will spend $1 million to fund studies regarding statewide water quality issues.



Commenting on the settlement, Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Mosaic Company, said, ""We are pleased to be bringing this matter to a close.""



""In the years since EPA began this enforcement initiative, Mosaic has voluntarily made a number of major improvements to and significant capital investments in our facilities to enhance environmental performance, and the settlements will build upon that good work,"" added O'Rourke."

276|CSC pays $190M to settle 4-year-old accounting fraud case with SEC|"CSC will restate its results for 2010 through 2012, and has promised not to violate US antifraud, reporting and accounting laws in future

IT services company CSC will pay US$190 million to settle a case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over four-year-old charges that it violated U.S. antifraud, reporting, and books-and-records laws. The company did not admit guilt, but has promised not to violate those laws in future.

The charges concerned accounting entries relating to CSC's activities in Australia and Denmark, and to the company's contractual relationship with the U.K National Health Service (NHS) over the failed National Program for IT (NPfIT), the company said.

It published details of the settlement Monday, in a filing with the SEC dated Friday.

The company has previously acknowledged accounting irregularities in Australia and Denmark, uncovered in internal audits triggered by the SEC's investigation.

CSC will book a $200 million charge to cover the fine and the cost of compliance. That sum, though, is dwarfed by the disputed $2.75 billion goodwill impairment charge relating to the failed NHS project, of which the SEC ordered CSC to move $2.51 billion to its 2011 financial year from 2012.

That came about partly because CSC overestimated the profit it had made on the partially completed contract. It agreed with the SEC that in future it will assume zero profit from contract revenue accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis.

As a result of the restatements, CSC's consolidated reports for its financial years from 2009 through 2012 should no longer be relied upon, the company said.

Last month CSC reported results for the second quarter of its 2015 financial year.

For the three months to Oct. 3, it reported revenue of $3.08 billion, down 3.4 percent from a year earlier, and net earnings of $151 million, down from $232 million a year earlier. The company is still carrying $1.68 billion of goodwill on its books. The company's revenue is comes almost equally from three streams: global business services, global infrastructure services, and North American public sector services, with the proportions more or less stable over the past year. The infrastructure services division is struggling compared to the other two, with around half the operating margin of its siblings, and half the value in forward bookings.

277|Rocket strike on Afghan wedding party kills at least 26 people|"A rocket fired amid fighting between Taliban insurgents and Afghan soldiers killed at least 26 people at a nearby wedding party Thursday, authorities said, a grim end to a year that saw the end of the 13-year U.S.-led combat mission there.

The rocket struck a house in southern Helman province’s Sangin District, where Afghan security forces have been battling insurgents in the six months since U.S. forces withdrew from the area.

Police spokesman Fareed Ahmad Obaid said the rocket wounded at least 45 people. Bashir Ahmad Shakir, a provincial council member, said the death toll could be up to 30 killed with as many as 60 wounded.

Abdul Haleem, a cousin of the bride who was hosting her wedding, said that nine of his children were missing after the rocket struck his house as guests waited outside for the bride to arrive.

“Nine children of mine are missing; I just collected body parts,” he said. “I don’t know whether it’s my children or someone else.”

Wednesday marked the final day of the U.S. and NATO’s combat mission, which began with the invasion that overthrew the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks. Al-Qaeda then enjoyed safe haven in Afghanistan, where the Taliban ruled according to its own violent interpretation of Islamic law.

Afghanistan’s own 350,000-member-strong forces officially take responsibility for security starting Thursday. The insurgency has been testing the resolve of the army and police, who officials say are holding their ground even as the number of attacks increases and casualties soar.

This year was the deadliest of the war for government forces and civilians, with around 5,000 Afghan soldiers and police killed, officials have said. An estimated 10,000 civilians have been killed or wounded, the highest annual toll since the United Nations started keeping figures in 2008.

In much of the south and east, government forces are facing off against the Taliban without the assistance of coalition air support or medical evacuations. They have taken heavy casualties but have thus far prevented the Taliban from seizing large swaths of territory. Interior Ministry spokesman Seddiq Seddiqi said the insurgents had “failed to capture even one district.”

Afghan forces may also receive a boost from warming ties with neighbouring Pakistan. After the school massacre in the Pakistani town of Peshawar earlier this month – in which more than 140 people were killed, mainly children – the two U.S. allies vowed to work together to combat insurgents on both sides of the porous border.

President Ashraf Ghani, who took office in September, has said he wants to bring peace to his country after more than 30 years of continuous war. He has bolstered ties with China, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia as part of an effort to isolate the Taliban and bring them to the negotiating table.

First Vice-President Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum said Wednesday that he had reached an agreement with some 300 Taliban fighters in the northern Jawzjan province to lay down arms.

Fighting continued elsewhere in the country. In the eastern Nangahar province, gunmen shot dead a police officer and two civilians after security forces stopped their car and motorcycle, both of which carried explosives. Provincial police chief Gen. Fazel Ahmad Sherzad said police suspected that they were on their way to attack government offices.

In central Uruzgan province, a police officer killed three of his fellow officers and wounded five while they ate dinner Tuesday, spokesman Dost Mohammad Nayab said. The gunman fled after the shooting and authorities had no motive for the attack.

279|Lettuce on Mars? UK students' ambitious project set to put green on the Red Planet|"One of the most necessary elements to building a human colony on Mars is the ability to, well, feed people.

Students from Southampton University are working on that. They have a lettuce-growing project they’re trying to get on Mars One, the project to develop a human colony on the Red Planet. If selected, their lettuce seeds will be among the equipment sent with the first unmanned mission scheduled to launch in 2018.

The scientists took to Reddit to discuss their project:

We’ve designed a greenhouse that could go to Mars and grow lettuce. We’ve submitted our proposal to Mars One as part of their competition for a spot on their lander in 2018, and if we win, we’ll get to do this.

In the Reddit discussion, the students revealed that they picked lettuce for a variety of reasons, including it’s efficiency at converting nutrients to edible material, and it’s easy to fit inside a greenhouse. In fact, experiments growing lettuce are already being conducted on Earth in Mars simulators.

The seeds will be frozen during their space flight, then placed in the Mars greenhouse, where the temperature will be a controlled 21 degrees Celsius, and light from the sun and LEDs will help photosynthesis. They expect lettuce to grow within four weeks of arrival.

The groups says they’ve already passed the technical round with their submission, they are one of 10 finalists, and now it’s up to popular vote who gets on board Mars One. You can vote for the project via Facebook, Google+ and Twitter.

While the robotic mission with supplies and such takes off in 2018, Mars One intends to start sending humans by 2024, with crews of four leaving every two years."
280|Sixty Years of Stepping Out at the International Debutante Ball|"ENLARGE An overview of the 60th International Debutante Ball, at which 46 young women were presented. Patrick McMullan

During the receiving line of the 60th International Debutante Ball, 46 young women in white ballgowns lined up to shake hands and exchange pleasantries with guests for more than two hours. They represented eight foreign countries and 12 American states. There were cousins, sisters, first-time and more seasoned debutantes…and a whole lot of Texans.

Nearly a third of the women presented at the Waldorf Astoria on Monday night came from the Lone Star State.

And unlike the other young women who curtsy when introduced in front of the ballroom, the 15 Texans had to pull off what’s known as the “Texas Dip,” an elaborate bow that finds the debutante with her arms out to the side and her head nearly touching the ground in front of her—though the large, multilayered gown offers a nice cushion.

“Texans take manners and civility seriously,” said Mary Catherine Huffines, whose daughter Deirdre represented the state. “If you’re ever at a stop-sign intersection in Texas, you’ll notice that people wait their turns. They’re polite and civil.”

Words like “civility,” “grace,” “manners” and “tradition” were used repeatedly by the debutantes’ mothers when asked why they wanted their daughters, ages 17 to 24, to participate. For many, the event is a continuation of a family tradition.

Grace Thompson was presented at the Waldorf in 1985, and her daughters, Georgia and Caroline, represented Kansas.

Mrs. Thompson enjoyed her experience—and her dress—so much that she had her debutante gown altered and wore it on her wedding day years later.

“I’m hoping that magic strikes again,” her husband, Jeff, joked about his daughters.

Many of the debutantes from down south have attended smaller events in their hometowns. For others, it was brand new.

Leah Lane, daughter of Broadway producers Stewart Lane and Bonnie Comley, acknowledged she was a bit out of her element.

“She’s so New York,” Ms. Comley said.

Ms. Lane was the youngest of the debutantes, wore black nail polish under her requisite white gloves.

Mr. Lane told us he was drawn to the event as a New York institution. And Ms. Lane is his youngest daughter.

“It’s my last chance to do this,” he said.

Each young woman was accompanied by two escorts—a civilian dressed in white tie and tails and a military cadet.

Debutantes are discouraged from having their boyfriends be their escorts because future breakups could make for some rather undesirable photos on the family mantles.

To meet appropriate escorts, a bachelors’ brunch is held in November.

The military cadet carries the flag of each debutante’s country or state behind her. The event benefits the Soldiers’, Sailors’, Marines’, Coast Guard and Airmen’s Club, which provides housing for service members.

Joanne McGuire, hailing from Scotland, added a nice pop of color to a sea of white dresses on the receiving line, accessorizing with a tartan sash representing her family’s MacQuarrie Clan.

Unlike in Texas, where the debutante tradition is still strong, “it can be quite tricky to find a debutante dress in Scotland,” she told us. Her only options were bridal boutiques.

ENLARGE Guests get playful at the event. Patrick McMullan

While the event was traditionally seen as a way for young women to meet potential suitors, modern-day debutantes often have different intentions. Many have recently graduated or will soon graduate from college and hope to do some networking. Others, like Ms. Lane, like the idea of meeting people from all over the world.

And that was the goal from the beginning, according to 91-year-old Russian Countess Nicholas Bobrinskoy, who attended the first International Debutante Ball in 1954.

“[Founder] Beatrice Dinsmore Joyce believed that you had to have young people from all over the world meet each other and get to know each other to achieve real peace,” she said.

The Countess, whose first name is Tatiana, has designed the ball’s flower arrangements since the beginning. She presented her daughter in 1972 and is hoping her granddaughter will be presented next.

“She wants to do it, but her father doesn’t want her to. So we’ll just have to beat him over the head until he agrees,” she joked."

(Revises death toll, source of reports of second explosion.)

SANAA, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 23 people in central Yemen on Wednesday when he blew himself up at a cultural centre where students were celebrating the Prophet Mohammad's birthday, state news agency Saba said.

At least 48 people were also injured, including many women and children and women, the deputy director of the provincial health department said, according to Saba. The celebration, in the city of Ibb, was organised by the Houthis, the group that controls most of Yemen.

No one claimed responsibility for attack, but it resembles bombings carried out by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which operates in Yemen. AQAP regards Shi'ites, the sect of Islam to which the Houthis belong, as heretics.

Tensions have increased in Yemen since the Houthis captured Sanaa in September and expanded south and west of the capital. The Western-allied country, which shares a long border with the world's top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, had been trying to overcome an al Qaeda threat before the Houthi advance.

Medics and residents earlier put Wednesday's death toll at 33, saying that 20 bodies were transferred to al-Thawra hospital and 13 others were taken to another hospital.

A local resident said the final death toll was likely to rise and might be more than 33. The resident, who declined to be identified, said the director general of the Ibb governorate was among the dead, but the governor, who was reported to have been wounded, had escaped unharmed.

President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, in a condolence message to the Ibb governor and families of the victims, condemned ""the terrorist and criminal"" attack and instructed the government to ensure the wounded receive full medical attention, Saba said.

Residents reported a second explosion occurred outside one of the two hospitals, al-Thawra. But security sources later said that security forces had been firing in the air to disperse residents who had gathered in front of the hospital.

283|Live TV coverage of anti-terror ops may be banned|"Live TV coverage of anti-terror ops may be banned

New Delhi, Dec 31, 2014, (PTI)

Live coverage of anti-terror operations by television channels is likely to be banned soon as the Home Ministry has asked the Information and Broadcasting Ministry to amend the rules to stop such telecast.



Citing the unpleasant experience during 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks when news channels broadcast NSG operations live, the Home Ministry told the I&B Ministry to amend the Programme Code under the Cable Television Network Rules so that no terror-related operation is telecast live in future.



In its letter, the Home Ministry said such live coverage not only affects the secrecy and effectiveness of the operation but also puts the safety of security forces, common people and journalists in jeopardy, official sources said.



However, the I&B Ministry is yet to respond to the Home Ministry's request sent about a month ago.



After the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the National Broadcaster Association put out a set of rules, including restriction on live reporting of terror situations, as part of a self-regulation exercise on the part of private broadcasters.



However, so far there is no official ban on live coverage of anti-terror operations.

The Home Ministry is asking for more changes to the 15-point Programme Code prescribed under the Cable Television Network Rules, 1994 for this purpose. The rules were amended in 2009 when private broadcasters were brought within the ambit of the Cable Television Networks Rules.



During the Mumbai terror attacks, television channels had broadcast live images, including the moves by security forces, para-dropping of commandos, which led the authorities to intervene and stop it.



Live coverage of an NSG chopper operation at Nariman House was seen to be of particular concern to the government as it was revealed that the controllers of the terrorists sitting in Pakistan were monitoring TV channels to guide the attackers.



At that time, the I&B Ministry had issued directives to TV channels asking them to exercise caution while covering terror incidents.



In 2011, another advisory was issued pointing out that some TV channels telecast interviews with terrorists or terrorist groups, which the government said could help them to advance their agenda.



It was also pointed out that such coverage would amount to violation of the provisions of the Programme Code. The Code so far mentions a broad category — that programmes which contain anything affecting the integrity of the nation shouldn't be carried in a cable service.

MANILA Flash floods and mudslides have killed at least 53 people in the central and southern Philippines, the national disaster agency said on Wednesday, after days of heavy rains that have also hit neighbouring Southeast Asian countries.

Tropical storm Jangmi prompted the evacuation of more than 86,000 people in Surigao del Sur, Bohol and Cebu provinces before weakening into a tropical depression.

A powerful typhoon killed 18 people this month and forced more than 1 million people to flee to shelters in what a U.N. agency said was one of the world's biggest peacetime evacuations.

Malaysia's worst flooding in a decade forced nearly a quarter of a million people from their homes, officials said on Tuesday, with the government coming under renewed fire for its perceived slow response.

288|Moose Hide Campaign helps men address violence against aboriginal women|"OTTAWA—Paul Lacerte was out hunting moose with his teenage daughter along the infamous Highway of Tears in northern B.C. three years ago when he happened upon a simple, yet innovative idea that has become central to his work to end violence against aboriginal women and girls.

As he watched his daughter, Raven, skin the moose on their annual family hunting trip, Lacerte thought of how he had been one of only a handful of male participants at a national forum on violence against indigenous women in Vancouver that year.

“Women are bearing the burden of abuse, but they also have to bear the burden of advocacy to effect change, and this is a men’s problem as much as it is a women’s problem,” Lacerte, executive director of the B.C. Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres, said from Victoria.

Inspired in part by the White Ribbon Campaign co-founded by former NDP leader Jack Layton, who had died that year, Lacerte decided to tan the moose hide, cut it up into little squares, punch a hole in the corner, pin it to his lapel on the left-hand side and then hand them out for other men to wear.

“People would ask: ‘What is that?’ and we’d say, ‘Thank you for asking. I’m speaking out against violence toward aboriginal women and children,’ ” Lacerte said, and a grassroots movement was born.

Since that day, the Moose Hide Campaign has distributed some 20,000 squares of moose hide nationwide, including at the B.C. legislature, where many MLAs this year wore it inside the House.

The goal is to reach 1 million within the next 10 years.

The RCMP estimated earlier this year that nearly 1,200 aboriginal women and girls have been murdered or gone missing in Canada in the past three decades.

With the Conservative government making it clear it will not support a national public inquiry on missing and murdered indigenous women, some organizations, such as those involved with the urban-based friendship centre movement, are focusing their efforts on prevention.

One of those people is Sylvia Maracle, executive director of the Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres, which runs a program called Kizhaay Anishinaabe Niin (“I am a kind man”) to train men to be leaders and role models on this issue within their communities.

While Maracle is not against an inquiry, she wants it to go beyond data-gathering and emotional catharsis.

“I want to make sure that it results in an action plan, that provincial, territorial, federal and aboriginal governments commit to creating the kind of socio-economic change that will have to occur to really begin to address the roots of violence against aboriginal women and girls,” Maracle said.

That approach likely has a better chance of gaining traction with the Conservative government, which announced a $25-million “action plan” on violence against aboriginal women and girls last September.

Jeffrey Cyr, the executive director of the Ottawa-based National Association of Friendship Centres, said his organization will be receiving some support from that action plan as it expands a series of initiatives on ending violence against aboriginal women and girls — including the Moose Hide Campaign and Kizhaay Anishinaabe Niin — to the national level in the spring of 2015.

And since the rate of intimate partner violence against aboriginal women is more than twice that of other women, according to Statistics Canada, prevention means having difficult conversations about the fact ending violence against aboriginal women needs to involve ending violence by aboriginal men.

“A lot of the time, it’s going to start with internal reflection about what we see in our communities. Even if you’re not a perpetrator, standing passively by is equally as bad,” said Cyr.

It is widely acknowledged that much of that violence within the indigenous community in Canada is what is known as lateral violence, stemming from the intergenerational trauma of colonialism in general and the residential school system in particular.

“Our culture was always to protect our women, not to hurt them, so that shift in our behaviour came from the residential schools, and to take our power back means to stop behaving like that and to stand up and protect our women, like healthy warriors,” said Lacerte, whose father was a residential school survivor.

Lacerte believes the Moose Hide Campaign is a great way to spark a conversation about what can be an extremely sensitive subject.

“We have to have honest conversations in public now, or else this is going to continue,” said Lacerte, who managed to get everyone to wear the moose hide for a day in the B.C. legislature and wishes to see the same being done on Parliament Hill.

Cyr said the organic, icebreaking nature of the Moose Hide Campaign works to build bridges between aboriginal and non-aboriginal men as well.

“It’s a way of cracking an uncomfortable subject for people who aren’t necessarily steeped in it,” Cyr said.

Cyr recalled visiting Parliament Hill in September and being asked by a young male aide to a minister why he what the yellowish square on his lapel was supposed to mean.

The answer led to more questions: How widespread is the problem? How does it happen? What is the role of men and boys?

Cyr believes that short discussion will have an impact in other ways."

Rationale for vouchers, school choice keeps changing

Living in Florida it’s not just the weather that changes every 15 minutes, but the rationale behind school choice, too.

First, vouchers and charters were about getting kids out of failing public schools, but when it turned out that public schools were doing better than charters — over 260 have failed and nobody has any real idea how voucher schools are doing, because the system was set up so they could avoid both financial and academic accountability — they changed the narrative to one that emphasized competition.

The reasoning was that competition would make everybody better. Well, charters and vouchers as a group didn’t get that memo. One scandal after another has made the headlines, and neither perform better than the public schools they are seeking to replace. In fact, quite often the only thing they made better were the bank accounts of their operators.

Now they have changed the narrative once again, this time to parents needing a choice. I don’t think it should be lost on anybody that this narrative only surfaced after the first two failed and corporate America figured out there was a lot of money to make off education.

I and many others believe this is just another red herring designed to distract us from the dismal record of charters, the lack of accountability with vouchers and to hide their real agenda — the destruction of teacher unions and the privatization of our schools.

The answer to our education problems should be to adequately fund our schools instead of continuing to change the reason why we should instead funnel public money into poorer options.

I wonder what school choice supporters’ next narrative will be.

Compare ‘The Interview’ with Chaplin movie ‘The Dictator’

I have been waiting for weeks to hear someone say the things Rekha Basu did in the op-ed piece about the movie “The Interview” (“Should satire be as clueless as ‘The Interview’?,” Dec. 29). There have been many film depictions of persons showing character deficiencies, for which some have died in the movie — but they were not living persons.

Hitler and all his top brass, including film director Leni Reifenstahl, “died” at the end of the Brad Pitt movie “Inglorious Basterds.” The military leaders in “Dr. Strangelove” suffered, but they were not playing the part of real persons. All these, and others, dealt with past history.

The best movie to use as a comparison with “The Interview” — because both objects of the comedy are/were alive — is “The Great Dictator,” Charlie Chaplin’s creation of the characters Adenoid Hynkel of Tomania (Hitler) and Bernzino Napoloni of Bacteria (Mussolini).

Far worse than death is the ending in which all Hitler’s propaganda is logically countered in a speech made by Hitler’s stand-in (for security reasons), a barber who looked like him. Chaplin’s movie was made right before World War II, when the characters being made fun of were alive and active. It was a very brave, imaginative and effective thing for him to do.

The Motion Picture Association of America should put in place a rule against depicting the killing of known figures while they are alive.

Thank you for logically analyzing the current situation and publishing your piece.

An estimated 1.5 million people lined Australia’s Sydney Harbour at the stroke of midnight for a spectacular show involving seven tons of fireworks over the Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House.

Japanese revellers welcomed 2015 by releasing hundreds of balloons in front of Tokyo Tower.

Fireworks exploded off Taiwan’s tallest skyscraper.

And North Korea staged a 15-minute long fireworks display in Pyongyang — watched by thousands– although no sign of that country’s leader.

And then there’s Bolivia where folks flocked to shops and street markets to find the perfect pair of lucky underwear to welcome 2015.

In accordance with their annual tradition, Bolivians swap their old underwear for red or yellow undergarments at midnight in the hopes of ushering in a prosperous new year. Red is believed to bear love, while yellow is thought to bring money.

London and Berlin also ushered in 2015 with spectacular fireworks displays.

294|Mother Jones Reveals Drunk Walkers 8 Times More Likely to be Killed on New Year's Eve|"(Newser) – New Year's Eve culminates in a circus of drunk drivers and pedestrians going home after a night of merry-making—and experts say drunk pedestrians are eight times more likely to be killed on the way than drunk drivers. New Year's Day is the most dangerous day to be on foot, studies have shown; you're 1.7 times more likely to be killed while walking on New Year's Day than any regular day, reports Mother Jones. (Not surprisingly: Almost half of the fatal accidents take place during the wee hours, and 58% of the pedestrians killed are intoxicated.) Drunk driving is a well-known danger, but ""the risks associated with drinking and walking aren't as clear to the average person,"" says one highway safety researcher. Half of 2012's fatal New Year's Eve crashes involved alcohol—and in those, 34% of the walkers were drunk versus 14% of the drivers. The reason is simple—drunk people often cross against a sign, jaywalk, or even lie down in the road.

So what can America's cities do about it? Lower speed limits and brighter street lights help, and some big cities are moving in that direction. We also need more observant bartenders willing to cut off tipsy customers, experts say. Even automotive technology is trying to curb the stats with a camera that slams your brakes if a pedestrian is in the way. But until then, New Year's Eve partiers will have to help themselves—by wearing bright clothes, sticking close to sober buddies, and staying in groups. You could also take Uber, of course, but Silicon Beat warns that the ride-sharing company will be charging much higher rates than usual—if you need a ride during the prime period between 12:30am and 2:30am, don't be surprised if you're charged a minimum of four to five times the typical rate. Last year in Pennsylvania, a Twitter user claimed a 4.85-mile ride cost $265. (These are the drunkest days of the year.)

295|Scientists play God with man-made cosmos|"AP and Network Writers AP

SCIENTISTS have exercised godlike powers by creating an entire universe of their own.

The man-made cosmos is a computer simulation in which galaxies similar to those observed by astronomers grow and evolve.

Two of the world’s most powerful supercomputers — the Cosmology Machine at the University of Durham and Curie in Paris — were used to conduct the simulations, which took several months to run.

“The universe generated by the computer is just like the real thing. There are galaxies everywhere, with all the shapes, sizes and colours I’ve seen with the world’s largest telescopes,” Professor Richard Bower, from the University of Durham, said.

“It is incredible. In the Eagle universe I can even press a button to make time run backwards.”

Previous attempts to model the formation of galaxies have met with little success, producing collections of stars that were often too massive, small, old or spherical.

Simulation of Galaxy Formation

Those produced in the Eagle (Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environments) simulation are much more realistic.

One key to its success is the recreation of galactic winds — cosmic gas gales driven by stars, supernova explosions and supermassive black holes — which are stronger than those in earlier simulations, say the scientists.

Galactic winds affect the development of galaxies by blowing away the gas from which stars form.

The sizes and shapes of the thousands of galaxies produced in the Eagle simulation closely match their “real” counterparts, and can be used to study the history of the universe almost as far back as the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

Results from the research will appear in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."

298|Indonesia vows 'all-out effort' in search for AirAsia victims|"PANGKALAN BUN: Indonesian rescuers promised an ""all-out effort"" to search for bodies from AirAsia Flight QZ8501 as the weather cleared Thursday and international investigators joined attempts to locate the fuselage of the ill-fated plane.

Seven bodies have so far been retrieved from the Airbus A320-200 carrying 162 people, which crashed Sunday in the sea near Borneo island en route from Indonesia's second city Surabaya to Singapore.

Rough weather Wednesday had hampered efforts to locate and retrieve more bodies but conditions had since improved.

""The weather is clear today. We're making an all-out effort to search for bodies and locate the fuselage,"" search and rescue official Sunarbowo Sandi told AFP from Pangkalan Bun, a town on Borneo with the nearest airstrip to the crash site.

He said foreign experts would join Indonesian transport safety investigators in the search to locate the wreckage and retrieve the black boxes, which are key to determining the cause of the crash.

""Ten investigators from the national transport safety committee (KNKT) along with two French and two Singapore investigators will join the search today to locate the fuselage,"" he said.

""We hope that an underwater beacon will be able to detect the weak signal transmitted by the ELT (emergency locator transmitter),"" he added.

The transmitter sends a signal that helps rescuers to find a plane in the event of an accident.

Four bodies have so far been transferred to land from warships with three more set to be moved Thursday.

""Three helicopters are getting ready to hoist three remaining bodies from the navy ship to Pangkalan Bun,"" he said, adding that rescuers managed to bring two bodies to the town late Wednesday.

Two other bodies have already been transferred to Surabaya where there are examination and identification facilities for 150 bodies.

Police have taken DNA samples and medical data from dozens of relatives of the victims to aid in identification of the bodies.

Before take-off the pilot had asked for permission to fly at a higher altitude to avoid a storm, but his request was not approved due to other planes above him on the popular route, according to AirNav, Indonesia's air traffic control.

In his last communication, the pilot said he wanted to change course to avoid the menacing storm system. Then all contact was lost, about 40 minutes after the plane had taken off. – AFP"
299|Palestinian draft resolution fails in UN Security Council as US votes against|"UNITED NATIONS — The UN Security Council on Tuesday rejected a Palestinian resolution calling for Israel to withdraw from Palestinian territories by late 2017.

The resolution called for negotiations to be based on territorial lines that existed before Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. It also called for a peace deal within 12 months.

Even if the draft had received the minimum nine votes in favor, it would have been defeated by Washington's vote against it. The United States is one of the five veto-wielding permanent members.

There were eight votes in favor, two against and five abstentions. Australia joined the United States in voting against the measure.

US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power defended Washington's position against the draft in a speech to the 15-nation council by saying it was not a vote against peace between Israeli and the Palestinians.

""The United States every day searches for new ways to take constructive steps to support the parties in making progress toward achieving a negotiated settlement,"" she said. ""The Security Council resolution put before us today is not one of those constructive steps.""

""It is deeply imbalanced and contains many elements that are not conducive to negotiations between the parties, including unconstructive deadlines that take no account of Israel’s legitimate security concerns,"" she said, adding that it ""was put to a vote without a discussion or due consideration among council members.""

Jordanian Ambassador Dina Kawar expressed regret that the resolution was voted down.

""We had hoped that the Security Council will today adopt the draft Arab resolution because the council bears both the legal and moral responsibilities to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" she said.

The defeat of the resolution was not surprising. Washington, council diplomats said, had made clear it did not want such a resolution put to a vote before Israel's election in March.

The Palestinians, the diplomats said, insisted on putting the resolution to a vote despite the fact that it was clear Washington would not let it pass. Their sudden announcement last weekend that Ramallah wanted a vote before the new year surprised Western delegations on the council.

ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS TRADE INSULTS

In order to pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the council's five permanent members.

The European and African camps were split in the vote. France and Luxembourg voted in favor of the resolution while Britain and Lithuania abstained. Among the Africans, Chad voted yes while Rwanda and Nigeria abstained.

Palestinian observer Riyad Mansour said the defeated resolution was the result of 3-1/2 months of efforts after the recent Israeli war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. He said it was time to end the ""abhorrent Israeli occupation and impunity that has brought our people so much suffering.""

""The result of today's vote shows that the Security Council as a whole is clearly not ready and willing to shoulder its responsibilities in a way that would ... allow us to open the doors to for peace,"" he said. ""It is thus most regrettable that the Security Council remains paralyzed.""

Mansour added that the Palestinian leadership ""must now consider its next steps."" He did not elaborate.

In a very brief statement, Israeli delegate Israel Nitzan told the council that the Palestinians have found every possible opportunity to avoid direct negotiations and came to the council with ""a preposterous unilateral proposal.""

""I have news for the Palestinians - you cannot agitate and provoke your way to a state,"" he said.

French Ambassador Francois Delattre said Paris would continue its efforts to get a resolution through the council that would help move peace efforts forward.

""France regrets that it isn't possible to reach a consensus today,"" he said. ""But our efforts must not stop here. It is our responsibility to try again.""

An earlier Palestinian draft called for Jerusalem to be the shared capital of Israel and a Palestinian state. The draft that was voted on reverted to a harder line, saying only that East Jerusalem would be Palestine's capital and calling for an end to Israeli settlement building.

The Israeli government had said that a Security Council vote, following the collapse in April of US-brokered talks on Palestinian statehood, would only deepen the conflict.

The Palestinians, frustrated by the lack of progress in peace talks, have sought to internationalize the issue by seeking U.N. membership and recognition of statehood via membership in international organizations.

Israel, which pulled troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005, has said its eastern border would be indefensible if it withdrew completely from the West Bank."
300|Murder suspect: Ex-PAF employee moved to Peshawar jail from Haripur|"Niaz Muhamm­ad was senten­ced to death by an air force court at PAF Base Chakla­la on Octobe­r 4,200

PESHAWAR / HARIPUR: A former Pakistan Air Force (PAF) employee, convicted for a murder attempt on former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, has been shifted to the Central Prison in Peshawar from Haripur where he could be hanged any time.

Niaz Muhammad was sentenced to death by an air force court at PAF Base Chaklala on October 4, 2005.

“He was shifted to Peshawar secretly and then the news was made public. It has been done successfully as militants had threatened to intercept and attack the shifting convoy and even shoot down the helicopter carrying him,” a jail official told The Express Tribune on the condition of anonymity.

There were eight death warrants for prisoners in Haripur Jail and Muhammad Niaz, son of Amir Muhammad, a resident of Swabi, was sentenced under section 120/120 B/324 OOC/Fata, he added.

In a broadcast from the National Memorial Arboretum, the Most Rev Justin Welby talked about the disasters and wars in 2014.

He urged people not to let crises, such as Ebola, ""slip from our minds"".

The archbishop was unable to deliver his Christmas Day sermon because he was suffering from pneumonia.

In his New Year address, he reflected on his surroundings and Britain's armed forces.

The Arboretum's Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire is dedicated to those who have served their country since 1948. The nation owes them a debt of ""unspeakable gratitude"", Archbishop Welby said.

He went on to speak about conflict in the Middle East and Nigeria, and the persecution of Christians and other minorities. He said the UK - with its Christian heritage - should not turn its back on the suffering.

""When we are at our best, living out the generosity of Jesus Christ, as that has formed itself in our national character, when we turn outwards and use our best resources to change this world in which we live, we see what a wonderful heritage we have, and the hope we can bring to the poorest and those with the greatest suffering on the face of our planet,"" he said.

He also spoke of Britain's generosity abroad, including the aid sent to Sierra Leone, which is in the grip of the deadly Ebola outbreak.

""In the week just before Christmas I was in Sierra Leone, very briefly,"" he said.

""There I saw the result of British generosity, of aid poured in to support a country torn apart by Ebola, and the extraordinary dedication of British service personnel, working with charities, funded by our aid budget.""

The 58-year-old was forced to pull out of his Christmas Day address at Canterbury Cathedral after being confined to bed with pneumonia.

His sermon, an annual tradition, was instead released as a statement in which he reflected on lasting peace. The Dean of Canterbury, the Very Reverend Robert Willis, delivered a homily in his place.

As well as being the leader of the Church of England, the archbishop is the spiritual leader of the 77 million-strong worldwide Anglican Communion.

In the past year, the archbishop has travelled more than 150,000 miles (240,000km) to meet the rest of the Anglican communion.

The message will be broadcast on BBC One at 12.45 GMT."

SUDDENLY ALONE

Just 15, Chiara Natasha lost her entire family in the tragedy.

Chiara's parents and two brothers were flying to visit her in Singapore, where she had just moved in early November to study on a Singapore government scholarship.

World ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1

The family had sent her off from Surabaya airport less than two months ago, promising to visit her to celebrate New Year's and help her settle into dormitory life at the Methodist Girls' School, said her aunt, Linda Patricia.

Chiara, a petite teenager with long black hair, had flown back to Surabaya herself on Sunday — the day Flight 8501 went missing — and waited at the airport Monday and Tuesday for clues about the plane, praying hard that her family had survived.

News that some wreckage from the plane had been spotted and six bodies retrieved left Chiara in shock and she kept crying when relatives tried to console her, her aunt said. Chiara didn't come to the airport on Wednesday.

Her older brother, Nico Giovanni, 17, has been studying in Singapore since last year. He had returned to Surabaya for year-end holidays and was due to start his new term at the St. Andrew's Junior College, said Linda, who has been with her niece since her return.

Chiara's father, Herumanto Tanus, was a 46-year-old accountant and Linda's youngest brother. Her mother, Indahju Liongsih, was a homemaker.

Chiara's younger brother, Justin Giovanni, was 9. Many Indonesians use one or two names but no family name.

""We are all heartbroken and Chiara still finds it hard to accept"" her family members' deaths, Linda said. ""I am thankful that the plane has been found. My only hope is that all their bodies will be found and evacuated no matter what the condition is so that we can have a proper closure.""

She said Chiara has agreed to eventually return to Singapore to study as she didn't want to disappoint her parents.

""In Singapore is her future,"" Linda said.

LIVING HER DREAM

Khairunnisa Haidar, 22, had always dreamed of becoming a flight attendant.

""We couldn't have stopped her,"" said her 60-year-old father, Haidar Fauzie. ""From the start, we already know the risks associated with flying.""

His wife cried hysterically when they heard the flight had gone missing.

They had been looking forward to their only daughter's return on Jan. 6.

Haidar said they had visited her apartment in Surabaya earlier and found that she had packed everything neatly in anticipation of her holiday back in Palembang, on the island of Sumatra, and also had booked her ticket home.

""She had asked my wife to make her favorite fruit pudding and a local vegetable samosa filled with carrots, potatoes and eggs,"" he said. He showed a photo of his daughter on his mobile phone, posing in her red AirAsia uniform in an aircraft. ""She is a filial, beautiful and smart daughter. It is a painful loss.""

Haidar said he was thankful for support from the airline and the government.

""It is a natural disaster. Nobody is to be blamed,"" he said. ""AirAsia is still the best.""

He was calm about his loss. ""We accept God's will. She belongs to the Almighty. We will see her again one day,"" he said, with a smile.

""MY ONLY SON""

The tragedy appears to have hit Surabaya's Christian community particularly hard.

Pastor Philip Mantofa of the Mawar Sharon Church in Surabaya was shocked to discover that 41 of the 162 passengers and crew were members of his church. He said it was it not unusual for many members to travel to Singapore for holidays.

More than 100 people gathered as Mantofa led a service of prayers and songs Wednesday at the Surabaya airport.

""Some things do not make sense to us but God is bigger than all this,"" he said.

Counselors from the church hugged and prayed for relatives, including Linca Gonimasela, who lost her 13-year-old son, Adrian Fernando.

It was supposed to be a fun trip to Singapore with his aunt, uncle and their 3-year-old daughter. All four were aboard the plane. Linca couldn't go on the trip as she had to work.

""He is my only son,"" she said. ""At first he didn't want to go but later on he was persuaded to join them for the New Year holidays.""

His family frequently flew to Singapore for vacations, and he had planned the trip as a special family trip for New Year's, according to his brother, Ifan Joko.

As work got busy toward year's end, Gunawan considered skipping the trip but in the end decided to stick with the family holiday.

""I know the plane has crashed but I'm still praying they are alive,"" Ifan said. ""As long as their bodies are not found, who knows?""

Gunawan liked to crack jokes, had many friends and often donated sacks of rejected clothing to the poor and needy, said a friend, Nasaruddin.

""He is a good man,"" Ifan said.

""Papa, come home, I still need you,"" Angela Anggi Ranastianis, the pilot's 22-year-old daughter, pleaded on the Path social-networking service late Sunday, which was widely quoted by Indonesian media. ""Bring back my papa. Papa, please come home.""

He was also respected in his community, which had appointed him neighborhood chief the last two years, said Bagianto Djoyonegoro, a friend and neighbor.

At Iryanto's house in the East Java town of Sidoarjo, neighbors, relatives and friends gathered earlier in the week to pray and recite the Quran to support the distraught family. Their desperate cries were so loud they could sometimes be heard outside where three LCD televisions had been set up to monitor the search for the plane.

A MOTHER-DAUGHTER OUTING

Just a week before the flight, accountant Lina Soetanto, 24, had surprised her mother, Ang Mie Jong, with vases of beautiful white roses for her 52nd birthday.

Ang suffered shoulder pain for months while Lina had a painful urinary tract infection, Ang's best friend Susilowati said.

They planned to go for medical check-ups at Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital and had saved up for the trip, she said. Ang had brought her 12-year-old niece Thurza Aureliza along with her for the trip.

""Indonesia is crying,"" said Pastor Hanny Lawantara of the Happy Family Center Church, which Lina attended.

SUCCESSFUL CAREER SHIFT

Throughout his career as an engineer for the energy company Total, Remi Plesel wanted to fly.

So a few years ago, the Frenchman quit his job and learned to do just that.

He got a job with AirAsia, and at the time of the accident he had earned 2,275 flying hours. He had been living in Indonesia three years, his sister, Renee, told France's RTL radio. She last had contact with him on Dec. 26.

""Aviation was his passion and he was able to make it real,"" she said. ""He told me that things were going well, that he'd had a good Christmas. He was happy. The rains were starting, the weather was bad, it was raining a lot. He was going to work the next day."""
303|India to track toilet use with tablets - Emirates 24|"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is launching a nationwide online programme to check whether people are using toilets as part of his cleanliness drive.

From this month, officials will head out with mobile phones, tablets and iPads to report on whether toilets are being used in rural India, with results uploaded onto a website in real time.

India's shortage of toilets costs the country more than $50 billion (Dh183.5bn) a year, mostly through premature deaths and hygiene-related diseases, according a World Bank study.

India suffers a greater cost than other Asian countries from the poor collection of human excreta, the study found."
304|Bad weather not likely to cause a plane crash, experts say|"Modern airplanes are built to withstand turbulence from dense thunderstorms, and it is rare for weather alone to cause a crash, say aviation experts.

“There is no reason why an airplane should not be able to fly through bad weather,” said Tom Bunn, a former military and commercial pilot and the author of a bestselling book on the fear of flying. He pointed out that there were six other planes in the same area as AirAsia’s Flight 8501 when it went missing.

“They flew through the same weather,” he said. “The weather should not have been an issue in a plane that didn’t malfunction.”

AirAsia’s Flight 8501, with 162 people on board, went off the radar on Sunday. The plane vanished halfway through a two-hour flight between Surabaya, Indonesia, and Singapore.

On Tuesday, search operations found pieces of the wreckage and bodies in the Java Sea, about 160 km from land and 10 km from the plane’s last known co-ordinates.

The plane’s flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders have yet to be recovered.

Flight 8501 had encountered storm clouds and was trying to navigate around those before it went missing. Reports say the captain had asked for permission to take the plane higher, away from the clouds.

The airplane was in an area near the equator known for thunderstorms.

Thunderstorms are among the riskier weather patterns pilots may face. They can stretch as high as 19,800 metres, well above the altitude ceiling of commercial airplanes.

Jock Williams, a retired fighter pilot and aviation expert, said the problem with thunderstorms is the air currents, “some of which are (going) up and some are going down. If you happen to get conflicting ones at the same time, and you do in thunderstorms, that can cause a tremendous amount of turbulence and that can put a strain on the plane.”

Thunderstorms, said Williams, do cause lightning, but serious accidents due to lightning strikes are rare.

Wind, and how it is behaving, directly affects how an airplane flies because the lift is created by the movement of air over the wings. Shifts in air pressure and wind speed can affect how much lift is created and sudden changes can force a plane to rise or fall.

But technology has come a long way and deals better with weather-related turbulence than it did before.

More and more airplanes are being equipped with on-board systems called Airborne Weather Avoidance Radar. This system is meant to allow pilots to avoid severe weather, not fly through it. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration recommends that pilots avoid heavy weather by at least 40 km.

There are over 100,000 flights every day worldwide and airplanes fly through bad weather regularly without incident.

Bunn, meanwhile, draws a chilling comparison between the AirAsia disaster and the Air France flight that crashed in the Atlantic Ocean while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in June 2009, killing all 228 people on board.

“It appears this is a replay of Air France 447 (from) five years ago when the airspeed system malfunctioned. In a computerized plane like the Airbus, the computers, and the operation of the plane, are dependent upon good information.”"
305|Argentina President Cristina Fernandez to allow passengers to carry lapdogs on flights, Americas News & Top Stories|"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine President Cristina Fernandez chose an unexpected theme for her year-end message to the country: a change in policy at the state-run airline to allow passengers to carry their already notoriously pampered lapdogs with them on flights.

Punctuated by photographs on her Facebook page of the two-term leader sitting on presidential plane Tango 01 with her Toy Poodle Lolita, Ms Fernandez said the perk will be shared by travelers on Aerolineas Argentinas, the country's main carrier, starting in mid January.

""Careful! I said only small pets,"" the post says. ""Don't try to board with a 50kg mastiff. Lolita only weighs 2kg.""

Hand-held pooches ranging from Shih Tzu's to Pugs are a common sight at outdoor cafes and on the wide avenues of Buenos Aires, which is known as the Paris of South America for its European layout and architecture.

Lapdogs are a status symbol in Argentina, dressed sometimes in fitted sweaters emblazoned with colors of their owners'favorite soccer club. Fernandez's dog post got more than 36,000 'likes'.

What Argentines are less keen on, and what got no mention in Ms Fernandez's message, was the country's double-digit inflation and contracting gross domestic product.

Her successor will inherit a pet-friendly airline policy but an economy left in deep trouble by repeated sovereign debt defaults and heavy-handed trade and currency controls.

As an afterthought, Ms Fernandez said central bank cash reserves rose 2.7 per cent in 2014, which could keep her from being forced into an unpalatable deal with hedge funds suing over defaulted bonds. ""Oh yes, I almost forgot, we've come to US$31.4 billion (S$41.5 billion) in central bank reserves,"" the post says.

The next president will be elected in October, so Lolita better make the most of the time she has left to enjoy the spacious Tango 01. Ms Fernandez is constitutionally barred from seeking a third-consecutive term."
306|Business Recorder|"ICTs in 2014

2014 was a largely positive year as far as Pakistan's ICT industry is concerned. However, there were a number of areas which could have performed well. Let's look at both the events and non-events that took place during the year. Firstly, let's look at the ""C"" in ICT that is telecommunications.



Telecoms The long-pending 3G spectrum auction took place in April 2014. On top of four 3G licenses to four operators, the telecom authorities were also able to auction one 4G license. So, Pakistan simultaneously launched 3G and 4G services in the country this year after a long wait. 3G and 4G network rollouts are currently underway and high-speed mobile internet is now available in a number of major cities and some second-tier towns. As the year closed out, Warid Telecom, the only operator which didn't take part in the spectrum auction, announced launch of LTE services on its existing network. After that, consumers now have a choice between two 4G service providers.



There were 4.96 million 3G subscribers and 1,452 4G subscribers as of November end. These numbers are expected to grow manifold in 2015. Thanks to the auction, telecom investment also picked up during the year. As per PTA's statistics, FDI in telecom sector jumped from negative $408 million in FY13 to $903 million in FY14. Overall telecom investment - which includes local equity and debt-financing - had reached $1.8 billion, about four times the level seen in FY13. Telecommunications industry, particularly the mobile broadband networks, is helping raise the country's FDI inflows. In the FYTD, too, 35 percent of the overall net FDI of $423 million had been sourced by the telecom industry. More FDI is expected to come in rest of FY15 as well.



During the year, the Ministry of IT and Telecom (MoIT) showed progress on another pending issue: telecom sector policy framework, which had expired in 2008. The MoIT had issued a draft framework in July this year, sought the market feedback, incorporated the same, and released the tweaked document one more time in October for final consultation. The framework was expected to be released in December; but now it seems it will likely be released early this year. It is hoped that the new framework will address key industry issues like spectrum availability, infrastructure sharing, right-of-way rules, etc.



The long-distance and international (LDI) telephony has seen its ups and downs in recent years. It is widely believed that a sustainable LDI business is only possible if the government reduces super-taxes such as the access promotion charge (APC) and goes after illegal telecom gateways and exchanges. During the year, telecom authorities seemed to get a better sense of the issue and stepped up their efforts. On one hand, surveillance of unscrupulous operators and exchanges was tightened as the authorities conducted raids and busted such establishments. On the other, the controversial International Clearing House (ICH) regime, which severely divided the industry on its pros and cons for genuine LDI business, was abandoned in 2014. Moreover, the APC was reportedly under the scrutiny with the intention to bring it down to zero. That's the right course to take, and one hopes, it will see some concrete action in 2015.



Other than these positive and major developments, the year 2014 left a lot to be realised. For one, the federal government, encouraged by the outdated policy framework, is still sitting tight on the billions of rupees that belong to the Universal Service Fund (USF) Company, which undertakes ICT infrastructure development of unserved and underserved districts of Pakistan. The USF needs administrative and financial independence, as originally envisaged, to be able to perform its role. Right now the pace of disbursements is slow because of internal organisational structure as well as external government influence. Critically-needed projects like optic fiber and broadband penetration to rural areas demand a fast-track process of USF contracts and disbursements, all done in a transparent manner.



The government did try to bring telecom-consumption-related taxes down a notch in 2014. In the federal budget for 2014-15, the government announced a 1 percent cut in withholding tax to 14 percent and a 1 percent cut in GST to 18.5 percent in areas of Balochistan, Fata, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Islamabad. These cuts are welcome but they are miniscule and do not apply to much of Pakistan. Taxes on account recharge and airtime usage are still very high. Pakistan ranks amongst the heaviest-taxed countries in terms of telecom's total cost of ownership. Considering the ongoing rollout of a completely new service (mobile broadband), whose mass adoption needs, among other things, some tax relief on airtime consumption, taxes must be brought down significantly in order to boost usage.



The long-running YouTube ban was expected to be lifted last year. However, despite government assurances to rights organisations and courts, the popular video-sharing and hosting platform remains blocked in Pakistan, much to the detriment of the learning community, artists, and entrepreneurs. It has been nearly two and a half years that the ban is in place, and may remain in place in 2015. The legislation on the draft Prevention of Electronic Crimes Bill is also pending. The bill is likely to be cleared this year in the wake of rising online and social media use in the context of terrorism, gender harassment, and extortion.



Information Technology



In order to boost IT exports and encourage local IT firms to remit most of their revenues back home, the Pakistan Software Export Board and the MoIT have reportedly finalised a plan. In a graduated manner, the plan will provide for a lower GST levy on IT hardware import machinery for IT firms that remit more of their overseas sales or profits back home. Officials believe that many IT firms are only declaring a third of their real software exports. The tax break on corporate profits of software exporters is expiring in June 2016. The renewal of the exemption will require legislation, work on which is reportedly underway.



2014 saw many local, tech-enabled start-ups to rise and shine. Pakistan's growing information technology-centered entrepreneurship ecosystem - with amazing businesses operating in online marketplaces, local-manufactured-and-branded products, and social-impact products - has made folks here and abroad to take notice. Graduates of incubators at organisations like the Plan9, i2i, and LCE have successfully mobilised international funding during the year. The momentum is expected to continue in 2015, with more quality start-ups rising and more international VCs taking exposure in this market.



National Broadband Policy



All forms of connectivity today are underpinned by broadband: fixed and wireless both. Telecom authorities and market leaders need to take a step back and rethink the old of making isolated policies for different telecom segments. Such policies worked well back in the 2000's. But now it's time to converge towards a holistic broadband policy framework that takes a 360-degree approach and includes both fixed and wireless solutions based on the scalability principle. Wireless solutions may work in the cities but are not so practical for rural areas, which need fiber optic coverage first.



Remember, ICTs are the enablers, not the decisive factors. Broadband can be the means to exact social change and economic renewal, but alone it will not suffice. The country first needs to have many more people with broadband access. Then, areas need to be identified, such as education, healthcare, agriculture, m-governance, etc for development policies to work well using ICTs. 2015 can be the year when a solid ICT foundation is laid out. For that, all stakeholders need to sit together and agree on an ambitious broadband-density timeline and ""useful connectivity"" mandates. That's the starting point.

307|Futures Pointing To Modestly Higher Open On Wall Street|"While trading activity is likely to be somewhat subdued, stocks may move to the upside at the start of trading on Wednesday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a modestly higher open for the , with the Dow futures up by 16 points.

The upward momentum for the markets comes on the heels of the pullback that was seen in the previous session, which reflected concerns about weakness overseas.

Nonetheless, many traders are likely to be away from their desks today, getting a head start on the New Year's Eve festivities.

A report from the Labor Department showing a bigger than expected increase in initial jobless claims may also limit any early upside for the markets.

The Labor Department said jobless claims climbed to 298,000 in the week ended December 27th, an increase of 17,000 from the previous week's revised level of 281,000.

Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 290,000 from the 280,000 originally reported for the previous week.

Not long after the open, trading could be impacted by the release of reports on Chicago-area activity and pending home sales.

308|What we learned in F1 in 2014|"The Crash.net team in the F1 paddock brings you an alternative edition of what we learned in the 2014 season from a more personal point of view...



Nobody knows anything, really



While this year's Japanese Grand Prix will not be remembered fondly, the action off-track was intense before the race itself. On Friday night Crash.net was one of many news outlets chasing news that Fernando Alonso would leave Ferrari, and was told by a very reliable source that it was a done deal and that Sebastian Vettel was Ferrari's target, with Daniil Kvyat set to get the nod to replace Vettel if he leaves Red Bull.



With the focus on Alonso, Crash.net spoke to Jenson Button about it late on Friday evening and told him what was expected. With a wry smile he said: “I think it's going to be a very exciting few weeks and then nothing will change”.



The following morning, Red Bull announced Vettel's departure and Kvyat's promotion, with Christian Horner also confirming Ferrari was Vettel's destination. Later in the day, a surprised Button admitted the news was completely unexpected for him but said he had been told Alonso would end up “in a silver car but not a McLaren”.



He wasn't alone in that belief, but now they sit together as team-mates at Woking…



Shanghai kicks Jiading's arse



Travelling the world with F1 is something of a learning process - where to stay, when to fly in and out, no one gets it all right their first season. Or their second, third, or even fourth…



Because China can be a difficult place to navigate - particularly when lacking the necessary language skills - when the organisers of the Shanghai race email round lists of discounted media hotels close to the track in the northwestern Jiading District - and with a free shuttle service - most of us jump and book as instructed.



Having had something of a nightmare with the media hotels in 2013 (bathrooms are not supposed to rain indoors, let alone rain every night), it was Shanghai or bust for 2014. Cue a five-star hotel in the centre of town for the same price as the soggy media hotel in the sticks, and a weekend spent discovering the delights of Shanghai as a place to party. The only downside? Shanghai traffic made for a very long commute. Still worth it.



Monaco's glamour stops at Mirabeau



The Monaco Grand Prix was one dominated by Nico Rosberg's mistake at Mirabeau in qualifying, but the very same corner was one I found symbolic for other reasons this season.



As you can imagine, Monaco is a very expensive place to stay during grand prix week, and as a result a group of four of us journalist-types crammed in to a studio apartment just across the border in Beausoleil in order to be able to afford to stay somewhere from which we could walk down to the track each day.



While the glitz and glamour of the harbour was true, to avoid the crowds many a cheap pizza was had in an Irish bar just beyond Mirabeau – closer to Portier in all honesty – and all that awaited from that point were stairs and elevators up to Beausoleil. The walk wasn't one to be sniffed at (you're getting to cover the Monaco Grand Prix, after all) but only if you remembered a photographer's tabard which would allow you to walk trackside…



The one day I left my bag in the media centre – tabard and all – I had to walk for an hour taking in numerous staircases, the station, countless tunnels and underpasses, and all with fans who had to do that on a daily basis to get a glimpse of track action. As a fan, I'd save my money and do two different European rounds for the same price instead.



First class ain't worth the extra cash



One of the highlights of the 2014 season from a travel point of view was supposed to be a first class flight on an Airbus A380, and the chance to live like a king for 14 hours in the sky.



And while there was nothing to complain about in the level of service (or the quality of the endless champagne and caviar that I kept accidentally reordering…), it turns out that Emirates are just so damn good at treating you like a queen in business class that there's really nowhere for them to go when it comes to improving the treatment for first class passengers. Sexy brown complimentary pyjamas aside, of course.



There's no logic in turning down the chance to fly first if someone else is paying. In an A380 you get the semi-private cabin experience thanks to those closing doors, and the opportunity to have a shower in the sky is not to be sniffed at. The first class lounge is sensational, and includes its own duty free to save one from hob-nobbing with the hoi polloi, but for three times the price of business it's not three times the experience.



In fact, the real highlight of the trip came when we were disembarking, and I scanned the cabin and realised I could legitimately - and chastely - claim to have slept with several drivers.



Russia will be better in 2015



Sounds obvious, but not only will the Russian Grand Prix be better next season, it needs to be.



This year's race was doomed before it even started. Focus on the political implications of racing in Russia amid the Ukraine crisis ensured that almost every headline about the grand prix was negative in the build-up to the inaugural race. Then came Jules Bianchi's accident in Japan, and the F1 paddock arrived in Sochi under a cloud.



That was a tough situation for Russian journalists and fans. Excited about F1 finally arriving in their country, the journalists spent Thursday wishing to ask the drivers about their thoughts on the track and country, but were met with solemn – and sometimes snappy – responses from people with thoughts elsewhere.



Then came the race itself, which made Luca Badoer's F1 career look spectacular. The grand prix was so dull that two separate local journalists fell asleep in the media centre; the kind of proper, deep sleep that leaves you catching flies.



It seemed the drivers couldn't wait to get home, many flying together on Sunday night and being criticised (unfairly) for posting an image of them all enjoying a drink at the end of a tough few weeks. And that criticism was for the sober version of the photo…



As always, let us know what you learned – serious or tongue-in-cheek – over 2014 in the comments section below. Thanks for your interaction and Happy New Year to all Crash.net readers from the F1 team.

King Abdullah International Center for Arabic Language Services and the Asian Chapter of the World Association of Humanitarian Organizations were in discussions to establish centres to provide some language skills to Indians before they moved to GCC states.

Indians make up the largest expatriate populations in the Gulf, and in some countries there are more Indians than nationals, however few can speak the local language.

The new president of the Asian Chapter of the World Association of Humanitarian Organizations Hussein Madavoor said knowledge of Arabic would help bridge the communication gap between some employers and employees.

He said poor communication caused many of the labour issues.

“Such communication will also help for an effective cultural exchange between Arabs and non-Arabs living in this part of the world,” he was quoted as saying.

“Such centres already exist in China, Japan and Korea while the UK is also planning to run these training programs.”

The first centre is expected to open in the Indian capital New Delhi in 2015."

Mr Kofi Portuphy, National Chairman of National Democratic Congress, on Wednesday said the celebration of the 31st December revolution is still relevant despite the fact that it took place 33 years ago.

He said marking of the event always help the public especially political leaders to reflect soberly on principles of probity and accountability which was the main theme of the revolution.

Mr Portuphy said this at the wreath laying ceremony to mark the 33rd anniversary of the revolution at the Revolution Square in Accra.

He said the revolution which occurred on December 31, 1981 finally led to the birth of the 1992 constitution which has helped to entrench Ghana’s democracy.

“The 1992 constitution of Ghana, the free speech and our governance system were all made possible after the 31st revolution and it is imperative that such an occasion is always remembered,” he said.

He urged government to help strengthen the Ghana Armed Forces by providing them with the needed resources to enable them protect the democratic rule.

He also called on public officials to always reflect soberly on the principles of probity and accountability and desist from corrupt act.

319|New Yorkers brave frigid temps for New Year's Eve|"NEW YORK — About one million excited partygoers have braved the cold and packed themselves tightly into New York City’s Times Square, listening to performances from artists such as Idina Menzel, O.A.R. and Meghan Trainor before the famed glittering ball drops at midnight.

Thousands of revelers arrived early Wednesday morning at the Crossroads of the World to secure coveted spots with pristine views of the 11,875-pound Waterford crystal ball perched high atop 1 World Trade for the annual New Year's Eve celebration.

“This was on my bucket list,” said MacKynze Slatinsky, 15, who traveled with her sister and best friend from Monroe, Michigan, to bring in 2015 in New York, arriving at 10:30 a.m. to land a spot with a view on 44th Street. “It’s really crowded and cold but what a great experience.”

Temperatures in the 50s just days earlier plunged to freezing as the new year approached.

Just hours away from midnight, the National Weather Service said it was 30 degrees in midtown Manhattan.

Ryan Seacrest was hosting the countdown show, with Taylor Swift, Florida Georgia Line and Magic! among the musical guests. When the clock strikes midnight and the ball drops, so will 1 ton of confetti containing well wishes for the upcoming year.

Best friends Allie Casertino and Melanie Catone traveled from nearby Glen Falls, New York, to watch the celebration, wearing extra layers, hats and gloves.

“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” said Casertino, 16. “We had to come.”

Security was tight and police say department officials said they started planning for the Times Square ball drop just hours after the clock struck midnight, ushering in 2014.

Thousands of police officers were on scene, with rooftop patrols and police helicopters protecting the crowd, along with the bomb squad and a unit specializing in chemical and biological threats sweeping hotels, theaters, construction sites and parking garages.

Police Commissioner William Bratton said there had been no specific threats directed against Times Square.

The celebration came in a city facing more demonstrations against police brutality even as it mourns the deaths of two officers shot in their patrol car by a man who vowed online to kill “pigs.” A march from Union Square north as close to Times Square as possible was planned for Wednesday evening. Police said they had prepared for protests and were on heightened alert. Since the shootings, authorities have investigated at least 70 threats made against police officers, and 16 people have been arrested.

But none of that seemed to weigh on revelers Wednesday night, who donned goofy hats and noise makers, jumping up-and-down to stay warm.

Agustina Bernacchia, a tourist from Argentina, said she arrived early at Times Square to experience the New Year's Eve party she’d always seen on TV.

“It was a dream for us,” she said."
320|Google Gives Itself Top Billing for Song Lyric Searches|"Monetizing music. That's likely the objective behind Google's latest search engine moves, which now pop up song lyrics at the top of relevant search inquiries. While many other sites and thousands of YouTube videos have been providing easy online access to song lyrics for years, Google can obviously leverage the behemoth power of its search engine to provide its own results first -- then linking to its own sources, such as the Google Play store, to sell you the tunes.

The news emerged last week in a short Google Plus post by Glenn Gabe, Digital Marketing Consultant at G-Squared Interactive. ""The hammer has fallen. Google now displaying lyrics in the SERPs (search engine results pages),"" Gabe said.

Gabe's post included a sample result showing the page that appears if you're searching for the term ""mollys chambers lyrics."" The first item to show up at the top of Google's results page includes the complete lyrics to the song by Kings of Leon.

'Makes You Wonder'

Indeed, older music fans will remember 'back in the day' when it was nearly impossible to find song lyrics if they weren't included with albums. That trouble lay behind countless misunderstood lyrics, including the classic -- ""'Scuse me while I kiss this guy"" -- which was really Jimi Hendrix singing ""'Scuse me while I kiss the sky"" in the song ""Purple Haze."" Not to mention the cryptically interpreted lyrics from AC/DC's ""thirty thieves and the thunder chief,"" which of course was always meant to be ""dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.""

While the new search functionality is live, Google isn't yet consistent with the results it returns. For example, a search for the aforementioned ""Purple Haze"" didn't return a set of lyrics, although it did include links to Web sites that have published the words to the song. The same held true in a search for AC/DC's ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"" lyrics.

""Google began quietly rolling out lyrics at the top of results pages last week, but only for certain songs that have been licensed from music publishers, with more expected soon,"" according to an ArtsBeat article published today in the New York Times.

The article noted, for example, that lyrics appear in a search for Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" but not for the Bruce Springsteen classic, ""Born in the U.S.A."" It added that Google had confirmed the new search feature with a ""playful statement"": ""There's a feeling you get when you turn to a song and you know that the words have two meanings. Well it's whispered that now if you go search the tune, maybe Google will lead you to reason. Ooh, it makes you wonder . . .""

Lyrics in 'Legal Gray Area'

In response to comments on his Google Plus post, Gabe noted that ""there's a lot they (Google) can do to monetize lyrics. And I expect that to happen, sooner than later. :)""

And it does appear that it will be be sooner: ""When they do appear, the words come complete with a link to the company's Google Play store, where the tracks can be purchased,"" according to the New York Times.

After decades of languishing in a ""legal gray area,"" song lyrics appear to finally be making their way into a more easily accessed -- and monetized -- position, according to the New York Times.

In fact, Microsoft 's search engine, Bing, launched its new ""lyrics experience,"" in early October. The feature enables users to ""view full lyrics for your favorite song on the mainline search results page, without having to click through to a third party site or spend time figuring out which blue link on the page will yield good quality lyrics."""

322|Putin sends New Year's message to Obama|"MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in a New Year's message to U.S. President Barack Obama that Moscow is looking for equality in bilateral relations next year.

The Kremlin on Wednesday published several dozen New Year's messages addressed to heads of states and international organizations such as the Olympic Committee and FIFA.

Putin reminded Obama of the upcoming 70th anniversary of the allied victory in World War II and said that it should serve as a reminder of ""the responsibility that Russia and the United States bear for maintaining peace and international stability."" Moscow is anxious for the relations to advance but only as long as there is ""equality and mutual respect.""

Blasphemy charges are on the rise in some countries, and often for incidents that cause harm to draconian sensitivities.—Illustration by Faraz Aamer Khan

Almost a quarter of the countries in the world punish blasphemy. Research by Pew indicates that while laws restricting blasphemy are found in several countries (including in Europe), they are most common in the Muslim world and unsurprisingly, the notion of blasphemy or “offending religion” also continues to be a particularly sensitive issue in parts of the Muslim world.

In December, a man belonging to the Ahmadi community was shot dead, for no apparent reason, in Pakistan allegedly after religious and media personalities incited hatred against members of that community – a people who have often found themselves accused of blasphemy by the very exercise of practicing their belief.

Earlier that month, in Indonesia, the editor of the prominent newspaper, the Jakarta Post, had been summoned for questioning by the police on blasphemy charges, for publishing a cartoon.

While readers will be quite familiar with the design and application of the blasphemy law in Pakistan and also the sudden spike in the extrajudicial killings carried out to punish alleged blasphemy, this article briefly touches upon the blasphemy laws of three Muslim majority countries which sit in different parts of the world, all of which privilege religion in their national constitution.

It also highlights a worrying trend: blasphemy related charges are on the rise in some countries, and often, for incidents that probably cause more harm to draconian sensitivities and the free exercise of religion than for any, real, tangible or identifiable harm to an individual or group.

While blasphemy laws in themselves need not by design inhibit rights and can have an ostensible purpose of securing public order, in practice, their application has often robbed individuals of precisely the sort of rights that would exist in any state that aspires to become a pluralistic democracy (which does not necessarily mean “secular”).

Indonesia is the most populous democracy in the Muslim world. Its constitution does not privilege a particular religion but refers to “God”; in 1965, it enacted a “blasphemy law”, which makes it a criminal offense to deviate from or defame one of the six recognised religions; it also punishes non-religious belief, making it an offence to “...not practice any religion at all that is based on belief in Almighty God.” The maximum punishment is five years imprisonment. There are also similar provisions “protecting religion” in other laws in Indonesia.

In practice, blasphemy was rarely prosecuted in the country. However, Amnesty International reports that the number of blasphemy convictions” skyrocketed” during former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s decade in power (2004-2014).

It recorded at least 106 individuals who were prosecuted and convicted under the blasphemy laws for offences ranging from expressing atheist beliefs on Facebook to believing and preaching that the current Quran was not the original one revealed.

In 2009-2010 several NGO’s bought proceedings in the Constitutional Court to challenge the validity of the law by arguing that it contravened the constitutional right to freedom of religion, but failed to have the law overturned.

Saudi Arabia is ranked as having the second most “Islamic” constitution in the Muslim world in the Islamic Constitutions Index.

Its blasphemy laws are not clearly accessible (partly because the country claims to base its “laws” on the wholesale adoption of Shariah rather than legislation); there is no formal criminal code but yet the government has used charges of blasphemy against persons seeking to debate the role of religion in relation to the state, as well as promoters of political and human rights reforms.

The USCIRF alleges that the Saudi government has “used criminal charges of apostasy and blasphemy to suppress discussion and debate and silence dissidents. Promoters of political and human rights reforms, and those seeking to debate the role of religion in relation to the state, its laws, and society, typically have been the targets of”.

For example, a person who started a blog discussing religion, politics and other topics in Saudi Arabia was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. The blasphemy law was deployed to silence him; he was charged with insulting Islam. In 2011, an Australian Muslim was charged with blasphemy while he performed the Hajj; he had allegedly insulted the companions of the Prophet. There may certainly be other less known but similar incidents which have not made it in the press. It is hard to get an idea of the trend in blasphemy charges in the Kingdom but one would imagine that with recent expressions of political freedom, the number convicted may not have dwindled.

Iran is ranked as having the most Islamic constitution in the Muslim world. The Penal Code stipulates that blasphemy against the prophets, Shia imams and/or the religious leadership is punishable by imprisonment, unless it is classified as against the Prophet, when it can be punishable by death.

Indeed, blasphemy can be charged under a range of offenses, such as “spreading corruption on earth,” (which is apparently an unpardonable offence and can include acts deemed undesirable by the state), insulting religious sanctities, insulting Islam, criticising the Islamic regime, or deviating from Islamic standards.

In November, an Iranian man was sentenced to death for “insulting the Prophet of Islam” for Facebook posts deemed offensive to the Prophet. Other examples include three years for a Shia history professor and Iran-Iraq War veteran who called for political reforms and 11 years imprisonment — for a senior Shia cleric who advocated greater separation of religion and the state. Bahai’s, Christians, and Sunni and Sufi Muslims, as well as Shia Muslim dissidents and journalists are often the targets of the blasphemy law.

Blasphemy laws do not have to be damaging to rights and conversely; the lack of a law punishing blasphemy does not mean a country has lost all respect for religion.

That is, democracies that respect religion do not necessarily need to impinge on freedoms.

Nevertheless, while intolerance is not unique to Muslim countries and is in fact, also rising in “secular” Europe, these incidents and cases portend a warning: intolerance and authoritarianism masquerading as blasphemy is becoming more prevalent – and for all the wrong reasons – in parts of the Muslim world and this can do little but erode democratic ambitions.

326|Bodies and debris from the lost AirAsia plane pulled from sea|"Indonesian rescuers searching for an AirAsia plane carrying 162 people pulled bodies and wreckage from the sea off the coast of Borneo yesterday, prompting relatives of those on board watching TV footage to break down in tears.

Indonesia AirAsia’s Flight QZ8501, an Airbus A320-200, lost contact with air traffic control early on Sunday during bad weather on a flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.

The navy said 40 bodies had been recovered. The plane has yet to be found.

“My heart is filled with sadness for all the families involved in QZ8501,” airline boss Tony Fernandes tweeted. “On behalf of AirAsia, my condolences to all. Words cannot express how sorry I am.”

The airline said in a statement that it was inviting family members to Surabaya, “where a dedicated team of care providers will be assigned to each family to ensure that all of their needs are met”.

Pictures of floating bodies were broadcast on television and relatives of the missing already gathered at a crisis centre in Surabaya wept with heads in their hands. Several people collapsed in grief and were helped away.

“You have to be strong,” the mayor of Surabaya, Tri Rismaharini, said as she comforted relatives. “They are not ours, they belong to God.”

A navy spokesman said a plane door, oxygen tanks and one body had been recovered and taken away by helicopter for tests.

My heart is filled with sadness - airline boss says

“The challenge is waves up to three metres high,” Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo, head of the Search and Rescue Agency, told reporters, adding that the search operation would go on all night. He declined to answer questions on whether any survivors had been found.

About 30 ships and 21 aircraft from Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and the United States have been involved in the search.

The plane, which did not issue a distress signal, disappeared after its pilot failed to get permission to fly higher to avoid bad weather because of heavy air traffic, officials said.

It was travelling at 32,000 feet (9,753 metres) and had asked to fly at 38,000 feet, officials said earlier.

Pilots and aviation experts said thunderstorms, and requests to gain altitude to avoid them, were not unusual in that area.

The Indonesian pilot was experienced and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, the airline said.

The aircraft had accumulated about 23,000 flight hours in some 13,600 flights, according to Airbus.

Online discussion among pilots has centred on unconfirmed secondary radar data from Malaysia that suggested the aircraft was climbing at a speed of 353 knots, about 100 knots too slow, and that it might have stalled.

The plane, whose engines were made by CFM International, co-owned by General Electric and Safran of France, lacked real-time engine diagnostics or monitoring, a GE spokesman said.

Such systems are mainly used on long-haul flights and can provide clues to airlines and investigators when things go wrong.

Three airline disasters involving Malaysian-affiliated carriers in less than a year have dented confidence in the country’s aviation industry and spooked travellers across the region.

Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 went missing on March 8 on a trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board and has not been found. On July 17, the same airline’s Flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.

Bizarrely, an AirAsia plane from Manila skidded off and overshot the runway on landing at Kalibo in the central Philippines yesterday. No one was hurt.

On board Flight QZ8501 were 155 Indonesians, three South Koreans, and one person each from Singapore, Malaysia and Britain. The co-pilot was French.

US law enforcement and security officials said passenger and crew lists were being examined but nothing significant had turned up and the incident was regarded as an unexplained accident.

Indonesia AirAsia is 49 per cent owned by Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia.

The AirAsia group, including affiliates in Thailand, the Philippines and India, had not suffered a crash since its Malaysian budget operations began in 2002."
327|Holder Calls Police Fatalities 'Troubling,' Vows 'Unshakeable Commitment'|"Photo by Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images(WASHINGTON) — Attorney General Eric Holder called the data released Tuesday on law enforcement fatalities for 2014 “troubling,” adding that the figures “underscore the very real dangers that America’s brave law enforcement officers face every time they put on their uniforms.”

The report found that 126 federal, state, local, tribal and territorial officers were killed in the line of duty in 2014, and that 50 were killed by firearms. Both of those figures were higher in 2014 than in 2013.

Holder on Tuesday spoke about the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program and the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Program, both of which are efforts headed by the Department of Justice to help provide lifesaving equipment and support to law enforcement officers and their families.

“Going forward, this unshakeable commitment to those who serve will continue to guide our efforts to improve 21st-century policing and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they protect,” Holder said.

329|Ask a Lawyer: DUI checkpoints - Are they legal and what are your rights?|"They go by a number of different names: DUI checkpoints, administrative roadblocks, mobile checkpoints, or as they are referred to by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, sobriety checkpoints. No matter the title, they all have the same effect: to allow the police to stop your vehicle for no articulable reason, ask for your license and registration, and ask you questions such as, “Where are coming from?” “Where are you going?” and — most importantly — “Have you been drinking?”

Under normal circumstances, an officer cannot stop your vehicle and ask you questions unless you have committed a traffic offense or the officer has a reasonable suspicion that you are engaged in some type of criminal behavior. This right we all have against “unreasonable seizures” is deeply embedded in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

However, the United States Supreme Court decided in the case of Michigan v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990), that a DUI roadblock, while in fact a “seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,” and therefore a constitutional violation of an individual right, was reasonable. The court utilized a “balancing test” and determined that the slight intrusion motorists experience at a checkpoint is outweighed by the “State’s interest in preventing drunken driving.”

Consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court Opinion, Nevada law allows police officers to set up sobriety checkpoints, referred to in the statute as an “administrative road block,” with specific requirements that the officers must follow.

Under Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 484.B570, the following must be completed for the roadblock to be constitutional:

The roadblock must be clearly visible to approaching traffic for a distance of at least 100 yards in either direction. A sign must be placed at the center line of the road displaying the word “Stop” at not less than 50 yards from the administrative roadblock. At least one red flashing light must be at the side of the roadway, clearly visible to oncoming traffic at a distance of at least 100 yards.

The above requirements that indicate that a road block is ahead allow the driver to opt out of driving through the checkpoint, as long as there exists a legal turn the driver can make onto another street. Most people think that as they approach a sobriety checkpoint, they must continue straight into the lanes associated with the narrowing of traffic until they are inevitably met by the officer ready to question them. However, the statute does not require a driver who is approaching a sobriety checkpoint to continue into it, if a legal turn can be made. If you are late for an event (because most sobriety checkpoints are during holidays) or simply do not feel like waiting in a long, slow-moving line of cars, you are within your rights to make any legal turn onto another roadway.

It is extremely important to understand that while you are permitted to make a lawful turn before arriving at the roadblock, failing to stop at a sobriety checkpoint (i.e. driving right through) is a crime. So, once you are in the line of cars that are going through the checkpoint and a legal, alternative route no longer exists, you must comply with the officer at the end of your lane. Proceeding through the checkpoint without stopping and disobeying the lawful orders and/or direction of the police officer handling your lane is a gross misdemeanor which is punishable up to 1 year in prison. (NRS 484B.580).

When your vehicle approaches the officer, he or she can either waive you through or order you to stop and lower your window and ask you a series of questions. If after asking you questions the officer suspects that you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or if the officer suspects any criminal activity (possession of drug paraphernalia, warrants, traffic citations, etc.), then you will be instructed to proceed to a nearby area for further testing or processing.

What is interesting to note is that the state of Nevada and the Metropolitan Police Department recognize that stopping an automobile without probable cause or a reasonable suspicion that the driver has committed an offense can be considered a government intrusion.

Not only did the Nevada Legislature require the police to provide citizens with sufficient warning that the checkpoint is ahead through the use of flashing lights and signage, but Las Vegas police themselves have adopted some of the recommendations of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA) regarding checkpoints. One of the more notable recommendations is that police departments publicize their impaired driving efforts by announcing their intentions to conduct sobriety checkpoints in advance. Metro follows this recommendation by announcing checkpoints on its website.

Remember - this article is written for law abiding citizens and no one who chooses to drive while intoxicated should attempt to evade detection. According to the NHSTA, one alcohol-related crash fatality occurs every 33 minutes. With that staggering statistic, there is no question that drunk driving is a very serious and often deadly issue. Any intoxicated driver presents a danger to us all – and a sobriety checkpoint furthers the interests of stopping those illegal drivers from harming other citizens.

My advice is one of zero tolerance - driving after any consumption of alcohol is a risk to your own freedom and safety. Taking a taxicab home or getting a ride from a friend is certainly better than spending the night in jail, the hospital or the morgue.

In sum, whether it be New Year’s Eve, Memorial Day, Labor Day, or any other holiday, you can expect to see sobriety checkpoints conducted by the Metropolitan Police Department throughout the Las Vegas Valley. Be cautious and do not drink and drive.

You rise from the ground

Elegance restrained.

Always on duty

You should be crowned,

For having entertained

Us QLers with your beauty.

332|Pictures of floating AirAsia victims shock family members|"REUTERS OVERWHELMED: Family members of missing passengers burst into tears and comfort each other on hearing that bodies were spotted by the Indonesian navy.

JAKARTA: Grim scenes on television as Indonesian rescuers searching for an AirAsia plane carrying 162 people pulled bodies and wreckage from the sea off the coast of Borneo yesterday caused relatives to break down in tears.

Pilots and aviation experts said thunderstorms, and requests to gain altitude to avoid them, were not unusual in that area.

The Indonesian pilot was experienced and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, the airline said.

The aircraft had accumulated about 23 000 flight hours in some 13 600 flights, according to Airbus.

Online discussion among pilots has centered on unconfirmed secondary radar data from Malaysia that suggested the aircraft was climbing at a speed of 353 knots, about 100 knots too slow, and that it might have stalled.

The plane, whose engines were made by CFM International, co-owned by General Electric (GE) and Safran of France, lacked real-time engine diagnostics or monitoring, a GE spokesman said.

Three airline disasters involving Malaysian-affiliated carriers in less than a year have dented confidence in the country’s aviation industry and spooked travellers across the region. – Reuters"
333|Blast strikes Houthi ceremony in Yemen, 23 killed|"World Bulletin / News Desk

A bomber blew himself up at a Shiite Houthi gathering in Yemen's central Ibb province on Wednesday, amid reports about casualties.

""A bomber blew himself up inside the cultural center in the Ibb city as Houthis were holding a ceremony to mark the birth of Islam's prophet,"" a security source told The Anadolu Agency.

They said at least 23 bodies, including women and children, had been transferred to two hospitals in the city of Ibb.

The governor of Ibb province, controlled by the Shi'ite Muslim Houthi group that dominates Yemen, was reported to be among a number of people wounded in the attack, local residents said.

In a text message, the state Saba news agency cited the head of Ibb's police as saying three people had died and 30 had been wounded.

Residents reported there was a second explosion outside one of the two hospitals, al-Thawra. No details were immediately available or if there were casualties.

Security forces sealed off the area following the blast, the source said.

There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack.

Police officer shot dead

Meanwhile, a police officer was shot dead on Wednesday in Yemen's southern Shabwah province, a local official has said.

""Unidentified gunmen on a motorbike opened fire on a traffic officer in provincial capital Ataq, killing him instantly,"" the official, requesting anonymity, told The Anadolu Agency.

There has been no claim of responsibility, while the Yemeni authorities have yet to comment on the incident.

Yemen has been dogged by turmoil since pro-democracy protests forced autocratic president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down in 2012 after 33 years in power.

In recent months, scores of security personnel have been killed in attacks in the country's south, for which officials point the finger at Al-Qaeda-linked militants.

Politically fractious Yemen has recently appeared on the verge of civil war, with members of the powerful Shiite Houthi group seeking to expand their influence beyond capital Sanaa, which they took control of in September."

336|Palestinian statehood resolution defeated in UN Security Council vote|"World Palestinian statehood resolution defeated in UN Security Council vote

InterAksyon.com

The online news portal of TV5

NEW YORK - The United Nations Security Council failed Tuesday to adopt a resolution on Palestinian statehood that was strongly opposed by the United States.

China, France, and Russia were among the eight countries that voted in favor of the text, but the resolution fell short of winning the nine ""yes"" votes necessary for adoption in the 15-member council.

Australia and the United States voted against, and five other countries abstained, including Britain.

The resolution drafted by the Palestinians and backed by Arab countries would have paved the way to a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

It set a 12-month deadline for Israel to reach a final peace deal with the Palestinians and called for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories by the end of 2017.

Security Council member Jordan had requested the vote on the measure despite opposition from the United States, which argued that the resolution did not address Israel's security concerns.

""This resolution sets the stage for more division, not for compromise,"" said US Ambassador Samantha Power.

""This text addresses the concerns of just one side.""

US Secretary of State John Kerry had lobbied in the days leading up to the vote, calling 13 foreign ministers to explain US opposition.

Washington was not, however, compelled to resort to its veto power to block the measure -- a move that could have undermined US standing in the Arab world.

A US veto risked angering key Arab allies, including partners in the US-led coalition carrying out air strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.

Argentina, Chad, Chile, Jordan, and Luxembourg joined France, China, and Russia in supporting the resolution.

Lithuania, Nigeria, South Korea, and Rwanda abstained, along with Britain.

France votes 'yes'

France backed the resolution because of an ""urgent need to act,"" Ambassador Francois Delattre told the council. He expressed disappointment that efforts to negotiate a text that could win consensus failed.

""Our efforts must not stop here. It is our responsibility to try again. Before it's too late.""

International alarm is growing over the ongoing violence and the failure to restart negotiations that last broke down in April, when US Secretary of State John Kerry led a push for peace.

On Tuesday, a Palestinian teenager was seriously wounded by Israeli gunfire in the West Bank, according to family members. The army said he had thrown a suspected explosive device at troops.

The vote caps a three-month campaign by the Palestinians at the United Nations to win support for a resolution that sets a timeframe for ending the Israeli occupation.

The Palestinians presented changes to the text on Monday, toughening up language on East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state and demanding an end to Jewish settlement building.

Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour earlier called on the Security Council to adopt the resolution to show that it was in sync with international momentum to recognize Palestine and advance peace in the Middle East.

Mansour took an indirect swipe at the United States, saying Arab and European governments had sought compromise to ""open a door for peace at the Security Council,"" but that ""one party did not want to go along with this global consensus.""

Washington has in the past repeatedly vetoed UN resolutions seen as undermining its ally Israel.

The Palestinians have warned that if the resolution is rejected, they will join the International Criminal Court to launch legal action against Israel and push for greater recognition through the UN General Assembly."

Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model-turned-actress Molly Sims, 41, is pregnant with her second child with husband, film producer Scott Stuber. She posted a photo of her growing family vacationing in the Bahamas, on Instagram.

When Sims was pregnant in 2012 with her son Brooks, she gained 72 pounds. She had a difficult time losing the weight even with a rigorous exercise regimen. It turned out Sims had postpartum thyroiditis, an inflammation of the thyroid gland. She took medication and felt much better. The Mayo Clinic reports: it's believed that women who develop postpartum thyroiditis likely have an underlying autoimmune thyroid condition that flares after childbirth due to fluctuations in immune function. Sims may be in for another big gain.

343|No happy ending to 2014 for Greece|"The Greek ADRs trading on the US Exchanges suffered a significant loss on Monday after a parliamentary vote to elect a president in Greece and avoid “snap” national elections failed in its third and final attempt. The news brings no surprise but raised concerns about a new period of political turmoil just as it emerges from economic crisis.

In Greece’s vote Monday, just 168 lawmakers out of 300 voted in favor of the government’s candidate for the largely ceremonial role of president, former European Commissioner Stavros Dimas, 12 votes shy of the 180 needed to avoid a dissolution of Parliament.

“Today we held the final vote for the president of the republic. We did whatever we could to elect a president and avoid elections,” Prime Minister Samaras said in a televised address following the vote. “That which Parliament didn’t do is now the hour of the Greek people to do: to eliminate the uncertainty and restore stability to the country.”

“The outcome of the final vote extends the political uncertainty for at least one month,” said Theodore Krintas, head of wealth management at Attica Bank in Athens. “One cannot know if the result of early elections will be a viable government.”

Shares of Greek bank National Bank of Greece was getting hit hardest by the Greek sell-off, followed by shipping stocks like FreeSeas and DryShips Inc.

Now Greece is likely to hold national elections on the last Sunday in January, possibly paving the way for Syriza party, a left-wing coalition that leads most polls over the ruling New Democracy party and has a very strong disagreement with the national debt. This is a party that wants to renegotiate the austerity terms of a 240-billion euro EU-IMF bailout program that Greece still needs to keep paying its bills.

“With the will of our people, in a few days bailouts tied to austerity will be a thing of the past,” Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras said after the vote. “The future has already begun.”

Negotiations between Greece and its international creditors from the so-called creditor troika — the EU, IMF and European Central Bank — had been due in January to bring the 240 billion euro ($290 billion) rescue package to an end and agree an interim, post-bailout program.

A Syriza win could also encourage populist parties in other parts of the world seeking to challenge a European plan to fix its debt crisis that has largely calmed turbulence in financial markets but failed to deliver better living standards for the nation struggling with high unemployment.

Janet Henry, HSBC’s Chief European Economist, said “… some form of Syriza-led government currently looks the most likely. The Syriza leader, Alexis Tsipras, has consistently reaffirmed his commitment to keep Greece in the euro but still intends to renegotiate the national debt and also plans a U-turn on austerity and structural reform. This nevitably means that negotiations with the Troika will be difficult and any clashes and delays in the negotiation of Greece’s much-needed financing programme could well lead to renewed market concerns about Greece’s continued euro membership.”

But, Teneo Intelligence analyst Wolfango believes Piccoli Syriza will not be able to control the government.

The analyst said “While the main opposition Syriza is the frontrunner party in what is likely to be a bitterly fought electoral race, its lead over Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’ New Democracy Party has decreased over the past few weeks to a thin margin of around 3-4 percentage points. The narrowing of the gap between the two parties can be largely attributed to the government and local media stressing the threat that Syriza can pose to Greece’s economy and political stability. The “fear factor” will continue to be the main card used by PM Samaras and his party during the election campaign. As for the likely outcome of early parliamentary elections, Syriza is expected to win them. However, it will probably do so with a small margin and not enough parliamentary seats to form a government on its own, given that it would need to secure at least 36-38% of the votes to control an outright majority in parliament.”

The Greek political instability could also cause difficulties for the European Central Bank, which was taking into account buying government bonds to spur a sluggish economy. The most credible part of such a quantitative-easing plan includes the central bank’s purchasing bonds of all the countries that utilize the euro as their official currency, which could lock the ECB into the awkward position of buying tumbling Greek debt."
344|Massachusetts hospitals grapple with $34M in Medicaid cuts|"Massachusetts hospitals grapple with $34M in Medicaid cuts

Boston Business Journal Wednesday 31st December, 2014

The exterior of Boston Medical Center.

With the stroke of Gov. Deval Patrick's pen, Boston Medical Center lost $4 million.

The hospital was one of 34 hospitals in the state to be affected by a $34 million cut to Medicaid funding, part of $329 million in midyear budget cuts the governor made to numerous state budget lines.

For hospitals catering to large Medicaid populations, also called disproportionate share hospital, the cut will reduce the amount each institution receives in Medicaid reimbursements, lowering their bottom lines.

""DSH hospitals have been going through a financially stressful time to begin with,"" said Tim Gens, executive vice president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association. ""For the most part, they have a smaller portion of private sector payments, and most of the population they care for are reliant on government programs.""

A spokesman for State Rep. Robert DeLeo said the House Committee on Ways & Means is studying the cuts and will begin conversations with the new administration in January about potentially restoring funding.

Disproportionate-share hospitals have traditionally benefited from higher Medicaid rates than their counterparts, collecting supplemental payments to bring reimbursements closer to the cost of that service, and making up for the fact that a larger portion of their patients use the low reimbursing programs. ...

345|Walmart shooting: Two-year-old accidentally kills mother in Idaho|"In an unfortunate event, a 29-year-old woman was accidentally shot dead by her toddler son at a northern Idaho Walmart on Tuesday.

According to the authorities, a 2-year-old boy fatally shot at his mother after he accidentally found a concealed gun into her purse while the woman along with her other three children went for a shopping at a Walmart store in Hayden, Idaho, which is northeast of Spokane in Washington.

Stu Miller, spokesperson of Kootenai County sheriff, said that the woman had a permit of concealed weapons.

Miller said that the woman, whose identity was not released, and her family had come to the area to visit their relatives.

The authorities said that the toddler, who was left in a shopping cart, reached into the purse of the victim and got a small-caliber handgun, the weapon that took life of his mother.

The woman’s husband was not present at the store when the unfortunate incident took place at around 10:20 am local time.

Meanwhile, the Walmart store remained close on Tuesday and was expected to not re-open until Wednesday morning.

“The shooting was a very sad and tragic accident. We are working closely with the local sheriff’s department while they investigate what happened,” said Brooke Buchanan, a Walmart spokesperson, in a statement.

This is not the first incident when accidental fatalities involving children handling guns has occurred in the United States.

In November, a 3-year-old boy got seriously injured in Washington state when he was accidentally shot by his 4-year-old neighbor. Again in April this year, a 2-year-old boy apparently shot dead his 11-year-old sister while they were playing with a gun at their Philadelphia home."

""The public is tired of survival politics, and repelled by ego-motivated politicians. That is the real governmental corruption. Israel has been paralyzed for six years under a prime minister who lacks horizons and vision,"" Herzog said.

He added, ""Trajtenberg is the embodiment of Zionism. He immigrated to Israel as a boy, and carved out a place for himself in the Israeli economy with his own two hands. He got a PhD from Harvard, but he is a practical man. He was the first chairman of the National Economic Council in the Prime Minister's Office. Together, we presented a goal of reducing poverty and bolstering employment. We presented a revolution for Holocaust survivors following the 2007 crisis after years of neglect."" RELATED ARTICLES Trajtenberg C'ttee whitewashed gov't actions Trajtenberg: Gov't failed on housing

Livni said, ""When I heard the cry on Rothschild Blvd three and a half years ago, I saw how the few became many. It opened people's hearts and mine, too. It changed priorities, and it should have. It had to happen, and it will happen after we replace the government. That's the reason why we're here - to say that people are becoming the focus. We're looking people in the eye and telling them, 'Your cry was not in vain.'""

Trajtenberg, who left the Council for Higher Education for politics several weeks ago, said that he had never conducted political negotiations with any group other than Herzog and Livni.

""I'm not responsible for media rumors,"" Trajtenberg declared. Referring to the committee he headed, he said that because he was not a cabinet member, he was unable to influence implementation of the recommendations. ""I decided to join in order to carry out what the government didn't at the time, when it had the recommendations at hand. I'm repaying a debt.""

He added, ""We're all looking for a new way that will lead to a more just society, with real equality of opportunity, and will encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. When I headed the committee that was appointed following the social protest, I answered someone who asked, 'Why should we believe you?' that my job was to translate the longing of minds for change into professional language. I made it clear then that if the government didn't implement the recommendations, I would dedicate myself personally to completing the task, and that's what I'm doing now by joining Herzog and Livni and many others around them. The task is doable; it's in our hands. It's time to unite, not to divide - to create a large middle-of-the-road political force with a clear ideological platform that will be able to translate a vision into deeds - the combination of Herzog and Livni is doing just that, and I'm proud to join them.""

347|Cold-wave effect decreasing in Tarai, says MFD|"Details Published on Wednesday, 31 December 2014 09:43 Nepalnews Hits: 1039

Privacy Policy

The effect of cold-wave and fog in various parts of Tarai that had badly affected lives in the region in past few weeks is gradually decreasing now.

According to Meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecast Division (MFD), Min Kumar Aryal, the effect of cold-wave has weakened since Tuesday and the division forecasts that the weather will remain normal until Thursday.

Aryal says although there is an improvement in the weather, it does not mean that the cold-wave effect has completely ended in the region.

The mid and western regions still have partly cloudy skies and because the cold-effect is still increasing in regions of Pakistan and India, it cannot be said that temperature is increasing in Nepal, says Aryal.

Aryal adds the cold weather will be active till mid-January.

According to Rautahat District Police, the cold weather has claimed lives of four people so far in the district. Janak Hajari Paswan, Rima Kumari Yadav, Sukhal Mahato and Rajdev Pandit have lost their lives to cold in Rautahat.

Local administrations say the number of patients affected by cold has also increased in other districts.

Meteorologist Aryal has urged the media to verify the reasons behind the death of people in Tarai before publishing the same. He says that some deaths may also have occurred due to other health conditions as well.

Spokesperson for Ministry of Home Affairs Laxmi Prasad Dhakal says local administrations in cold-affected areas have been kept on alert to minimise the damages that can be affected by the bad weather.

Warm clothes and other utilities for protection against cold have also been distributed in various areas, adds Dhakal."
348|Cases of historic plan crash survivors|"CCTV.com

12-31-2014 12:48 BJT

Although the probability of surviving a plane crash is very low, there are documented cases of survivors.?

On November 23, 1996, the Ethiopian airlines flight 961 Boeing 767 was hijacked by three Ethiopians while en route to Kenya from Ethiopia. The hijackers threatened to blow up the aircraft and demanded the pilot change course toward Australia. The captain attempted to negotiate with the hijackers, but his efforts were in vain. The plane’s fuel ran out, causing both engines to stall.

""I was sure I was not going to make it to the airport, so my last option was just to go over the beach, where rescue was available,"" said the flight’s captain.

Finally, the plane made a forced landing into the Indian Ocean near the coast of Grande Comore. The left wing and engine crashed into the water, triggering disintegration of the fuselage. Tourists from the island witnessed the crash, and rescue operations began immediately. Among the 175 passengers and crew on board, 50 people survived.

On June 3, 2009, a Yemeni fight crashed into the Indian Ocean because of weather complications during landing. The plane’s wreckage was found on the day of the crash. Of the 153 people on board, only a 14-year-old French girl survived. She was rescued by local fisherman, having survived in the water for more than 13 hours by clinging to a piece of the wreckage.

Pussy Riot member Maria Alekhina said on Twitter that she and other protesters who stayed the night near the famous Moscow landmark were detained by police early Wednesday.

Activists at the OVD Info group said 18 people were taken to a nearby police station.

A few thousand people rallied outside the Red Square on Tuesday in the boldest anti-government demonstration in years to protest against the court conviction of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and his brother. Police allowed the protesters to stay for about two hours before dispersing the crowd.

OVD Info said over 200 people were also arrested on Tuesday although many have been released.

351|Mexican Zapatista Rebel Movement Marks its 21st Anniversary|"After two decades of civil struggle, the claims of the Zapatistas remain alive in Mexico.

On January 1, 1994, Mexico was supposed to enter the First World with great honors and celebrations: that day, the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. and Canada, signed by then President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, began to take effect.

That New Year's eve, politicians and entrepreneurs celebrated the last step to draw Mexico into the globalized neoliberal system. Little did they know that a few thousand organized indigenous people would expose the lies and injustice of that system and would amaze the world with their claims of autonomy and dignity.

That morning, 21 years ago, a rebel army known later as Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional (Zapatista Army of National Liberation, EZLN) came down from a mountain and unexpectedly took seven city halls in the southern state of Chiapas, which was, and still is, the poorest state in the country.

21 years ago today, the EZLN was preparing for an armed uprising. Today they stand with 43 students from #Ayotzinapa pic.twitter.com/w1ZNtAsPIN — Hilary Klein (@HilaryGKlein) December 31, 2014

The army was composed of indigenous men and women from different Mayan communities, whom were masked with balaclavas and who had precarious rifles and guns, some of them made of wood.

In a press release, EZLN said that they were the result of 500 years of fight for true independence in Mexico: first from Spaniards, then from the U.S., Frenchmen, and all the other powers that tried to bend Mexican population.

“But today we say ENOUGH!, we are the heirs of the true builders of our nation, we are millions of poor people and we ask our brothers to join in this call as the only way not to die of starvation before the insatiable ambition of a dictatorship of more than 70 years, lead by some traitors that represent the most conservative groups of the country.” said the EZLN General Command that day.

The uprising of the Zapatistas was a shout loud and clear in the face of Salinas' administration: “We are still here”. Zapatistas declared war to the government and the Mexican army, and demanded respect, autonomy, independence, dignity, and equality for the people that have been forgotten trough most of Mexican history: the indigenous and the poor.

EZLN claimed that with the new free trade agreement the globalized and ambitious economic system would finish the constant plunder of the lands and rights that the indigenous people had suffered for years, benefitting, as usual, the richest and most powerful classes.

Dozens of journalists from all over the world traveled to Chiapas, an unknown and irrelevant part of the world for many of them, to cover the news, the surreal uplifting of those masked poor people that had orders to advance all their way to the capital and defeat the Mexican army, and whose leader was a charismatic mestizo who smoked pipe and was only known as Vice Commander Marcos.

However, for the population in general, the Zapatista guerrilla movement was the fight for all the promises of freedom and lands that were forgotten after the Mexican Revolution. That is the reason they took the name of one of the revolution’s most authentic leaders: Emiliano Zapata.

After the uprising, the Mexican government sent the army and negotiators to Chiapas, and after some tense years, in 1996 both parts signed the San Andres Agreements. These are a series of accords to ensure the equality and the rights of indigenous people in Mexico.

However, it was not long before the authorities ignored the agreements and even violated them.

Since then, EZLN has been adopting and creating diverse methods of struggle and resistance. It is not surprising the Zapatistas have once again invited the parents of Ayotzinapa missing students as honor guests of their resistance festival: both fights were born from the deep social injustice that greedy companies and corrupt politicians have created in Mexico for many years.

The rebel movement has also protested in solidarity with the families of the Ayotzinapa students.

The following tweet mentions that the Ayotzinapa missing students’ families will be celebrating the EZLN’s 21st anniversary in Chiapas. And in the photograph, an EZLN protest sign reads, “your outrage is ours too”, in reference to their solidarity with the case of the missing teacher trainees.

Both fights came from the poorest states of the country: Guerrero and Chiapas. And both movements have the same basic demands, which are recognition and social justice.

Twenty-one years after the Zapatista uprising things have not changed a lot: Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto (who belongs to the same political party that Salinas) did a lot of reforms to privatize the country's energy resources, and sell them to the best foreign bidder, in order to “make Mexico move.”

Once again, violence and poverty in the state originated a big social movement and international pressure.

However, the Zapatistas were the first ones to defy the Mexican authorities and demand dignity and independence for those who have less in the country."

The end of 2014 did not prove to be good for Pakistan. The enemies of the state saddened the arrival of a new year by killing over hundred children in Peshawar.

While New Year will be observed in Pakistan with simplicity, authorities have also made strict security arrangements all over the country due to persisting security threats.

Section-144 is imposed in Islamabad on the eve, while police are also directed to collar the ones riding motorcycle without silencer.

In Karachi, a ban is in place on New Year night ceremonies, while the ones involved in celebratory gunfire will be sent away to jails. Pillion riding in the largest metropolis has already been banned for a day.

Meanwhile, all the roads leading to seaside have been blocked by placing containers and barricades.

For maintaining order on New Year eve, seven thousand police personnel have also been deployed in the city.

Local authorities have also imposed section-144 in Multan due to looming security threats."

354|Steve Scalise Courted White Supremacists, But Doesn’t Today’s GOP?|"More often than not in America, it’s perfectly fine to be in support of or facilitator for policies that perpetuate White supremacy so long as you aren’t directly linked to direct expressions of racism.

That, more than anything, is the root of Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise’s (pictured center) current troubles in the fallout of it being revealed that he delivered a speech to White supremacist group European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO) in 2002. Scalise is the the No. 3-ranking House Republican in a Congress that has consistently obstructed our country’s first Black President.

Scalise is a powerful man in a political party that actively works to suppress minority voters; has drawn congressional maps that have limited the power of the Black vote in districts across the country; has not only served as a safe house for Whites clinging to their racism as if life itself has no meaning without it, but has actively flirted with this fringe in the name of maintaining power; and is aggressively doing his part to curtail immigration reform, which is a direct assault on the nation’s soon-to-be largest minority group: Latinos.

It’s not all that different from former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Several years ago, ESPN personality and writer Bomani Jones penned a piece entitled “Sterling’s Racism Should Be News.” Sterling was sued by the Department of Justice on Monday for housing discrimination. Still, it took a TMZ audio clip of Sterling making blatantly racist comments to see him painted what he’s long been: a racist.

Here we are again, and now Steve Scalise is the target.

Already, the usual reactions have poured in. House Speaker John Boehner has released a statement, defending him and speaking to his “character”:

“More than a decade ago, Representative Scalise made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate. Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I know Steve to be a man of high integrity and good character. He has my full confidence as our Whip, and he will continue to do great and important work for all Americans.”

And there’s been a Black Democrat to lend his credibility to preserve Scalise’s character: Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), told the New Orleans Times-Picayune, “I don’t think Steve Scalise has a racist bone in his body.” Another minority, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal also backed Scalise, but given “Bobby” Jindal’s past opinions on race, he wouldn’t acknowledge racism if it called itself a Grand Wizard and hollered epithets directly in his face. He’s much like Whoopi Goldberg, in that way.

Of course, Scalise has been very apologetic about the speech in question, condemning the “hate group,” conveniently noting how their views conflict with his Catholicism, while also feigning ignorance about what the group truly represented at the time. Meanwhile, the Internet quickly uncovered the EURO’s website as it appeared in 2002.

Unless Scalise was temporarily blind and without staff at the time, there was no way he could’ve truly not known the kind of crowd he was courting.

No matter.

Scalise will likely be forced to resign in due time. And if former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke has his way, so may others considering he’s now threatening to out other political leaders who have spoken before other pro-White flocks.

So be it, but that only begins to crack the surface of the problem.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spokesman’s Drew Hammill called Scalise’s admission “deeply troubling for a top Republican leader in the House.”

Hammill went on to add:

“However, actions speak louder than whatever Steve Scalise said to that group in 2002. Just this year, House Republicans have refused to restore the Voting Rights Act or pass comprehensive immigration reform and leading Republican members are now actively supporting in the federal courts efforts by another known extremist group, the American Center for Law and Justice, which is seeking to overturn the President’s immigration executive actions. Speaker Boehner’s silence on this matter is yet another example of his consistent failure to stand up to the most-extreme elements of his party.”

Not to mention, Scalise’s record in Louisiana includes him voting twice against establishing Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday as a holiday. Yet, this man is the third-highest ranking Republican in the GOP-controlled Congress.

Scalise has benefitted from courting racists, but the same goes for the party that has empowered him. When will everyone grow upset about that?

355|Comet Lovejoy Will Be Visible to Naked Eye|"(Newser) – Comets are basically like cats, a senior researcher at Johns Hopkins University tells the Christian Science Monitor: ""They're very interesting, and they do what they want."" That may explain that even though scientists didn't think Comet C/2014 Q2 (also known as Comet Lovejoy) would prove to be visible to the human eye when it was discovered back in August, it now will be to viewers in non-light-polluted areas, thanks to the unpredictability of comet brightness. Peak viewing times will be in mid-January, the Monitor notes, with the comet appearing to the right of the bottom half of Orion's bow on Jan. 7—the day the comet will come closest to Earth at 44 million miles. There won't be an encore performance in our lifetime, either: The comet isn't scheduled to loop around this way for another 8,000 years.

The comet was discovered over the summer by Australian astronomer Terry Lovejoy, who employed nothing more than a simple backyard telescope with an 8-inch mirror, National Geographic reports. The comet, a ""long-period"" object believed to be on an extended journey through the skies, likely originated from the Oort cloud, a mass of orbiting ice and dust artifacts from the beginning of the solar system. Scientists weren't expecting a strong light show, but comets are notoriously touch and go, with a variety of factors affecting their ultimate brightness, including how much ice they hold, their temperature, and how close they streak past the Earth. Because the comet will be ascending higher into the sky each night, skywatchers should be able to see it through the end of January, depending on location. (Last year, the Hubble Space Telescope spotted a comet-like object with six tails.)

356|The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram|"The pooches at the Aloft Asheville Downtown hotel are part of an adoption program run by the hotel and Charlie's Angels Animal Rescue.

LOS ANGELES — At this hotel, guests get welcomed with a wagging tail or a warm lick to the face.

A dog will bound out from behind the registration desk, clad in an “Adopt Me” vest, as visitors arrive at the Aloft hotel in downtown Asheville, North Carolina, believed to be the only hotel in the U.S. where guests can adopt the dog that greets them when they check in.

Additional Photos n this Nov. 23, 2014 photo provided by Jan Trantham, Will Trantham kneels by Jackson, left, a Shih Tzu, along with Darcy, center, and Sophie. The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store →

But the hotel doesn’t overwhelm road-weary travelers to this mountain tourist mecca, where people come to tour the nation’s largest home, the Biltmore estate; cast a fly-fishing rod; or hoist a beer in what has been dubbed “Beer City USA.” There’s only one adoptable dog at a time, and it’s always on a leash.

The pooches at the Aloft Asheville Downtown hotel are part of an adoption program run by the hotel and Charlie’s Angels Animal Rescue. The rescue saves the pets from possible euthanasia at area shelters.

“We feel like we are saving lives,” said Christine Kavanagh, Aloft’s director of sales.

Hotel and rescue workers hope the program not only becomes permanent but spreads to some of the chain’s other locations, too. The Asheville hotel, which also allows guests’ pets to stay for free, opened in 2012 and has not received one complaint about allergies, messes or dueling dogs, Kavanagh said.

The adoptable dogs have space set aside at the registration desk, on the roof, third floor and in certain employee areas. They can’t stay in guest rooms at night but can go with visitors to the restaurant, bar and other spots if they’re on a leash.

“The guests love it. It shows up on guest reviews and consumer surveys,” Kavanagh said.

Caren Ferris of Amherst, Massachusetts, and her husband certainly did. The couple were staying nearby when they met a 4-year-old terrier mix named Ginger in the hotel bar and cozied up to the pooch sporting an “Adopt Me” vest.

After a visit, “I got up to leave and told her goodbye. She sat up, looked me in the eye and kissed me on the lips. So I called the shelter, thinking maybe we should adopt the dog,” Ferris said.

She and her husband filled out the adoption papers, paid $175 in fees and waited to be approved before they were able to take Ginger home to meet their other dogs.

Charlie’s Angels has tough adoption standards, including a home visit. If a potential owner is from another state, the rescue will ask a shelter there to do the check.

The restrictions haven’t stopped 14 dogs from finding homes since the program started in July, said Kim Smith, president of Charlie’s Angels. The rescue’s placements have doubled since the hotel started stationing the dogs.

Jan Trantham and her husband, from Atlanta, adopted a 2-year-old Shih Tzu named Jackson. They fell in love with him when they checked in, she said.

“Every time we went somewhere, one of us would say, ‘Let’s go back to the hotel and see Jackson.’ l couldn’t stop thinking about this dog,” Trantham said.

It’s also a wonderful way for the dogs — and the guests — to socialize, Kavanagh said.

“We have a little playpen by the front desk. At times, there’s a crowd around the pen because the dog is a conversation starter,” Kavanagh said. “Our hotel draws people together so they can mix and mingle and maybe adopt a dog.”"
357|Burger & Lobster restaurant shames customers on Facebook who 'forgot' to pay for meal|"Burger & Lobster’s new Cardiff restaurant has caused a storm after posting a picture of a family who allegedly left without paying online.

In a post on the restaurant’s Facebook page, the company alleged a group of four people had left without paying.

“To this family that walked out tonight without paying their bill, we are sure this was just a ‘mistake’ and you completely forgot, so out of the goodness of your heart please call the restaurant tomorrow to pay the bill. Thanks.”

The restaurant later deleted the photo but not before more than 600 people had commented on it.

The tone of the post was not well received by many of the restaurant's more than 2,700 fans.

Francesca Coles wrote: “People make mistakes like this all the time, especially if there is a few of them.

""I’ve had to go back and pay after leaving and realising. Not a very professional approach by this food chain if these customers have left in error!

“I don’t like the way in which you operate and puts me off ever coming into your establishment! Disgusting!”

Poll loading …

Oliver Price agreed: “Genuinely a disgrace posting this on a social media platform.

“If this is a mistake and they come back and pay how are you going to ‘re inform’ everyone who saw this that they made a genuine error. Terrific social faux par here.”

And Mink Kleekai added: “Disgraceful action by the restaurant, they have given this family little time to make amends before trying to publicly shame them on social media.

“Totally unprofessional management of this situation, which makes you wonder if the front and back of house are also mismanaged.”

However, a number of posters said the restaurant was right to shame the group.

Situated on Cardiff’s The Hayes in the old Habitat building, the 300-seater restaurant has only three items on the menu - the option of a burger, lobster or a lobster roll with fries and salad, with everything priced £20.

Burger & Lobster has been approached for comment."

Lack of daily physical activity linked to vascular dysfunction

Posted on by RoosterRedux

University of Missouri School of Medicine researchers have found that reducing daily physical activity for even a few days leads to decreases in the function of the inner lining of blood vessels in the legs of young, healthy subjects, causing vascular dysfunction that can have prolonged effects.

Paul Fadel, associate professor of medical pharmacology and physiology, and John Thyfault, associate professor of nutrition and exercise physiology, also found that the vascular dysfunction induced by five days of inactivity requires more than one day of returning to physical activity and taking at least 10,000 steps a day to improve.

We know the negative consequences from not engaging in physical activity can be reversed, said Fadel. There is much data to indicate that at any stage of a disease, and at any time in your life, you can get active and prolong your life.

Diabetes and cardiovascular disease risks

Inactivity is typically going to lead to people being overweight and obese, said Fadel. The next step after that is insulin resistance, which leads to Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 29 million Americans are living with diabetes. That number is expected to continue to increase: the CDC estimates one-third of people born after 2000 will have Type 2 diabetes in their lifetimes.

I suffer from peripheral neuropathy. Initially it felt like I had socks on my feet but I didn’t. Then the numbness worked its way up my legs. Walking became difficult. I found if I power walked for about half an hour a day my legs felt better, Now I power walk about an hour a day and even though some days I really don’t feel like doing it I force myself to walk because my overall well being has improved so much because of it. Today it was 32 degrees with a wind chill down to 18. Bundled up like the Michelin tire and only walked for about 35 minute but at least I got out there.

I walk an hour a day now with two artificial knees. It has slowed me down some as I age. But when I was younger, I ran 6-8 miles a day for over forty years training to run road races. Raced 10k's, half-marathons and marathons Running at 8 minutes a mile, it takes just short of an hour to run 6 miles and just over an hour to run 8 miles. You must take long lunches and breaks if you cover those same distances walking. But you are correct, running or walking daily is good for anybody who can physically do it.

I simply wore my knee cartilage out completely. Bone-on-bone. But my knee doctor said my running didn't play a significant role in my knee problems. Said it was all genetic. My dad wore his knee cartilage out at the exact same age I did (62) and he never ran a day in his life, nor was he an athlete like I was. It was just in the familial genes, the doc said. Many conditions are linked to your parents and family history. Little can be done to avoid these issues as you get older, no matter what you do to forestall or avoid them during your youth. I exercised regularly, ran daily, practiced yoga, never smoked, didn't drink alcohol but still developed heart problems at age 63. I had to have open heart surgery to by-pass four occluded coronary arteries. My cardiologist, again, said it was in the genes. Both my parents had heart issues and so do my siblings. You can't go back and change who you were born to. I told the doctor, that if I had known that was the case, I would have drank, smoked and partied in my youth instead of following a strict, healthier routine. He said that would just have speeded up the process and my heart issues would have surfaced at a younger age. My wife is slight, weighing only 103 lbs. She eats moderately and nutritionally. But she has to take medication for high cholesterol. Why? Genetics. High cholesterol runs in her entire family.

One has to have the time during the day to take these extended walks just to say hello. Most people don't that excess time because of work, commuting and family burdens. But I am retired, kids are grown and there is not commute to contend with. So I get out to walk for an hour every day, taking my dog with me. Since I live in the country on a beef cattle farm, my wife and I have daily chores and projects that require physical effort to perform, so that keeps us moving and exercises our bodies. But I still don't have the two hours available to walk five mile to and from the house just to hello to someone. That's what I have a smart phone for. :-)

Tell your wife to read the study on Turmeric, and how it helps lower the bad cholesterol. Don’t use curry spice mix, but the actual ground turmeric. Only use the yellow, the red is one India uses for religious purposes and does not contain enough of active ingredient. The study suggests about 1/2 - 1 tsp daily (1.5 g.), it can be put in food....use with pepper, as it multiplies the benefit magnificently. Some people take it with coconut oil as a supplement, others put it in scrambled eggs cooked in coconut oil as a fat creates potency. The study has shown benefits to diabetics as well. One must check w doctor and/or monitor medicines carefully, to make sure blood sugar is maintained properly. It will cleanse the liver while helping with bad cholesterol. Several other benefits listed in study. The active ingredient is curcumin, and use an organic turmeric, not expensive as some spices go. The Epicurean Digest has an article ‘Trumeric Dosage and Method’.

Tuesday was Shreveport Mayor Ollie Tyler's second day in office and she spent part of the day holding a press conference. Tyler talked about what's next which includes putting together a new team.

""We have not had any resignations yet, but we have had people who have expressed they are going to resign"" says Tyler.

362|Bad weather halts recovery of bodies from AirAsia flight|"Stormy weather forced Indonesian rescuers Wednesday to suspend their search for the bodies of 162 people aboard an ill-fated AirAsia plane, as investigators started trying to piece together why the flight plunged into the sea.

After two days of scouring the Java Sea for signs of the missing aircraft, search teams on Tuesday began recovering debris and bodies, sending relatives waiting anxiously for news into distraught outpourings of emotion.

Although officials promised another massive search on Wednesday, storms forced them to halt the hunt for the remaining bodies and the rest of the plane, which had been travelling from Indonesia's second biggest city Surabaya to Singapore when it crashed.

""We are experiencing bad weather now. Rains and winds prevented us from resuming the search operation this morning,"" air force rescue coordinator S.B. Supriyadi told AFP.

National Search and Rescue Agency chief Bambang Soelistyo told a press conference Wednesday that six bodies had now been recovered, including a woman in crew uniform.

""As soon as the weather is clear, the bodies will be brought to Pangkalan Bun,"" the town with the nearest airstrip to the crash site, said Soelistyo.

Supriyadi said that hundreds of people from the military, police and national rescue agency were on standby waiting for clear weather in Pangkalan Bun.

The plane crashed into the Java Sea southwest of the island of Borneo, with debris including an exit door and a blue suitcase so far retrieved from the area.

During Tuesday's searches, an air force plane saw a ""shadow"" on the seabed believed to be that of the missing flight, where all search efforts were now being concentrated, Soelistyo said.

Investigators were also looking into the cause of the crash, which is the third disaster for a Malaysian carrier this year.

Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch said Tuesday that one of its investigators had arrived in Singapore and met with experts there who are assisting the Indonesian investigation.

- Hunt for black boxes -

Soelistyo said the hunt was on for the plane's crucial black boxes, which would be handled by the national transport safety committee.

""We have concerns to secure the flight recorders, believed to be with parts of plane we haven't found,"" he said.

Before take-off the pilot had asked for permission to fly at a higher altitude to avoid the storm but his request was not approved due to heavy use on the popular route, according to AirNav, Indonesia's air traffic control.

In his last communication, the pilot said he wanted to change course to avoid the menacing storm system. Then all contact was lost, about 40 minutes after the plane had taken off.

""There were some very unique weather conditions and let's wait for the investigation to be concluded,"" flamboyant AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes told reporters on Tuesday in Surabaya, after meeting with relatives.

""This is a scar with me for the rest of my life,"" he said, describing the incident as an airline chief executive's ""worst nightmare"".

The missing plane was operated by AirAsia Indonesia, a unit of Malaysian-based AirAsia, which had previously earned a solid safety record.

Of the 162 passengers and crew on board Flight QZ8501, 155 were Indonesian.

President Joko Widodo also met the victims' families in Surabaya on Tuesday, where a crisis centre has been set up, and he promised to ensure a huge search.

Relatives began crying hysterically and fainting as Indonesian television footage showed a body floating in the sea during aerial searches.

""Before this everything was unclear. At least there is now some form of closure,"" said businessman Agus Panjaya, 36, who six relatives on the plane.

Early on Wednesday, relatives were gathering at the crisis centre again, where they were expected to give documents to help with identifying the bodies.

The Pentagon said Tuesday that the US Navy plans to send a second ship to help the search for the wreckage, which is already being assisted by Australia, Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia.

China, which had 152 citizens on board Malaysia Airlines MH370 -- the flight that vanished in March, offered to send a frigate and military aircraft to help with the international search.

The crash comes at the end of an awful year for Malaysian air travel.

After the disappearance of Flight MH370, en route from from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew, another Malaysia Airlines flight -- MH17 -- was shot down over Ukraine in July, killing all 298 on board.

The MSM will have a field day with Scalise and most likely will force him to resign his leadership roles. So called, conservative pundits Steve Hayes and Krauthammer were saying he should pack it in last night. The hypocritical media gives Obama a free ride with Sharpton, Rev. Wright,

Bill Ayers, Black Panthers etc. Time for pubbies to tell the MSM to go to hell as Reagan did and talk to the people directly.

I don’t care if Scalise is a RINO. Strip him of his leadership position and let his voters decide if they want to continue sending him to DC. Conservatives adopting this unethical and immoral democrat tactic to remove a RINO are going to burn us all. Now I see liberal relatives chattering with friends. about how they can go after Dave Brat over speaking to a group that supports animal fighting. The only thing we should be doing is telling the democrats to go **** themselves.

Agreed. I felt the same way with the Christie bridge situation. I don’t support that guy anymore but I’ll be damned if the left is going to take down guys in this party for no reason. I am a big believer in the slippery slope theory and allowing the left to take down people in our party just because we don’t like them politically will eventually lead to the loss of lots of good guys.

368|Police: Body Believed to Be Missing Toddler Found in Creek|"Police believe they have found the body of a 14-month-old Maryland boy who had been missing in central Ohio.

Cameron Beckford's mother previously told police she abandoned her son on a stranger's porch, but her attorney, Mark Collins, said his client made up the story.

On Wednesday, searchers found what they believe is Cameron's body in a creek on Columbus' far east side, police spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner confirmed.

Cameron's mother, Dainesha Stevens, appeared in court Wednesday on two felony charges related to the boy's disappearance and was ordered held on $150,000 bond.

Stevens, 24, is charged with endangering children and tampering with evidence. A charging document says Stevens failed to protect the boy by allowing someone to violently spank him several times.

According to The Columbus Dispatch, Stevens had taken Cameron and his 6-year-old sister to Columbus from Frederick, Maryland on Dec. 15.

Collins said that before leaving Maryland, Stevens called police for help, and received a bus pass from the local protective services agency.

Frederick, Maryland police spokesman Lt. Clark Pennington said a domestic dispute preceded Stevens' departure.

""I know that they had, like, an argument on the 14th and that's why we think she went to Ohio on the 15th,"" he said. Pennington said he didn't have immediate access to details about the dispute.

Frederick police previously said the father of the two children called police Sunday and reported that their mother had taken them to an unknown location in Columbus in mid-December. Based on the father's concerns, missing-child reports were issued.

369|Can Fingerprint Photos Fool Apple's Touch ID?|"Maybe Apple's Touch ID isn’t so secure after all. The Chaos Computer Club, a European hacker network that claims it first cracked the iPhone 5 fingerprint sensor over a year ago, is boasting about new methods to get access to a person's physical fingerprints using a regular camera. At a Chaos Communication Congress meeting on Saturday, Jan Krissler, a club hacker who goes by the handle “Starbug,” explained how he got fingerprints from people during public events with a camera -- then handily used them for biometric authentication . “In the past years, it was successfully demonstrated a number of times how easily fingerprints can be stolen from its [sic] owner if a person touched any object with a polished surface (like a glass or a smartphone),” according to a blog post about the event. “This time new, sometimes surprising ways to gather biometrical attributes will be introduced. With this knowledge there will be no need to steal objects carrying the fingerprints anymore.” Should Politicians Wear Gloves? At the meeting, the Chaos Computer Club demonstrated its claims using photos of German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen from a recent press conference with commercially available software called VeriFinger to create fingerprints that could fool biometric authentication. Although the hackers haven’t yet used this method to fool Apple’s Touch ID system, the Chaos Computer Club promised that the already questionable validity of vendor security claims about fingerprint systems will be even more disputed now. Starbug said, “After this talk, politicians will presumably wear gloves when talking in public.” iPhone 5s introduced Touch ID, a James Bond-like way to securely unlock the device with your finger -- or, more accurately, fingerprint. Touch ID is built into the smartphone's home button and uses a laser cut sapphire crystal, together with the capacitive touch sensor, to take a high-resolution image of your fingerprint. The technology analyzes the fingerprint and promises accurate readings from any angle. The Touch ID sensor recognizes the touch of a finger so the sensor is only activated when you mean to activate it. That preserves battery life. Addressing privacy concerns, Apple said fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely in the Secure Enclave inside the A7 chip on the iPhone 5s. The data is never stored on Apple servers or backed up to iCloud. Beyond unlocking the device, Touch ID can also be used as a secure way to approve purchases from the iTunes Store, App Store or iBooks Store. Is this secure enough to be the future of smartphone security? It Was a Matter of Time We caught up with Kevin O'Brien, vice president at computer software firm Conjur, to get his thoughts on Touch ID security. He told us when the phone launched he said that the fingerprint security on iOS was almost certainly going to be compromised. It turned out he was right. ""The two primary mechanisms of defense here are that the fingerprint data is being stored in hashed form, and that the data is being stored in a supposedly secure portion of the device,"" O'Brien said. ""Neither offers any real security."" First, he explained, hashed data can -- with dedicated access and time, and some insight -- typically be reversed. The ideal cryptographic hash would not be reversible. However, he said it is often possible to bypass a hash function either by comparing the output and input data and determining what was being done to the data to generate the hash, or by exploiting a weakness in the system to gain access to the data during hash generation. ""Secondly, the ‘isolated chip’ model of security is completely vulnerable to anyone with access to a phone. Assuming that someone was interested enough, it's possible to exploit any number of weaknesses on the device, and siphon off the fingerprint data while it is being written to, stored, or otherwise accessed,"" O'Brien said. ""We can safely assume that Apple has put some form of defense into this process, but once a device is physically compromised, security is essentially impossible."" Comment:

Name:

Wiliams: Posted: 2015-01-29 @ 8:21am PT I Bypass iCloud Activation on my iPhone with software from this webpage: www.bypassicloudlockios.com/ Hitoshi Anatomi: Posted: 2014-12-30 @ 11:36pm PT This may be just a minor problem of biometrics. There is a bigger loophole with biometrics, namely, a fallback/backup password.



The convenience of biometrics is often obtained by sacrificing the security. Bringing biometrics carelessly could end up with worsening the password headache instead of mitigating it.



Whether static, behavioral or electromagnetic, biometrics can theoretically be operated together with passwords in two ways, (1) by AND/conjunction or (2) by OR/disjunction. I would appreciate to hear if someone knows of a biometric product operated by (1). The users of such products must have been notified that, when falsely rejected by the biometric sensor with the devices finally locked, they would have to see the device reset. (It is the same with the biometrics operated without passwords altogether. Only in this case can it be claimed that biometrics are used as an alternative to the password.)



Biometric products like Apple's Touch ID are generally operated by (2) so that users can unlock the devices by passwords when falsely rejected by the biometric sensors. This means that the overall vulnerability of the product is the sum of the vulnerability of biometrics (x) and that of a password (y). The sum (x + y - xy) is necessarily larger than the vulnerability of a password (y), say, the devices with Touch ID and other biometric sensors are less secure than the devices protected only by a password. TheFingerprintGuy: Posted: 2014-12-30 @ 3:58pm PT Enrollment is considered a fundamentally secure operation by ALL methods, including password.



It's EXACTLY the same regardless of method. Biometrics has nothing to do with it.



You have no clue, Jay Meier. Neither does the author. Pure FUD. Mostly nonsense.



Oh, and the Chaos Club did NOT use these photos to bypass an IPhone TouchID - it used Verifinger SDK from Neurotechnologija.



All they did was take high resolution pictures of people's fingers and create enrollments with them, and then use the pictures as fingerprint samples.



They broke into their own lock - all they proved is that they could create a fingerprint image from...wait for it...an image of a finger.



Whoa ! It's like, you know, SCIENCE. Scary stuff, huh ?



It's a parlor trick, and nothing more.



They broke nothing, not even new ground. This is a known issue, and defeated by any liveness detection.



If I take a video of you entering your password, I will own you. If I take a video of you swiping your fingerprint, even if I can create a fingerprint image from that video, I still can't use that image to break into your phone - since modern sensors won't even image off paper.



You'd be back making molds or PCBs from that image and using that to make a fake finger...and that only works if you've got the device in hand and are willing to spend the $ to make those molds or PCBs.



This really changes nothing. It's all hoo-hah. Jay Meier: Posted: 2014-12-30 @ 6:38am PT This is a great article, expressing important points. There are two reasons to use biometrics...convenience (as with Apple) and security. There is a trade off between the two.



As important, there is little proof that you are who you claim to be when you enroll on the phone. I could associate my fingerprint with your identity on your phone and use your PayPal account.



Apple and Samsung and The FIDO Alliance may not care about security as much as transaction throughput...to create fees."

Ebola-ravaged Liberia on Wednesday lifted a night curfew in place since August to allow New Year's Eve services.

Justice Minister Benedict F. Sannoh said in a statement he was acting on the orders of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, herself a practising Christian.

""In an effort to enable churches and religious groups around the country to conduct traditional worship services on the eve of the New Year, I am pleased to announce... that curfew for Wednesday night... is hereby suspended.

""All churches and religious organisations conducting worship services on New Year Eve are advised to abide by all existing Ebola preventive protocols as well as the regulations issued by the minister of health,"" the statement said.

Christians comprise more than 85 percent of the population of Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, which was formed by freed American slaves.

Liberia imposed a night curfew and a state of emergency on August 6, following the Ebola outbreak. Curfew hours were initially from 9:00 pm to 6:00 am, but have now been reduced and start at midnight and last till 6:00 am.

But the state of emergency was lifted on November 11.

The death toll from the Ebola outbreak in west Africa has risen to 7,842 out of 20,081 cases recorded, according to the latest figures by the World Health Organization.

Liberia, long the hardest-hit country in the outbreak, has seen a clear decrease in transmission over the past month.

As of December 27, it counted 7,977 cases and 3,413 deaths, according to WHO statistics.

The man, identified only as Rahmat, had stopped his boat at Senggora Island, south of the town of Pangkalan Bun in Central Kalimantan, on Sunday as it had been raining continuously since dawn, Indonesian news portal Detik.com reported on Wednesday.

Air traffic controllers had lost contact with flight QZ8501 only shortly before that, during the plane's journey from Indonesia's second-largest city of Surabaya to Singapore.

""Around 7am, I heard a loud booming sound. Soon afterwards, there was haze that usually happened only during the dry season,"" Rahmat said at the Panglima Utar Port in Central Kalimantan on Wednesday.

He said it crossed his mind id there was a plane crash.

But two of his friends, also fishermen, dismissed the thought.

""Before the booming sound, my friends saw a plane from above Senggaro Island heading towards the sea. The plane was said to be flying relatively low but then disappeared,"" said the father of three.

As the rain eased, Rahmat went out to sea but could not catch any fish amid waves as high as two metres.

""The next day (Monday), I returned home. After watching news on the missing plane, I reported to the village head,"" said Rahmat, who lives in Kubu village in central Kalimantan.

373|Newlywed 95-year-old Virginia man dies weeks after wife taken from their home by police|"WASHINGTON - A 95-year-old newlywed Virginia man has died just weeks after his 96-year-old wife was taken away by family members to Florida.

Eddie Harrison died Tuesday in a hospital after suffering from influenza, said Rebecca Wright, who was caring for the couple in their Alexandria, Virginia, home. Harrison became distressed after his wife and longtime companion, 96-year-old Edith Hill, was taken away, Wright said. Wright is Hill's daughter.

""He lived for her, and she lived for him. It's the love story of the century,"" Wright said, recalling how they would dance, take walks and care for each other.

Harrison and Hill's marriage this year after 10 years of companionship was disputed in court. Their wedding was problematic because Hill has been declared legally incapacitated for several years. Another of Hill's daughters, Patricia Barber, contested the marriage, saying it would complicate the eventual distribution of Hill's estate. But Hill and Harrison said they wanted to stay together.

A judge appointed a new guardian for Hill to protect her interests, removing Barber and Wright as guardians, but left the marriage intact.

The interracial aspect of the marriage also was unique because the two longtime Virginians would not have been allowed to marry if they had met in their 20s, 30s or 40s under state law at the time.

On Dec. 6, Hill's guardian arrived to take Hill away to Barber's home in Florida for what was supposed to be a two-week vacation. Police were called to the home during a traumatic 40-minute negotiation to convince Hill to leave, Wright said.

When Hill did not return home as planned after two weeks, Harrison began to realize she was not coming back, Wright said. Daisy Birch, a family friend, said Harrison was heartbroken. He also became ill with the flu and checked himself into a hospital.

A dispute continues between the two sisters, Barber and Wright, over Hill's affairs and place of residence."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Average U.S. mortgage rates rose slightly this week, but the benchmark 30-year rate stayed near a 19-month low.

Mortgage giant Freddie Mac says the nationwide average for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage increased to 3.87 percent this week, up from 3.83 percent last week. The rate hit 3.80 percent earlier this month, lowest since May 2013.

The average for a 15-year mortgage also rose — to 3.15 percent this week from 3.10 a week earlier. The rate for a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage blipped up to 2.40 percent from 2.39 percent last week.

A year ago, the 30-year mortgage stood at 4.53 percent and the 15-year mortgage at 3.55 percent. Mortgage rates have remained low even though the Federal Reserve in October ended its monthly bond purchases, which were meant to keep long-term rates low.

To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country at the beginning of each week. The average doesn’t include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.

The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was 0.6 point, unchanged from last week. The fee for a 15-year mortgage was also unchanged at 0.6 point. The fee for a one-year ARM also was unchanged at 0.4 point.

The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage stayed at 3.01 percent; the fee was also unchanged at 0.5 point.

376|Suicide bomber at Yemen ceremony kills at least 24 - MyNorthwest|"SANAA, Yemen (AP) -- A suicide bomber attacked a ceremony Wednesday hosted by Shiite rebels commemorating the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, killing at least 24 people and wounding 48 in a country plagued by militants, authorities said.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on a cultural center in the city of Ibb, some 190 kilometers (120 miles) from the capital, Sanaa, though Yemen's local al-Qaida branch has carried out similar attacks in the past. Civilian officials, Shiite rebels, a famed poet and a leader of a political party all died in the attack, which left blood soaking the floor of an auditorium as men wailed to God.

Mohammed Abdel-Baki, the local spokesman for the Houthi rebels, said the governor of Ibb province had been at the event, but wasn't wounded. He described the attack as a ""massacre.""

""The torn body parts are everywhere. Pools of blood mixed with water. The scene is horrifying,"" he said. Abdel-Baki said the local hospital in Ibb had 24 corpses from the attack. Yemen's Interior Ministry put the toll at 23 people killed and 48 wounded.

Two other explosions rocked Ibb following the first attack, the Houthis said, but it wasn't clear if they caused casualties.

The Houthis seized large areas of Yemen, including Sanaa, earlier this year as part of a protracted power struggle with President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Their critics view them as a proxy for Shiite Iran, charges the rebels deny.

In a brief statement, Hadi vowed to chase the terrorists who carried out the attack, saying: ""They will not escape prosecution.""

Meanwhile, in the central city of Radda, a security official said series of blasts that targeted Houthi positions killed at least five people. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists.

The city has been a battleground between al-Qaida fighters and allied tribes and Houthis for the past months before the militant group's withdrawal. The group carries out near-daily attacks on Houthis.

377|Patria o Muerte: 7 Essential Cuba-Set Films|"Javier Bardem and Johnny Depp in ‘Before Night Falls’/Image © New Line Cinema

With a move meant to alleviate fifty-four years of tension, President Obama eased a number of travel and trade restrictions with the island nation of Cuba. The announcement is the first in what may be a series of moves to thaw the longtime icy relations with our Caribbean neighbor. So what more perfect time to take a look at some great films set in Cuba?

""Godfather: Part II"" (1974)

A fair portion of Francis Ford Coppola's sprawling, generation-spanning epic was set in Cuba during the close of the Cuban Revolution. In an effort to diversify the Corleone family's holdings, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino in one of his finest performances to date) travels to Havana, but soon flees as the violent fall of the Batista regime becomes more apparent. Setting the crumbling Corleone Empire against the failing Cuban government is one of the film's great allegorical moments. For obvious reasons, the Cuba scenes were not filmed on location but in the Dominican Republic.

""Before Night Falls"" (2000)

Born into the poverty of pre-Castro Cuba and sentenced to imprisonment for both his writing and sexuality in the early years of Fidel Castro's government, the journey of poet Reinaldo Arenas is a poignant and powerful rebuke of Cuba's oppressive communist regime. Javier Bardem earned an Oscar nomination for his nuanced portrayal of Arenas, who fled to the U.S. during 1980's Mariel boatlift. The film was shot primarily in Mexico and the United States. ""Before Night Falls"" was based on the autobiography of the same name.

""Scarface"" (1983)

Speaking of the Mariel boatlift, 1983's ""Scarface"" was a re-imagining of the 1932 gangster classic of the same name replacing the titular Chicago Mafioso with savage Cuban immigrant Tony Montana. With his over-the-top, scenery-chewing antics and comically exaggerated accent, Al Pacino did little to improve the image of Cubans for the majority of Americans. However, taken on its own merits, ""Scarface"" is an entertaining, coke-fueled shoot-em-up that turned a fun-house lens on the concept of the American Dream and Reagan Era capitalism. The film was shot primarily in Florida and California.

""Amistad"" (1997)

Based on the novel Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy, ""Amistad"" follows the uprising of a group of slaves aboard a Spanish slave ship and features strong performances from Matthew McConaughey, Djimon Hounsou, and Anthony Hopkins. Beginning in a slave market in Havana, the slaves are eventually re-captured and brought to trial in the United States in a case that reached the Supreme Court and proved a landmark moment for the abolitionist movement. ""Amistad"" was filmed primarily in the Northeastern United States.

""Che: Parts One and Two"" (2008)

Steven Soderbergh's treatment of the life of infamous Marxist Revolutionary Che Guevara is anchored by a stunning - and oft-overlooked performance - by Benicio del Toro. Shot in a non-linear, documentary style, the films traces the rise and eventual demise of Guevara first as a revolutionary in Fidel Castro's July 26 Movement and later as guerilla leader in Bolivia. The films make no attempt to aggrandize Guevara and instead present an unvarnished view of a passionate and perhaps misguided revolutionary. ""Che: Parts One and Two"" are based largely on the writings of Che Guevara including a daily journal he kept during his time in Bolivia. The films were shot primarily in Spain, Mexico, and Puerto Rico

""Guys and Dolls"" (1955)

A classic based on the Tony Award-winning musical that was based on the short stories ""The Idyll of Miss Sarah Browne"" and ""Blood Pressure"" by Damon Runyon, ""Guys and Dolls"" gave a view of the more idyllic, pre-revolution image of Cuba as an island paradise. Featuring Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra, ""Guys and Dolls"" was shot during the heyday of the classic Hollywood musical and represents a picturesque, fun-in-the-sun Cuba that may have been little more than an American fantasy. ""Guys and Dolls"" was shot entirely on a backlot in Hollywood, California.

""The Old Man and the Sea"" (1958)

No list of films set in Cuba would be complete without some mention of Ernest Hemingway. Written during his time living in Cuba, The Old Man and the Sea is a classic American novel and the epitome of Hemingway's sparse, harsh prose style. The 1958 adaptation starring Spencer Tracy is the tale of elderly fisherman Santiago and his struggle to capture an enormous marlin and return to shore. Generally considered one of Hemingway's finest works, The Old Man and the Sea explores themes of masculinity and sacrifice and was perhaps a window into the author's inner struggles. The film is arguably one of the truest literary adaptations ever put to film. ""The Old Man and The Sea"" was filmed primarily on location in Cuba."
378|BJP plans mega rally in Delhi to kick-start poll campaign|"New Delhi: BJP will kick-start its campaign to capture power in Delhi at a mega rally here on January 10 to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Ministers of Haryana, Jharkhand and Maharashtra where the party formed government after winning the polls recently.

The 'Abhinandan Rally', to be held at Ramlila Maidan, will also be addressed by BJP president Amit Shah and a number of other senior party leaders.

BJP Vice President in-charge of Delhi Prabhat Jha said the party's slogan for Delhi polls will be ""Ab Delhi ki bari hai (Now, it's Delhi's turn)"" after its electoral victories in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand.

""Besides Modi ji, Haryana CM ML Khattar, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das will also seek people's support for BJP. We will put up a strong fight in the polls,"" Jha said.

The announcement of the rally came a day after Shah held detailed deliberations with senior leaders of BJP's Delhi unit where he asked them to go ""all out"" to ensure a clear victory for the party in the Assembly election which is likely to be held in February.

Jha said if a BJP leader becomes Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, then he will also address the rally at the Ramlila Ground.

""In the rally, all senior leaders will appeal to the people of Delhi to support BJP in the upcoming Assembly elections,"" Jha told reporters. Exuding confidence about party's victory, Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay said people of the city will give a clear mandate and reject AAP.

Asked about AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal likening his 49-day rule to 'Ram Rajya', Upadhyay said ""people of Delhi will tell whether it was 'Ram Rajya' or 'Bhogada Rajya'"".

""We all know very well what type of 'Ram Rajya' it was. The campaign which they (AAP) are now running was also the same during Lok Sabha elections,"" he said.

Meanwhile, former Congress MLA S C Vats joined BJP along with a number of his supporters. According to BJP, DPCC secretary Sandeep Yadav, Congress leaders Ashok Kumar Gupta, Rekha Vohra, former IAS officer S P Singh and educationist B N Sharma also joined the party.

""I was very impressed by Narendra Modiji following which I am today joining the BJP unconditionally,"" Vats told reporters."
379|Who was aboard AirAsia Flight QZ8501? Families, pilots, a fiancé and more|"A man who was about to be married. Missionaries, a biology teacher and an energy executive. Families on vacation. Pilots with years of experience.

The lives of 162 people intersected Sunday on what was supposed to be a roughly two-hour AirAsia flight from Indonesia to Singapore.

Now their families are dealing with the likelihood all lives were lost, after Indonesian officials announced they’d found debris from Flight QZ8501 and some passengers’ bodies.

Many family members were seen in tears as airline CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted his condolences: “My heart is filled with sadness… words cannot express how sorry I am.”

As they wait for confirmation of the fate of their loved ones, details are emerging about the lives of the 138 adults, 16 children and one infant on board. Here’s what we know so far:

Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi

A flight attendant on the plane, Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi was adventurous and passionate about travel, according to her parents.

The 22-year-old would always call before she flew to tell her parents the route she was working, said her mother, Rohana.

Her parents heard what had happened as they were on their way to a wedding Sunday. A relative called them asking, “Where did Nisa fly?” said her father, Haidar Fauzi.

Her body was identified Friday, in part by her flight attendant’s uniform and pin. Her parents said she will be buried in her hometown of Palembang on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

Hayati Lutfiah Hamid

The first funeral for a victim from the crash was held Thursday in Surabaya, Indonesia.

Hayati Lutfiah Hamid’s body arrived by ambulance and men in uniform unloaded the coffin. Family and friends gathered to watch the coffin lowered into the ground at a cemetery. A gravestone was marked with her name and the date of December 28, 2014.

Hamid was the first crash victim identified.

Jo Indri

Jo Indri, 81, was the matriarch of her family.

Her son, Suyono Thejakusuma, starts to cry as he describes his loved ones on the AirAsia flight: Seven people in total.

“When we heard the information, first, of course, we hoped our family members were safe. We thought of nothing until yesterday morning and afternoon, we still hoped we would get a miracle, that our families are still alive, because my mother, my sister, we were very close,” he said.

Then, they got word that debris from the plane and the bodies of some passengers had been found. Now, the family says they know a miracle is unlikely.

The Le Hoa, one of Suyono’s sisters, said she’s having trouble understanding what happened.

“I ask God, why is he testing us this way, by taking them away without giving us a chance to say goodbye?” she says.

At first, Maria Endang Wirasmi didn’t want to believe her family was on the plane. But as she read through the manifest, the 65-year-old says she came to terms with a devastating reality.

“First I saw my son-in-law’s name. I didn’t tell my husband, because I didn’t want him to panic. It was only after I saw my daughter’s name and my two granddaughters’ names on the list that I told him,” she said.

Now, she says she’s dealing with the possibility that her loved ones didn’t survive the crash.

“I know this is a big tragedy, but why did this happen to my daughter? I know everyone dies when it’s time, but I believe in an afterlife, so my way to cope with my loss, I will pray more often and give this to God,” she said.

Her husband, Imam Sampurno, said he was relieved the plane had been found.

“We hope that our children will be saved by a miracle,” he said.

Sidartha, the couple’s son-in-law, was a property developer in Indonesia, Channel News Asia reported. The family was on their way to Singapore for a vacation.

Soetikno Sia, Jou Christine Yuanita, Jou Yongki, Feilensia Sularmo Go, Elisabeth Youvita, and Brian Youvito

Theresia Song spoke with her mother the night before Flight 8501 took off. Her parents, aunt, uncle and two cousins were traveling together, planning to vacation in Singapore and celebrate New Year’s there.

For days, she has been following details about the search for the plane from her home in Seattle, thousands of miles away.

On Wednesday, she said she and her brother are planning to head to the Indonesian city of Surabaya to find out more. Attempts to get help from the airline to travel there failed, she said.

“They asked for a lot of things from us, passports, birth certificates and for my uncle to go to the crisis center in Surabaya to arrange it. We got tired of waiting and decided to go on our own,” she said. “There is nothing confirmed as far as what happened to the passengers, and we are still hoping there is a miracle and they survive. I am really hoping we can find them alive.”

Kevin Alexander Soetjipto

A finance student at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, he was due to graduate next year.

He was traveling with his sister and another relative on Flight 8501.

“We are deeply saddened to learn this news in relation to one of our valued student community,” the university said in a statement. “We will be offering counseling support to Kevin’s friends and fellow classmates.”

Alain Oktavianus Siauw

Louise Sidharta, 25, was heading to the airport to pick up her fiance when she heard the news: AirAsia Flight QZ8501 was missing.

Sunday night, surrounded by television cameras, she explained that Siauw was supposed to be enjoying a family vacation before the two got married. “It was to be his last vacation with his family,” she said.

Siauw’s Facebook page says he lives in Malang, a province in Indonesia.

The couple planned to get married in May 2015.

Oei Jimmy Sentosa Winata, his wife, their 13-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter

At first, Oei Endang Sulsilowati wasn’t worried, even when she heard a plane was missing. She knew her brother usually traveled with a different airline.

“Then someone told me that she saw his name on TV. Then I saw it,” she said, weeping.

Now she says she’s looking for information about her brother, his wife and the couple’s two children.

“We don’t know what to do,” Sulsilowati said. “We are just waiting for news.”

Choi Chi Man and his 2-year-old daughter

British national Choi Chi Man was traveling on the plane with his 2-year-old daughter, Zoe, Alstom Power said on Twitter.

The 48-year-old had just started a job as an executive working for the company in Indonesia, The Independent reported. They were traveling on Flight QZ8501 because an earlier plane was full, the British newspaper said.

In his LinkedIn profile, former colleagues praised Choi for his experience in multicultural work environments, communicating well with people from different cultures.

Reggy Ardhi, Caroline Harwon Lioe, Marianne Claudia Ardhi, Michelle Clemency Ardhi and Jayden Cruz Ardhi

The Ardhi family was traveling together on the plane, planning to celebrate New Year’s in Singapore, according to Yulia Wang, principal at Surabaya Cambridge School, where Jayden, Michelle and Marianne were students.

She described Michelle as a cheerful girl, always having fun and joking with her friends.

“It’s hard to believe. Hopefully they’re safe, but I don’t know, we are just praying now,” Wang said. “Everybody is praying, including their friends.”

One student at the school, she said, tried to send a message to Marianne, asking her to turn on her GPS so she could be found.

There was no reply.

Raven Limadinata said he received a message from Michelle from inside Flight QZ8501 before it took off. Using the messaging app SnapChat, she sent a picture showing the plane’s wing, along with the caption “bye Surabaya.”

Limadinata and Michelle have been “best friends since we first met,” he said.

“She doesn’t talk a lot, but she is a smart girl,” he said.

Yuni Astutik

Astutik, 40, had worked for years as a maid in Singapore

She returned to Indonesia to attend a wedding last month, Channel News Asia reported, citing an employment agent who had traveled to the airport to give Astutik her work permit.

Park Seong Beom

A missionary who had been teaching Korean and computer skills in Indonesia, Park Seong Beom, his wife and their 11-month-old baby were on the flight, heading to Singapore to renew visas, Channel News Asia reported.

Before their arrival in Indonesia in September, they had been missionaries in Cambodia for four years.

“He had good local contacts and helped poor people in need,” Kim Jong Heon, a spokesman for Park’s church in the South Korean fishing village of Yeosu, told Channel News Asia. “He was always thinking about how to meet more locals and eventually left the country to be a lay minister.”

Florentina Maria Widodo

Andy Chen told Channel News Asia that his girlfriend, a biology teacher, was on the missing plane.

Pilot Captain Irianto

A veteran of the skies, Irianto, 53, had more than 20,000 flying hours under his belt, 6,100 of which were with AirAsia on the Airbus 320.

He was an F-16 fighter jet pilot with the Indonesian Air Force and retired early to become a commercial airline pilot, the Jakarta Post reported.

In his spare time, he was a member of a motorcycle club, according to media reports. Pictures on Facebook show the captain posing with a motorcycle.

A post on a social media account thought to belong to the pilot’s daughter, Angela Anggi Ranastianis, reads: “Dad, please come home, I still need you. Please return, Dad. Dad, come home Dad. You have to come home.”

Irianto’s wife, Rr. Widiya Sukati Putri, said she wanted to know where he was.

“I hope as his wife, he will be back well and alive. The children still need a father, I still also need guidance from a husband,” she said. “He’s a good husband in my eyes and he’s a faithful husband, a great husband. I can’t name all his qualities.”

The family, which lives in Indonesia, had recently suffered a loss. The captain’s younger brother died of diabetes just days ago.

“I want my son to come back, alive and well,” his father, Suwarto, told the BBC. “But if that’s not meant to be, if God doesn’t want that, it’s in the hands of fate.”

First Pilot Remi Emmanuel Plesel

The plane’s 46-year-old co-pilot originally hailed from the French Caribbean island of Martinique.

“Since his childhood, he wanted to be an airplane pilot,” said his mother, Rolande Plesel, according to Le Parisien.

His mother told media there that she had gotten a call from his girlfriend on Sunday with news of the missing flight.

He studied in Paris, according to French media, and had worked as an engineer for the Total oil company, but left to pursue his dream of becoming a pilot, Martinique 1ère reported.

The first officer had a total of 2,275 flying hours with AirAsia Indonesia. He was the president of a French pilot association.

He’d been working as a pilot in Indonesia for three years, Le Parisien said, and he called his family in Martinique before each flight.

On Saturday, he called them on his iPad, looking at all the family’s Christmas decorations from afar."
380|A year that will be crucial for the future of Turkey|"We have just put behind us a year that was generally a period of struggle and hardship for our country. We successfully held two important elections that all turned into a referendum for the leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who won them both with impressive victories.



At the end of the day we saw that the activities of the Gülen Movement did in fact do much harm to the security and justice system of the country and that it still can use its giant public relations apparatus successfully against the government. But we also saw that the movement seriously lacks popular support among the Turkish people. Both elections showed this as they failed to make any impact as Erdoğan won landslide victories both in the local polls and the presidential election.



Now we have entered a year that will be a period when the Turkish people will be asked to make important decisions. Are we going to preserve the status quo or are we going to revamp our political system and state structure to be able to facilitate a more modern executive system that borders on a presidential system and also create the conditions of coexistence for the various ethnic groups led by Turks and Kurds?



The reconciliation process between Turks and Kurds is progressing on course despite incredible hurdles put before it by its internal and external adversaries. However, for this process to be concluded in a satisfactory manner we need to amend our laws and, above all, we need to write a new constitution that will set the conditions of coexistence. That cannot be done with the current composition of Parliament as the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) has a good majority, but it does not have the absolute strength required to amend or rewrite the Constitution.



The ruling AK Party will seek a mandate from voters to write a new constitution that will be crucial for the future of the country in all aspects. This will be the key issue in the 2015 June parliamentary elections. The people will also decide if they want to help Erdoğan achieve his presidential system and thus revolutionize Turkey's executive system.



2015 will also be the year when Turks will set out to chart the universal divine rules and morals of coexistence of people from different faiths. This is crucial for the future of world peace where Muslims, Christians, Jews and Buddhists agree to disagree and set the conditions of living together side by side in peace and harmony in various societies like our beloved Prophet Muhammad commanded us. This will also be the greatest antidote for radical movements like the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).



Turks have completed 2014 knowing that they are among the few people in the world that still entertain feelings of compassion, tolerance, mercy and affection for fellow human beings. The government spent $5 billion from their pockets to host about 1.5 million refugees from Syria under the best conditions possible as the world looked on. That makes us all proud to be members of such a charitable, honorable and kindhearted nation. We have set an example for the whole world and we should be proud that we can still keep our heads high in a world where lust for money, passion for power and selfishness is a norm.



Happy New Year dear readers.

385|Isis militants flog man for watching porn in Syria|"Islamic State (Isis) have released photos of a man being publicly flogged for ""watching pornographic videos"".

The man, who appears to be in his 20s and is dressed in a bright red jumper, is shown being repeatedly whipped in front of a large crowd.

The punishment took place in the eastern Syrian city of Deir Ezzor, recently renamed by Islamic State al-Kheir (meaning ""goodness"").

The images show an all-male crowd, including a number of young boys, watching as an IS fighter with long hair and dressed in a grey robe strikes the man's back with a long whip.

The final photographs show the usual staged propaganda images of the victim embracing the IS fighter, who had just inflicted the punishment on him.

In the same week, three other men have been subjected to public humiliation for ""bearing false witness"" in Deir Ezzor. Photos show the men in a mock crucifixion position, with their arms stretched outwards, tied back with two sets of plastic cuffs.

Each man appears to be strung up against a telephone pylon, located in three different positions in the city.

One of the men is tied up on the hard shoulder of one of the city's main roads. Another man is tied up on a shop corner.

Several onlookers appear to have stopped to look at one of the guilty men and read the large note crudely tied around his waist. Handwritten in blue pen, an Arabic message declares that the men ""bear false witness"".

It is not known how long the men were subjected to the humiliating punishment, and their identities have not been revealed.

IS's determination to impose its radical interpretation of Shariah law has left many local civilians living in fear. Stonings, amputations, whippings and public executions have been carried out on a regular basis in IS-held provinces in Iraq and Syria."
386|Uganda: Mbabazi, Sejusa Steal 2014 Show|"opinion

In almost all respects, 2014 served us a mixed bag of intriguing political surprises.

Who would have expected that by the year's end Amama Mbabazi would no longer be prime minister or secretary general of the ruling NRM?

And who would have guessed that Gen David Sejusa, then exiled former coordinator of intelligence services, would return to the country after directing so much criticism at government?

Mbabazi's falling out with President Museveni has been the biggest political story of 2014. Once considered the second most powerful person in NRM and government after Museveni, the Kinkiizi West MP has seen his political star fade.

In the process, Museveni has spent at least Shs 75 billion, over the last 10 months, to extinguish Mbabazi's political threat and diminish his stature. Yet it seems likely that we have not seen the last of Mbabazi. On Christmas day, Mbabazi told a congregation of worshippers in his western home district of Kanungu that ""I will make an important announcement soon.""

Two days later, his lawyers said he was still the lawful secretary general despite changes to the NRM constitution made at the party's special delegates' conference last December that ousted him. The lawyers added that Mbabazi would go to work at the NRM offices along Kyadondo road on January 5. The stage is set for political fireworks.

Having kicked Mbabazi out of the way, Museveni consolidated power within the NRM by commandeering the amendment of the party constitution to give him powers to appoint the secretary general and other key positions. Using his newly acquired powers, he appointed a new team, with Kasule Lumumba as the secretary general, Richard Todwong, deputy secretary general, Rosemary Namayanja, treasurer and Dr Kenneth Omona, deputy treasurer.

In the opposition FDC, Gen Mugisha Muntu maintained his grip on the presidency despite occasional political turbulence. His main challenger, Nathan Nandala-Mafabi refused to sit back quietly, accusing the general of running down the party. But as the year ended, Muntu appeared to have emerged winner of the duel.

Meanwhile, Dr Kizza Besigye, the former party president, delved deeper into political activism, linking up with Kampala Lord Mayor, Erias Lukwago to try to shake up the political establishment. Besigye's main message in 2014 was for the opposition parties to boycott the 2016 elections as long as electoral reforms are not instituted.

As for the Uganda People's Congress, it bordered on the chaotic. Its president Olara Otunnu faced an internal revolt as members disapproved of his management style. Two of the people he sacked in 2012, David Pulkol and Edward Rurangaranga are plotting his ouster.

The Democratic Party soldiered on albeit with some unresolved matters. Norbert Mao, the president, who many expect to become the leading opposition figure once Besigye gets off the scene, was not very visible. Mao continued to face pressure from a section of party members with whom he has failed to reconcile.

Collectively, opposition parties working with the civil society spearheaded a campaign to institute electoral reforms to guarantee free and fair elections. The NRM, however, scoffed at these efforts.

Besides the happenings in the political parties, 2014 will also be defined by many other political moments. The return of Gen David Sejusa from the United Kingdom after 18 months of exile was one of the most unexpected events of the year.

Sejusa fled in April 2013 after alleging a plot to kill senior government officials opposed to a future presidency of First Son Brig Kainerugaba Muhoozi.

On December 23 during his homecoming party in Naguru, Sejusa denied he had agreed a deal with government. He said he had come back to fight oppression.

State of the parties and their rating

NRM (4/10)

The NRM spent most of 2014 trying to put its house in order. Mbabazi was thrown by the wayside and new office bearers were appointed by President Museveni. On January 3, NRM MPs plan a one week retreat at the National Leadership Institute in Kyankwanzi.

Top on the agenda will be a discussion on when to organise party primaries. The party had tentatively said the primaries will be conducted in March but some MPs want them pushed to November as they try to skirt around a legal lacuna that requires independent MPs to first resign their seats before participating in party primaries, hence triggering a by-election.

Under the law, by-elections are supposed to be held at least six or more months before the end of Parliament. If the primaries are held in November, it will mean there will be only five months left to the end of the ninth parliament, negating the need for a by-election.

With the general elections slightly over a year away, 2015 could prove to be a hectic year for Museveni. He has to fend off opposition from within (Mbabazi) and outside his party. Expect money to change hands as the president deals with the political challenges.

FDC (4/10)

The future of FDC continues to be dogged by uncertainty. Party president Gen Mugisha Muntu has held firm amid a storm started by the person he defeated in 2012, Nathan Nandala Mafabi. Mafabi continued to criticize Muntu's leadership style saying he has taken the party to the doldrums.

Yet it was not all gloom for the Najjanankumbi based party. First, it was able to win the Amuru district woman parliamentary seat in the November by-election and secondly, it organised a highly successful delegates' conference on December 5.

In 2015, the party will organise another delegates' conference to elect new members to the party's National Executive Committee which expired two years ago. 2015 will give us more clues as to whether Besigye is still interested in standing for the national presidency and if so, whether he will do so using the FDC platform.

UPC (2/10)

For UPC and Otunnu in particular, 2014 is a year worth forgetting. Several factions opposed to Otunnu's leadership continued to press for his ouster. While the party embarked on a process to re-organise its structures at the grassroots, it was riddled with reports of malpractices.

Next on the agenda is the delegates' conference and a number of people, including David Pulkol, are expected to challenge Otunnu. Given the mounting pressure for him to step aside, there is every feeling that 2015 is going to be a tough year for him. His days at the helm appear to be numbered.

DP (3/10)

As the year ends, the Democratic Party still has a lot of house cleaning to do. DP President General Norbert Mao, who was briefly hospitalized in Nairobi, has still failed to reconcile with estranged members who include; Erias Lukwago, Mathias Mpuuga and Mukono Municipality MP, Betty Nambooze.

However, DP had something to celebrate when its candidate Brenda Nabukenya beat NRM's Rebecca Nalwanga to become the Luweero Woman MP in the May by-election.

As for other 'smaller' parties, Justice Forum (JEEMA) led by Asuman Basalirwa strived to remain visible. Basalirwa, through Activists for Change (A4C), asked tough questions of government's political leadership. He also offered legal representation to some of the activists imprisoned in the course of their activities.

For the Conservative Party (CP), Uganda Federal Alliance (UFA) and People's Progressive Party (PPP), 2014 was a quiet year. Will they roar in 2015?"

New book sheds light on Liugong waterway

Publication Date: December 31, 2014

Source: Taiwan Today

Striking a balance between economic growth and quality of urban living is one of the main themes in a new book on the history of Taipei’s Liugong waterway. (Courtesy of Kuo Hsi-liu Foundation)

A recently published book is rekindling interest in one of Taiwan’s most important irrigation canals and its impact on national development since the 18th century.

“The Liugong Waterway” by Li Chung-hsin, assistant professor at the Graduate Institute of History at National Changhua University of Education, examines how the canal’s construction influenced the rise and fall of the irrigation community on the Taipei plain over the past 300 years.

“It is important to note that the watercourse influenced the urbanization of Taiwan during the Qing dynasty [1644-1911], Japanese colonial rule [1895-1945] and ROC government of today,” Li said. “This history also reflects changes in the relationships among the early residents, land and society.”

Built in the mid-18th century by the revered Kuo Hsi-liu, Liugong was one of the earliest irrigation projects in northern Taiwan. It originated in New Taipei City’s Xindian district and ran through Jingmei, Gongguan and Songshan of Taipei City.

“The irrigation system successfully transformed the Taipei plain into a major rice growing region in Taiwan, helping spur the development of Bangka and Xinzhuang districts in Taipei and paving way for the city to become the richest in Taiwan,” Li said.

But the canal fell into disuse as the country transformed from an agricultural into an industrial and technology-based economy. “The majority of the public is not fully aware of Liugong’s existence or history, and little effort has been made to retain or inject new life into the watercourse,” Li said.

The importance of waterways in contributing to urban aesthetics and quality of living is vastly underestimated in Taiwan, Li said, citing the Cheonggyecheon urban renewal project in Seoul as an example. “Liugong has the potential to become a similar source of cultural and creative inspiration.”

But before this can happen, the history of the watercourse must be appreciated, Li said. “My book urges the public to reflect on the kind of city it wants, as well as address the never-ending debate on balancing economic growth with quality of life.” (SFC-JSM)

394|Microsoft to wind down sales of original Kinect for Windows in 2015|"Now that the Kinect for Windows v2 is out, Microsoft will be selling out its stock of the first-generation motion-based controller

Microsoft will stop selling the original Kinect for Windows in 2015 now that the second generation of the motion-based controller platform is available.

In a blog post, Microsoft advised enterprises that need large numbers of the old systems for existing applications to contact the company as soon as possible.

""We will do our best to fill your orders, but no more original sensors will be manufactured after the current stock sells out,"" the Kinect for Windows Team wrote in the post.

The phase-out of the original product doesn't come as a surprise, since Microsoft introduced the Kinect for Windows v2 and a second-generation software development kit, SDK 2.0, earlier this year.

Kinect for Windows brought motion-based interaction technology to PCs and tablets, offering new ways of controlling applications beyond the typical mouse and keyboard. Kinect senses depth using twin cameras and can interpret movements and gestures.

Kinect for Windows v2 adds full 1080p video, an expanded field of view and better body tracking, among other improvements, according to Microsoft.

Gamers were the first to use Kinect when it was introduced for the Xbox 360 console in 2010. The technology has since been applied to uses in health care, retail, manufacturing and other fields.

398|Last 4 on Md. death row to have sentences commuted|"In one of his final acts as governor, Democrat Martin O'Malley announced Wednesday that he will commute the sentences of four death-row inmates to life in prison without parole.

In one of his final acts as governor, Democrat Martin O’Malley announced Wednesday that he will commute the sentences of four death-row inmates to life in prison without parole.

Two years ago, the General Assembly abolished the death penalty, leaving five inmates on death row. One of them, John Booth-El, died in prison this year.

The governor said he had met or spoken with many of the relatives of the people killed by the inmates. Some victim family members and prosecutors were upset with O’Malley’s decision.

O’Malley said that if he didn’t commute the sentences the legal process would “needlessly and callously subject survivors, and the people of Maryland, to the ordeal of an endless appeals process, with unpredictable twists and turns, and without any hope of finality or closure.”

None of the executions was imminent because the state didn’t have a procedure to carry one out.

O’Malley, who is considering running for president in 2016, will leave office next month after two terms, the limit in Maryland. The governor is a Catholic and longtime opponent of capital punishment.

“We would like to thank Gov. O’Malley for taking what was a tough and courageous moral decision,” Gary Proctor, one of the attorneys for death-row inmate Heath Burch, said in a statement. “It was indeed time that Maryland’s machinery of death was consigned to the history books.”

Mary Frances Moore, whose father and stepmother were fatally stabbed by Burch in 1995 in Capitol Heights, said she was “devastated” by the governor’s decision.

“I think he was hoping I would give him the OK on it, to give him life without parole, and I didn’t give him that,” Moore, 71, said Wednesday.

She fears a future governor could grant parole to Burch.

Matthew Maciarello, the Wicomico County state’s attorney, said O’Malley met with Dottie Atkinson — the mother of Edward Atkinson, who was killed in a 1997 robbery and murder by Jody Lee Miles in Mardela Springs on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Maciarello, who attended the meeting, said while the family believes death was the appropriate sentence, they understand the political and legal realities.

“They believe that the actions taken by the governor will provide a degree of closure that could not be achieved through protracted litigation,” Maciarello said. The family requested privacy and asked him to make a statement for them, he said.

Miles’ attorney, Robert Biddle, argued in a letter to O’Malley last month that the governor should not commute his client’s sentence because Miles deserves the opportunity to argue in court for parole. Biddle said Wednesday that Miles would not agree to the commutation, arguing that his client deserves a chance at parole because of his remorse, his “outstanding record in prison” and other factors.

Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger, a death penalty supporter, criticized the governor’s move. Two death-row inmates, Anthony Grandison and Vernon Evans, were convicted in the 1983 contract killing in Baltimore County of two witnesses who were scheduled to testify against Grandison in a federal drug case.

“Death was the decision of the jury. These sentences were lawfully imposed and upheld numerous times on appeal,” Shellenberger said in a statement. “The governor should not be using his last days in office to show any mercy to these cold, calculating killers.”

Gov.-elect Larry Hogan, a Republican who takes office Jan. 21, said he wasn’t going to second-guess the decision.

“There is only one governor at a time, and I’m not in a place to second-guess what is probably one of the most difficult decisions a governor may have to make,” Hogan said in a statement.

Only five Maryland inmates were executed since the death penalty was reinstated in 1978. The last execution was in 2005 under Republican Gov. Robert Ehrlich.

401|Likud Primaries Held Today In A Storm Of Last Minute Manuevers|"Politics is a strange game and the rules are not always so clear. Dealmakers abound, and the preparations for the upcoming elections in Israel seem to be stranger than usual. The Likud primaries are being held today in a storm of last-minute deals and negotiations.

The polls opened at 10am in 600 polling stations all over Israel. Likud, the largest single political party in Israel has approximately 95,000 members who will vote for 11 candidates.

The reality of Israeli democracy is that Kenesset seats are given out according to how many votes the party gets. That means position on the list is as important as being included on the list. With thirty-eight people vying for positions on the list, the battle for position is a battle for political life or death. Netanyahu thickened the plot by asking for two reserved spots on the list. Voters will be asked to list 11 names as their choices.

Internal conflicts have heated to the point where police were called in today to break up a riot that broke out in front of the Tel Aviv Convention center polling station. Though Netanyahu is sitting pretty as the uncontested leader of Likud and frontrunner for the prime minister position, just below the surface is a party in turmoil.

Likud is divided by special interest groups who may vote in the primaries, but may not vote for Likud in the general elections. The settlers represent about ten percent of their voters and fall under this category. They represent a significant percentage of their support so Likud politicians are influenced by their demands. Minister Katz has support from industries and labor groups that rely upon him for employment, giving him a powerbase that is difficult to contend with.

Likud has undergone many changes in cast. Most recently, Limor Livnat, a veteran and strong figure in the party, retired from politics. Other members who have left the party in recent years were Dan Meridor, Benni Begin, and Michael Eitan. The party was also weakened when Moshe Kahlon broke off to form his own party.

Gilad Erdan and Yisrael Katz are competing for the number two position, a place that has been held by Gideon Sa’ar for the last two elections but who has since left politics.

Yisrael Katz was most threatened by Gilad Erdan, MK Yariv Levin and Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein, who were in a position to win higher positions on the list than Katz. Katz seems to have benefited from Yaakov Veider’s intervention when he, as head of the Charedi faction in Likud, submitted a list of their choices that excluded Edelstein.

Small actions can have enormous outcomes, and Yaakov Veider certainly knows that. Veider is a power behind the scenes and a close friend of Bibi Netanyahu, Moshe Feiglin, Dani Danon, and Yisrael Katz. His actions, however subtle, are significant. His choices for the Likud list were notable more for those who were excluded than those included.

For the Likud primaries, he was required to choose eleven names. The ones he chose were as follows: Ophir Ekonis, Gila Gamliel, Dani Danon, Tzachi Hanegbi, Amir Veitman, Yisrael Katz, Yariv Levine, Shai Malka, Moshe Feiglin, Shevach Shtern, and Silvan Shalom.

In a savvy political maneuver, the list was bloated with names of candidate that stood no chance of being elected. This pushed out some who are serious figures in Likud politics, but whom Veider apparently wanted off the list. Glaringly absent was the name of Yuli Edelstein. Also glaringly absent were Yaalon, Miri Regev, and Shteinitz.

This changes the balance of Likud, making it slightly more religious, but certainly and significantly more right-wing, pro-settler. This maneuver came at an especially significant time; less than one day before the Likud primaries. There is little time for changes or adjustments.

The road to the primaries this year has been paved with much conflict, in-fighting, and conflict. Parties have rearranged themselves with strange alliances in order to take advantage of the dynamic situation. We have seen Shas fall apart, Bayit Hayehudi bring in outside forces, and the Charedi sector is scrambling not to be left out in the cold.

Apparently the Likud voters, despite being the strongest party with the largest electorate, are not content. Today, police were called in to break up a riot that began outside the voting center at the Tel Aviv Convention Center."
402|CDC determines influenza at epidemic levels|"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that influenza levels across the nation have hit epidemic levels and are continuing to rise.

One reason, the CDC warns, is that the flu vaccine isn’t as effective this year.

“Unfortunately, about half of the H3N2 viruses that we’ve analyzed this season are different from the H3N2 virus that’s included in this year’s flu vaccine,” said CDC director, Tom Frieden. “They are different enough that we’re concerned that protection from vaccinations against these drifted H3N2 viruses may be lower than we usually see.”

The CDC also warns that the strain circulating is linked to a more severe flu than usual, and results in more hospitalizations and deaths.

Rebecca Ward, health educator for the Utah Department of Health, said nationally, about two-thirds of the influenza A, or H3N2 viruses analyzed since Oct. 1 are genetically different from the H3N2 vaccine virus component this season. This year’s “drift” in the H3N2 viruses wasn’t detected until March, too late to make it into this year’s batch of vaccines. However, vaccination will still offer some protection from three other strains as well as flu-related complications, so if you haven’t been vaccinated yet, get it done, Ward said.

In the past week, states reporting high influenza activity has jumped from 13 to 22. According to UDOH, 316 Utahns have been hospitalized with influenza and pneumonia.

“On just Sunday alone, we saw 252 patients with flu-like symptoms,” said McKay-Dee Hospital public relations director Chris Dallin. “This month we’ve been up 48.6 percent from last year.”

Ogden Regional Medical Center is seeing about the same number as last year, but Davis Hospital and Medical Center is also reporting an increase.

“Flu numbers are definitely high right now. We are currently seeing more patients than we did one and two months ago,” said Ben Sprague, emergency department clinical coordinator for Davis Hospital.

Ward said Utah hasn’t seen any pediatric deaths so far. However, 15 children have died nationwide. When the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia reach 6.8 percent, the CDC considers it to be at an epidemic level.

Flu strains are constantly mutating, the CDC states. Early in the year, scientists predict which strains they believe should be incorporated into a vaccine for the coming flu season. Influenza usually peaks in January.

If you do get the flu, Sprague said to ask your doctor for an antiviral as soon as possible. Then stay home and stay hydrated.

“Also, everyone should be careful and wash their hands often, use hand sanitizer and cover your cough,” he said."
403|Family 'shamed' on Facebook by Burger & Lobster pay up after online row|"Family 'shamed' on Facebook by restaurant for walking out without settling the bill pay up after online row

Burger & Lobster posted photo of family online and claimed they didn't pay

Trendy chain said family of four left Cardiff restaurant without settling bill

Facebook users hit out at chain for posting CCTV photo and accusing them

But others said staff were right to 'publicly shame' family if bill wasn't paid

A family shamed by a trendy restaurant on social media for walking out without paying their bill have now settled their tab.

Burger & Lobster posted a CCTV picture on its company Facebook page showing a mystery family apparently leaving its new restaurant in The Hayes, Cardiff.

Next to the photograph, a staff member wrote: 'To this family that walked out tonight without paying their bill, we are sure this was just a 'mistake' and you completely forgot, so out of the goodness of your heart please call the restaurant tomorrow to pay the bill. Thanks.'

Burger & Lobster posted this CCTV picture on its company Facebook page showing a mystery family walking out of its new restaurant in The Hayes, Cardiff. In the caption, staff claimed the group did not pay their bill

The post, which appeared on Facebook this week, triggered a flood of protests from other customers who were furious at the family being 'shamed' in public over the apparent bill blunder.

However, Burger & Lobster insisted today that the post was 'made with the intention of encouraging the guest in question to come back and pay for their mistake to rectify the loss for the business.'

A spokesman said the family had now settled the tab for their meal – which is thought to have cost in the region of £80.

The spokesman said: 'It wasn't done with the purpose of naming and shaming anyone as we are well aware that these things happen.

'As a company we take our social media policy seriously - it was posted at a local level and has now been removed.

'The table in question has now come forward and paid their bill so thank you to those who provided us with any information.

'We have taken the decision to donate the money from the bill payment to the charity Safer Wales.'

The CCTV picture posted by Burger & Lobster on Facebook showed a man dressed in a smart grey suit jacket and jeans, a woman in a dress with a thick overcoat and two other women dressed in black trousers, scarves and coats. They appeared to be leaving the city centre restaurant.

More than 600 people commented on the image that was available for the restaurant's 3,200 fans, before the food chain deleted it.

The restaurant chain accused the family of walking out of its Burger & Lobster branch in Cardiff (above)

It sparked fury among diners, with some blasting the restaurant - which offers either burger or lobster with sides - for the 'very public shaming' of the unnamed family.

Francesca Coles, a regular customer at the trendy chain said: 'People make mistakes like this all the time, especially if there is a few of them.

'I've had to go back and pay after leaving and realising. Not a very professional approach by this food chain if these customers have left in error!

'I don't like the way in which you operate and puts me off ever coming into your establishment again! Disgusting!'

Fellow customer Oliver Price said: 'Genuinely a disgrace posting this on a social media platform.

'If this is a mistake and they come back and pay how are you going to 're-inform' everyone who saw this that they made a genuine error. Terrific social faux par here.'

Mink Kleekai added: 'Disgraceful action by the restaurant, they have given this family little time to make amends before trying to publicly shame them on social media.

'Totally unprofessional management of this situation, which makes you wonder if the front and back of house are also mismanaged.'

However, while several people appeared to be against the restaurant's actions, some customers supported the post.

Chris George said: 'People moaning about the photo annoys me! If they paid there want be a problem!! 100 people prob went to that restaurant and didn't have their photo put on Facebook cause they paid for their meal!!! (sic).'

Kristen McDougal said: 'You did 100 per cent the right thing by posting the photos,' while Tom Weaver simply added: 'You did right.'

The Cardiff city centre restaurant has only been open for a month and, in line with other Burger & Lobster restaurants in the country, has just three items on the menu - a burger, lobster or a lobster roll with fries and salad.

Everything at the restaurant costs £20 so it's likely the family's bill came to around £80, or slightly more with drinks.

It is likely the family of four spent about £80 at the Cardiff city centre restaurant because everything at the trendy chain - which only offers burger or lobster - costs £20. Burger & Lobster also has branches in London

The first Burger & Lobster opened in Mayfair, London, in December 2011 and it was followed by a second, larger restaurant in Soho in July the following year.

It has since opened several other branches in the capital in Farringdon, Bread Street, Fitzrovia and on the fifth floor of Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge.

The Cardiff restaurant, the most recent to be opened by the chain, is the first UK branch to be unveiled outside of London.

The only other branch of Burger & Lobster, which is operated by Russian steakhouse group Goodman Restaurants, is the American flagship in New York - which came after its success in Britain.

The trendy chain boasts on its website as offering 'some of the best lobster around for just £20', and aims to appeal to customers by having no menu."
404|Merkel urges Germans to shun anti-Muslim protesters and welcome refugees of conflict|BERLIN, Dec 31 (Reuters): Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to turn their backs on a growing grass-roots movement of anti-Muslim protesters, calling them racists full of hatred, and said Europe's biggest economy must welcome people fleeing conflict and war. In an unusually strongly worded New Year address that also condemned Russia for its actions in Ukraine, Merkel said it was essential for Germany to help the children of persecuted people to grow up without fear. Many Germans are worried about a flood of asylum seekers, many from Syria, pouring into the country. A new movement, Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA), is holding weekly rallies in the eastern city of Dresden. Referring to protests that took place before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Merkel said,“Today many people are again shouting on Mondays: 'We are the people'. But in fact they mean: You do not belong - because of the colour of your skin or your religion. ”So I say to everyone who goes to such demonstrations: Do not follow those who are appealing to you! Because too often there is prejudice, coldness, even hatred, in their hearts.” Partly in response to its Nazi past, German asylum rules are among the most liberal in the world. Asylum granted elsewhere had helped many opponents of the Nazi regime to survive. The number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany has surged to about 200,000 this year, four times the numbers in 2012. Net immigration has hit a two-decade high. Consequently, immigration has moved up on the political agenda. Some members of Merkel's conservative bloc worry that they risk losing support if they do not respond to voter fears. Growing support for PEGIDA's marches - a week ago more than 17,000 attended - and the popularity of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party since it shifted its focus from euro-scepticism to immigration is causing shockwaves in Berlin. Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, also reiterated that Russia had questioned the foundation of Europe's peaceful order - self-determination - with its actions in Ukraine. She said Europe would not allow Russia to abuse human rights.

The tenure of Radhakrishnan as ISRO chief, Secretary, Department of Space and Chairman, Space Commission was extended by four months in August this year till December 31, 2014 on ""functional grounds and in public interest.""



Radhakrishnan, a recipient of Padma- Bhushan, the third highest civilian award, was recently chosen as one of the top ten scientific personalities in 2014 by Nature Science Journal.



After completing his graduation in Electrical Engineering from Kerala University, he joined Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in 1972 and rose through the ranks, in brisk space.



Radhakrishnan was handpicked by Prof. Satish Dhawan - the then Chairman of ISRO, to control and monitor the Budget and Economic Analysis activities at the ISRO headquarters.



He never looked back since then and the acme of his achievement was the ""Mangalyaan"" mission to the red planet.



India made space history on September 24 when its low-cost Mars spacecraft was successfully placed in orbit around the red planet in its very first attempt, breaking into an elite club of three nations.



The Rs 450-crore MOM Mangalyaan is the cheapest inter- planetary mission that, at just USD 74 million, costing less than the estimated USD 100 million budget of the sci-fi blockbuster ""Gravity"" and a tenth of NASA's Mars mission Maven, entered the Martian orbit on September 22.



European, American and Russian probes have managed to orbit or land on the planet, but after several attempts.



MOM feat gave a boost to India's global standing in space.



Mangalyaan was named among the best inventions of 2014 by TIME magazine which described it as a technological feat that will allow India to flex its ""interplanetary muscles.""



Describing Radhakrishnan as a 'Man of Steel', ISRO said he is an efficient engineer, ""magnificent"" manager, an impeccable institution builder and an inspiring leader.



It said ""Team ISRO is determined - to strive harder to match the standard that he set and of course carry the organisation to much higher level from here.""



""Sir, it has really been an honour for all of us to be a part of your team - wishing you the very best for all your future endeavours!"" ISRO said addressing Radhakrishnan.



Radhakrishnan served as Director of NRSA (National Remote Sensing Agency) and Director of VSSC (Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre).



After delivering five consecutive successful PSLV missions, including the PSLV-C11 that lofted Chandrayaan-1, India's unmanned mission to the Moon, and leading several crucial technology development at VSSC, Radhakrishnan took over the reins of Indian Space Programme in November 2009.



With the 12 successful PSLV missions, the successful GSLV with indigenous cryogenic stage, the Mars Orbiter Mission, the LVM-3 experimental flight with CARE module, the six INSAT/GSAT satellites, three navigation satellites and six Earth Observation satellites (including RISAT-1, the first microwave imaging satellite) Dr. Radhakrishnan is leaving ISRO ""at its most glorified pedestal ever"", ISRO said.



During his brief stint from 2000-05 at the Ministry of Earth Science, Radhakrishnan is credited for establishing the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) and India's Tsunami Warning Centre."
406|Brynn Tannehill|"When Leelah Alcorn died between Dayton and Cincinnati, she left behind a note on Tumblr that was a wake-up call to the world regarding what it means to be a transgender youth in a conservative Christian family.

That reality is every bit as ugly as you would imagine. When I first saw this incident and the message she left behind, I desperately hoped it was a hoax. It was all too perfectly awful to be true. This happened only a few miles from where I live, and via my work with PFLAG Dayton, I know just how bad things are for transgender youth in the Dayton area.

Tragically, it was true. It is also the reality for most transgender youth in homes where their identities are denied.

Her family rejected her gender identity and made it clear that being loved and accepted was conditional. They put her in Christian ""reparative therapy."" They systematically cut her off from her social-support networks. They denied her the medical care she begged for. In fact, they did everything their Christian leaders command parents of transgender children to do.

Statistically, though, her parents did just about everything possible to maximize the risk of self-harm.

When other fundamentalist Christians deny medically necessary care to their children and they die as a result, they go to prison. Missouri law defines child neglect as ""the failure to provide, by those responsible for the care, custody, and control of a child under the age of eighteen years, the care reasonable and necessary to maintain the physical and mental health of the child"" and is also punishable with years in prison, even if the child doesn't perish. But somehow, despite everything, the state will not recognize what happened to Leelah as neglect.

When the child is transgender, the parents are Christian, and the dangers of their rejection and medical neglect are well known, that medical neglect is still 100-percent legal, because we don't want to ""interfere with their religion."" Because ""common sense"" says medical care for transgender people isn't necessary. Because growing up to be transgender is a ""bad outcome."" Because transgender people who transition go to hell for defying the will of God. Because parents of transgender children are told over and over again by religious authorities that they risk going to hell too if they recognize their child's gender identity.

And here's where I get really angry. Here's where I speak truth to power, because I no longer care if I'm seen as an angry transgender woman. We have three beautiful children, and the thought of one of them dying the way Leelah did in so much pain and despair makes me want to vomit and cry all at once.

So I say: Not one more! I will not be silent. I will not pull my punches. The time for words has passed, and only deeds matter.

The vast majority of religions in the U.S. reject transgender identities. Homes that deny transgender identities result in a suicide-attempt rate that's 14 times higher than in homes where such identities are accepted. If you belong to a religion that denies transgender identities and put money in the collection plate or pay your 10-percent tithe, you are bankrolling the slaughter of innocents. You can claim you love LGBT people all day, but as long as you're footing the bill for propaganda that's literally killing children, you are an accessory.

Even worse are certain non-transgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals who have fought tooth and nail against subjecting youths to reparative therapy to change their sexual orientation but refuse to denounce subjecting kids to reparative therapy to change their gender identity. They hedge their bets and say that ""all the evidence isn't in yet."" Never mind the fact that this is the same argument used by opponents of marriage equality.

Let me make this perfectly clear: I will never again give a free pass to supposed LGB allies who are hypocritical enough to slam reparative therapy on non-transgender LGB teens as torture but shrug and walk away when it comes to the same methods being used on transgender children. To them I say: You too are an accessory.

We will not be silent any longer.

The answer is to get transgender youths out of homes where they are rejected and denied the medical care they need. The state is unwilling to define reparative therapy and denial of medical care as abuse. We cannot change what religious leaders are preaching, nor do our voices carry enough weight to effectively gainsay their religious messaging and consistently convince parents to ignore religious leaders and accept their child's gender identity.

A radical new direction is needed.

Therefore, I propose an emancipation project. The goals are simple:

Give LGBT youths the legal help needed to emancipate themselves as minors via a pro-bono legal network. Provide affirming homes via a network of volunteers waiting for them after emancipation. Ensure that affirming homes for transgender children are in states where transgender-specific medical care is required to be part of insurance plans.

The LGBT movement has been looking for the next big thing after marriage. It has been beating its head against a wall of deep-red conservative legislatures. Here is something that can be done that is tangible, measurable, and desperately needed. Implementing such an effort would certainly be a huge endeavor, fraught with legal hurdles and financial challenges.

We have to stop giving money to organizations that spread the message that transgender identities aren't real. We must be willing to point out the hypocrisy of giving money to organizations promoting narratives that kill transgender children. We must forcefully speak out as one against efforts to change gender identity or God-shame transgender kids back into the closet, and call out those non-transgender LGB people who do not. We will get transgender youths into environments where their identities are accepted and they can receive medically necessary care.

It will be difficult, and it will bruise a lot of egos along the way, but we have to try.

We keep saying trans lives matter. Let's act like it for a change.

Microsoft has announced a further Windows 10 reveal event for January 21st 2015. The press event will be a daylong function and will take place at the Redmond, Washington campus of Microsoft. The event will serve as a press reveal of sorts and will offer the media ""more details on the Windows 10 consumer experience."" The event is titled ""Windows 10: The Next Chapter"" and it has quickly become the center of speculation surrounding possible details on the operating system for the New Year.



This past year Microsoft announced that it was developing Windows 10 and would have it ready for release in 2015. Judging obviously by the name of the OS Microsoft somewhat unceremoniously skipped over the release of a Windows 9. It makes one think of Apple's release of Final Cut Pro X after Final Cut Pro 7.



Gartner analyst Michael Silver said ""Microsoft can't make a big bang and talk about a new version of Windows in September with the holidays coming and consumers deciding that 'if Windows 10 is coming, I'm just going to wait and not buy a PC.'""

Originally Microsoft held a September 30th event to announced and tease Windows 10 to the professional public and business minded media. They previewed applications for the professional marketplace as well as some of the experiences that corporate users can expect out of Windows 10.





A Microsoft spokesperson has confirmed that they keynote will be publicly webcast similar to other product launches earlier in the year. Microsoft will be on the spot during the event to showcase the strongest parts of Windows 10, and convince both consumers and investors that a new Windows can fair better than Windows 8, which boldly changed its GUI to the point of consumer contention.



Will Windows 10 be impressive enough to turn around falling PC hardware sales?

409|Guns N' Roses' Slash files for divorce from Perla Ferrar|"Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash files for divorce from Perla Ferrar for the second time in four years

Slash has filed for divorce from his wife - for the second time in four years.

The 49-year-old rocker submitted court documents seeking to end his 13-year marriage to Perla Hudson in Los Angeles on Tuesday shortly after she issued him with an ultimatum to clean up his act.

The former Guns N' Roses star - whose real name is Saul Hudson - cited irreconcilable differences and listed their date of separation as June 15th in his legal documents.

It's over... again! Slash has filed for divorce from wife Perla Ferrara, four years after he initially filed for divorce but withdrew the petition

He has also requested joint physical and legal custody of their sons, 12-year-old London and 10-year-old Cash, according to gossip website TMZ.com.

Perla, 39, unexpectedly flew to Hawaii with their children on Sunday after threatening to end their marriage unless Slash agreed to sort out their problems by the beginning of 2015.

The former couple have had many arguments during their marriage but one source recently said: 'This time it's different.'

Back on: Perla and Slash, pictured here in September 2011, renewed their wedding vows that year after her filed for divorce and later called it off in 2010

Happily married: Perla and Slash, pictured here last year, were enjoying being back together just last year but now she is said to have fled for Hawaii for some 'time alone'

And the flame-haired beauty has been filling up her social media feeds with messages about 'being alone' and 'taking time' while her husband is missing from the holiday snaps.

Among the inspirational messages was one that read: 'Why would I want to be alone with my thoughts? Have you heard some of the s**t that comes out of my mouth? I'm f***ing nuts!!' alongside a caption saying, 'self professed... #iwarnedyou'

Only days before, she'd shared a happy family picture featuring Slash and her two sons, which was captioned, 'Another late post of my beautiful family. Happy holidays everyone!'

Beautiful family: Perla (left) shared a picture on Christmas Eve with the whole family, including Slash and sons London and Cash

Some time away: Perla spent the post-Christmas period sharing inspirational messages about 'being alone' and 'taking time'

The mother-of-two was clearly feeling a little pleased with herself when she'd taken herself away from the family home however, when she shared a picture with the message 'Take time to do what makes your soul happy.'

This isn't the first time the couple's marriage has hit the rocks.

In 2010, Slash filed for divorce from his wife - who is also his manager and runs all his companies - but he withdrew the petition two months later when he and Perla worked things out.

Only one year before, Slash had openly thanked his wife - who he initially met backstage at a Guns N' Roses gig - and family for helping him get 'rid of all the real hardcore stuff that [he] used to live on.'

He later told the Telegraph that he'd quit alcohol, drugs and smoking because 'the missus was bugging [him] about it.’

410|Beer deliveryman tackles would-be robber|"CANBERRA, Australia - The elevation of Wyatt Roy to Junior Minister in the new Turnbull government is widely seen as a reward for Roy's support for last week's leadership challenge.



Regardless of the motivation, the move is a giant plus for the new generations coming through. The widely discussed elevation of three women from the backbench to the ministry was seen as a victory for women (there are now 5 in the ministry), although Turnbull conceded he would like to have seen the representation greater.



Nowhere in the thinking of any of the major parties though is there any regard for the representation of youth. Politicians in Australia, and indeed globally, are rarely elected in their 20s, and most that serve in ministries are well into their 40s, 50s and 60s, and even 70s.



Yet, according to the latest statistics, Australians under 24 account for almost a third (31.3%) of the country's population of just under 24 million.



The vast majority of these until now had no representation, they don't even have a vote.



Wyatt Roy was born in 1990 and has been a Federal Member of the House of Representatives since 2010. At 20 he was the youngest politician to be elected in the history of the Australian parliament. on Monday he became the youngest minister ever.



At last it would seem the younger generations, the future of Australia have representation in the government.



Roy is already having an impact. He recently hosted a forum on youth unemployment in his electorate. he got Scott Morrison along for the day along with regional job service providers and employment agencies at Caboolture. ""Youth employment is such an important issue to me, which is why I invited a senior cabinet minister to conduct a workshop with great local organisations including Beacon Foundation and Noffs Queensland,"" Roy said at the time.



Now with more clout as a junior minister Roy could make more inroads. This week he was sworn in as Assistant Minister for Innovation, a subject he appears to be well schooled in. In July, along with the ALP's Ed Husic, who was also elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, Roy visited Boston at the invitation of Microsoft on an innovation and technology study tour.



The pair looked hard at Boston and how its economy was being battered by international competition and local overseas outsourcing.



""With one in three Bostonians aged between 20 and 34, there was the added concern about future employment prospects for its young. The city didn't take long to conclude it needed to act laterally to refashion its economic focus and priorities,"" the pair wrote in an op-ed for The Australian on their return home.



""Boston embraced innovation, technology and entrepreneurialism as a pathway to future growth. Some key elements were already sitting there: a young populace, the core academic pillars of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and businesses eager to pursue future opportunities.""



""Importantly, for two Australian politicians visiting Boston, representing different political parties what stood out was the fact Republicans and Democrats elbowed aside partisan differences for the long-term betterment of the economy and community,"" Roy and Husick penned



""Through their efforts, Boston and Massachusetts are seeing impressive job growth and revitalisation, with neighbourhoods also benefiting from a more inclusive approach to encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship.""



The unlikely duo looked at what could be learned in what had occurred in Boston, and Massachusetts as a whole, and how those lessons could be adapted to benefit Australia.



In their op-ed article they set out how Australia could innovate.



""Although conventional thinking would dictate otherwise, we believe it is our obligation to the next generation of Australians to move away from kneejerk political partisanship towards a longer view that embraces opportunities for collaborative policymaking,"" they wrote.



""It can and must start now, to ensure we extend a remarkable quarter-century of uninterrupted economic growth by nurturing a start-up ecosystem that allows new enterprises to emerge and drive new opportunity.""



""As a nation, our potential is limitless. Australia boasts an abundance of young, smart individuals and a lifestyle the envy of the world. We have an ever-deepening relationship with our neighbours in the powerhouse Asian economies around which the future of regional economic prosperity will be shaped, Roy and Husic wrote.



""As two innovation advocates from opposite sides of the parliament, we recognise this will require national leadership: across parliament, business, in science and higher education communities, and the media.""



""We agree new policies are required to change our culture, some of which we've started to see emerge. At their philosophical heart, these should acknowledge that risk and failure are not attributes to be mitigated against but essential to developing entrepreneurial spirit and culture,"" said Roy and Husic.



""We need new approaches to help attract significant capital to enable Australian start-up businesses turn far-fetched ideas into economic and commercial reality.""



""We need to enhance our own skills base so the next generation of Australians has every opportunity to fully participate in and benefit from the changing economy,"" wrote the visitors.



""And we should actively reach out to the best and brightest from across the globe, ""on-shoring"" entrepreneurial talent to team with local talent in developing and promoting our next big ideas.""



""Finally, we must generate greater co-operation between research, business and government on commercialisation, with the measure of success moving beyond just research for research's sake to the high-water mark of transforming ideas into reality,"" Roy and Husic enthused



""If we can get this right, the next generation of Australians can be assured of a sustained trajectory of rising job opportunities and living standards.""



""Above all, we agree that as policymakers we must not let fear define our response to the new age of technology disruption via hasty and heavy-handed reactive regulation,"" said the pair.



""We must be prepared to collaborate, experiment, innovate and, more important, act.""



Roy now has been given the tools to project the ideas he and Husic have put together and with Husic's support they may yet win bipartisan support in their quest to innovate Australia.



Roy has been long involved in the tech sector and has forged relationships with a number of industry leaders locally and has visited successful companies in Silicon Valley, New York and Israel as well as Boston. He's also made it known he wants to stop the movement overseas of some of Australia's tech whiz kids, and maybe even get back some of the 25,000-odd Australians working in Silicon Valley.



He will no doubt too want to tap the magnetism of Ireland, in particular Dublin which has been dubbed the Silicon Valley of Europe. Major international tech firms such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo and others have set up their global headquarters in Dublin or other parts of Ireland. While their prime motivation in moving to Ireland was driven by major tax concessions the irish government introduced to promote its economy, the mere environment that has been created is now of significanct importance. The pool of talent locally in the small nation (population 4.6 million) is huge and much of the youth in the country is now focusing their education towards the technology ecosystem.



Roy will find it hard to compete, a) because Australia is coming from behind, way behind, and b) because of Ireland's 2.5% tax rate for tech companies. While some feel Ireland has given away its soul for a lower tax rate they forget the 2.5% is on the entire worldwide profits of these huge tech conglomerates, which rank among the largest corporations in the world. And after all, 2.5% of tens of billions of dollars each year, as opposed to 100% of nothing is the reason Ireland is being so generous. (Big News Network)."
411|2014, a mixed bag for armed forces|"2014, a mixed bag for armed forces

During the year, defence forces launched gigantic rescue and relief operations in Jammu and Kashmir following the devastating floods and in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha after cyclone 'Hudhud' besides being the first to reach out to Maldives after it lone desalination unit caught fire.

NEW DELHI: As armed forces grappled with steep rise in terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir in 2014 amid heightened tension along the border with Pakistan , fresh breeze blew across the corridors of defence ministry which saw the new government pushing for faster acquisition process.

The year was also marked by the resignation of then Navy chief admiral DK Joshi following a spate of mishaps under his watch while the army got its new chief general Dalbir Singh, whose appointment by UPA government kicked up a row with BJP saying the matter should have been left to the new dispensation.

But one thing that stood out this year was the new government's pledge to fast track the defence acquisition process in a transparent manner while promoting domestic military industry.

Defence proposals worth Rs 1.50 lakh crore were cleared by the Narendra Modi government since it came in power in May.

The ball was set rolling by Arun Jaitley, who was holding the additional charge of defence ministry apart from his finance portfolio.

In its first few days in office, the Modi government hiked the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in defence to 49 per cent from the earlier 26 per cent and significantly pruned the list of defence items whose production requires manufacturing licences.

It also lifted an earlier three year lock-in period for foreign investment in defence sector.

The NDA government is stressing on indigenisation of the military industry given that India has to import 70 per cent of its defence hardware.

The slew of decisions brought cheers to the Armed Forces which has been facing an uphill task in its modernisation process.

""The armed forces is not looking at the value of decisions taken. The high figure of value is because some major projects have been cleared. But we are happy to note the number of decisions that have been taken on the modernisation front,"" a top defence official said about the new government.

However, a major foreign defence player cautioned, ""We should also see how many deals have actually being firmed up. Mere decisions alone cannot work in long term.""

But the Indian domestic industry is happy that ""Make in India"" became the buzzword in the corridors of MoD.

Under Jaitley, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) cleared an IAF proposal for issuance of a tender for construction of 56 transport aircraft to replace the force's fleet of Avro aircraft. This is seen as a significant project in which the private sector would be the sole player and lead to capacity-building in the private sector."

So much made Americans mad in 2014! Ray Rice. GamerGate. Bill Cosby. Ferguson. The NYPD. North Korea. That one Discovery Channel special that promised to show a man getting eaten by an anaconda but then didn’t. For each day of the year, Slate found a piece of news that people were mad about and put it on a calendar. Then we asked readers to vote: Was each controversy truly outrageous, or was it overblown?

After 316,000 votes, about 54 percent of the controversies on the calendar were deemed outrageous by a majority. Those with the highest percentage of outrageous votes were:

5. May 1: Three NYPD officers are accused of drunken shooting incidents in a single week. (98 percent outrageous)

4. March 25: Colorado 9-year-old is not allowed to attend school because she shaved her head in solidarity with her friend, who has cancer. (98 percent outrageous)

3. Oct. 25: Iran sentences a woman who killed her alleged rapist to death. (98 percent outrageous)

414|Dainesha Stevens, Maryland mom, accused of leaving tot on Ohio porch; boy feared dead|"COLUMBUS, Ohio - A mother accused of abandoning a 14-month-old Maryland boy on the front porch of a stranger's home in central Ohio is scheduled for arraignment Wednesday on a child endangerment charge as police searching for the toddler warn he may be dead.

Columbus officers searched Tuesday near a creek with a dive team and helicopter after Dainesha Stevens allegedly admitted she and a male acquaintance left the boy, Cameron Beckford, on Friday night because they could no longer care for him. The area being searched on the city's far east side is more than 2 miles from the home where Stevens said she left the child.

It is now considered a recovery effort because of information obtained by investigators, said Sgt. Rich Weiner, a Columbus police spokesman.

Stevens on Monday reported that Cameron's 6-year-old sister had been taken to an unknown location by a friend, and investigators determined the toddler was missing while questioning the woman, police said.

The woman told police she had left her home in Maryland with the two children to visit a friend in Columbus, reports the Columbus Dispatch.

The girl was later was found at a home on the city's west side and is in good condition, authorities said. She has been turned over to Franklin County Children Services.

Stevens is scheduled for arraignment in Franklin County Municipal Court on the child endangerment charge, a felony. She's also facing another felony charge of tampering with evidence. She remains in custody, and online court records listed no attorney for her.

Police said Stevens had legal custody of both children. The male, who police aren't identifying, was jailed on unrelated warrants.

A missing-child alert said the toddler was wearing a puffy black coat, gray pants, black and red boots and a gray elephant hat. Police say he's black with brown eyes and a Mohawk hairstyle.

Police in Frederick, Md., said the father of the two children called police on Sunday and reported that their mother had taken them to an unknown location in Columbus in mid-December. Based on the father's concerns, missing-child reports were issued."
415|With new year comes new obstacle to voting in Texas|"Texas has among the lowest rates of voter participation in the country. And, starting midnight Wednesday, those looking to change that will face yet another obstacle.

To register voters in the Lone Star State, you have to be certified by your county—a process that includes attending a training session. And at the start of every odd-numbered year—that is, this Thursday morning—those certifications expire, meaning anyone who wants to continue to do voter registration must go through the time-consuming training process again.

RELATED: Coming soon to a classroom near you: Texas conservatism

That requirement, combined with other strict rules governing registration imposed in recent years, adds an enormous hurdle for groups conducting registration drives.

“No other state requires volunteers to jump through these hoops, just to register voters,” said Jenn Brown, the executive director of Battleground Texas, a Democratic group that’s working to register and mobilize new voters in the state. The restrictions, Brown added, “seem designed to keep eligible voters away from the polls.”

To understand just what those hoops are, you have to consider the full range of requirements the state imposes on those simply looking to help their fellow citizens register and vote.

Since the 1980s, Texas has required anyone registering voters be certified as a Volunteer Deputy Registrar (VDR), and be re-certified every two years. After the passage of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which aimed to make registration easier, many states dropped those certification requirements as inconsistent with the spirit of the federal law. Texas didn’t.

Then in 2011, the state made the process even trickier. First, Republican lawmakers passed new rules barring non-Texas residents from doing voter registration, which made it harder for outside groups to come into the state and run registration drives. They also added a training requirement to the VDR certification process, and imposed criminal penalties for any group that pays registrars. This was the same legislative session in which lawmakers passed the strictest voter ID law in the country—later struck down as a poll tax by a federal judge—as well as a redistricting plan that was found by a court to have intentionally discriminated against Hispanics.

RELATED: How many voters were disenfranchised by Texas’ ID law?

As if that wasn’t enough, the Secretary of State announced that year that VDRs would now need to be deputized individually in each county for which they were registering voters. That means that if a VDR encounters voters from different counties at the same event, he or she needs to have been certified in each of those counties in order to register them, or faced criminal penalties.

Some counties hold relatively frequent training sessions at convenient hours. But others hold them only once a month, in the middle of the day.

At a training for registrars run by Hidalgo County in the heavily Hispanic Rio Grande Valley and attended by msnbc in April, Battleground volunteers were warned that failing to turn in registration forms within five days was a criminal offense.

“Between the county-by-county requirement and the training requirement, that made the sunset requirement suddenly much more burdensome,” explained Mimi Marziani, a lawyer for Battleground Texas, which says it has around 9,000 VDRs who now will need new training and certification.

Barbara Mason, a Battleground volunteer, is among those who will have to get re-certified—the third time she’ll have had to go through the process since the fall of 2012, even though the rules haven’t changed since then.

“It seems to be that the purpose is to make it more difficult to register voters,” Mason said.

And because the rules especially target organized voter registration drives of the kind conducted by Battleground Texas, they disproportionately affect blacks and Latinos. Experts say minorities are more likely than whites to register through registration drives.

Just 28.3% of eligible Texans voted in the November midterms, according to estimates by the respected political scientist Michael McDonald – the second lowest rate in the country. Over 2 million eligible Texas Hispanics were not registered to vote, according to a 2012 report."

417|What Saudi Succession Would Mean For Oil|"Saudi Arabia's 91-year-old king, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, is in the hospital for ""medical checks"" in Riyadh, according to Al Jazeera America.

This isn't super surprising. King Abdullah's health has been deteriorating for quite a while, and his half brother Salman, who is 79 and next in line to the throne, has been representing him at events recently.

But the Saudi succession question brings up real questions about the country's oil policy.

It has, so far, refused to cut oil production to stop prices from falling further, preferring to let the market run its course. But that could change at any time, and may very well if there is a transition period related to succession soon.

Emad Mostaque at the emerging markets consultancy Ecstrat outlines the basic issue:

Oil prices are now at levels that cause real concern on the streets of Saudi Arabia, with the prospect of succession the icing on top that has caused retail investors to take the market down another leg.

This policy may not make it through a succession period, where public support and good will is essential, particularly as it has nearly been 20 years since the last change.

The new regent could decide to keep existing policy, change it completely or anything he decides. Similarly he has free reign to realign Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy as he wishes, which is a discussion for another time and place, but could have significant regional impacts.

So the health of King Abdullah is definitely something to watch going forward."

419|Mother of Missing Maryland Toddler Ordered Held on Bond; Recovery Efforts to Begin|"A Maryland woman who told police she abandoned her 14-month-old son on the front porch of a stranger's home in central Ohio was ordered held on $150,000 bond on Wednesday in her first court appearance.

Authorities said the little boy, Cameron Beckford, is presumed dead. The woman's attorney said she made up the porch story.

Dainesha Stevens is charged with endangering children and tampering with evidence and was held on $75,000 bond on each count. Franklin County Municipal Court Judge Michael Brandt also ordered her not to have any contact with children.

Stevens, 24, is charged with letting someone harm the child by severely disciplining him without trying to stop the person, according to charging information read in court Wednesday. The assault happened between Dec. 21 and Dec. 23, according to the charges.

Stevens' attorney said his client is cooperating with police in their search for the toddler.

Stevens made up the story about leaving the boy on the porch and says that was her way of asking for help, Collins said.

""There's reasons why she said what she said, but she's trying to do the right thing and that's what she did by helping yesterday and today,"" Collins said Wednesday after the brief court hearing.

According to The Columbus Dispatch, Stevens brought Cameron and his 6-year-old sister to Columbus from Frederick, Maryland on Dec. 15.

Collins said that before leaving Maryland, Stevens called police for help, and received a bus pass from the local protective services agency.

Frederick, Maryland police spokesman Lt. Clark Pennington said a domestic dispute preceded Stevens' departure.

""I know that they had, like, an argument on the 14th and that's why we think she went to Ohio on the 15th,"" he said. Pennington said he didn't have immediate access to details about the dispute.

Frederick police previously said the father of the two children called police Sunday and reported that their mother had taken them to an unknown location in Columbus in mid-December. Based on the father's concerns, missing-child reports were issued.

Collins said he didn't know the details of what happened in Maryland.

Stevens was staying with a male friend she knew as a teenager in Maryland, Collins said. That man is being held on misdemeanor warrants unrelated to the toddler's disappearance.

""It's our goal to keep that man in custody pending further investigation by the police,"" said Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien.

Columbus officers searched Tuesday near a creek with a dive team and helicopter after Stevens admitted she and a male acquaintance left Cameron on Friday night because they could no longer care for him. The area being searched on the city's far east side is more than two miles from the home where Stevens said she left the child.

Stevens pointed police to the creek, Collins confirmed Wednesday without providing details.

The search is now considered a recovery effort because of information obtained by investigators, said Sgt. Rich Weiner, a Columbus police spokesman.

Cameron's 6-year-old sister, Cheyenne, was turned over to Franklin County Children Services.

Police said Stevens had legal custody of both children.

A missing-child alert said the toddler was wearing a puffy black coat, gray pants, black and red boots and a gray elephant hat. Police say he has brown eyes and a Mohawk hairstyle.

A woman who answered the phone at a house believed to be the father's residence said he wasn't home. She said Beckford was her son. She apologetically declined to answer more questions and would not give her name. She also refused to open the door to the apartment, located in a densely populated neighborhood in the city, about 40 miles west of Baltimore.

What would your view be on this space? It is not essentially a pocket that has done extremely well?

UR Bhat: Because the problems that were there in power industry are on the verge of getting solved hopefully in the next a few weeks.

ET Now: Is it getting solved?

UR Bhat: Looks like that. There are two issues. One is about coal allocation. The second is about receivables. That problem is still not solved. Electricity boards and companies that have been restructured still owe a lot of money to these companies and suppliers. It need to be solved. Unless that is solved, some financial package to the electricity boards should be in offing. I do not think they have ever suffered from want of orders. It is only problem of execution and collecting the receivables. If the cycle gets restarted again, there is lot of hope for these companies."
422|ISIL releases interview with captured Jordan pilot|"The hardline ISIL group has released what it said was an interview with a Jordanian pilot captured last week after his plane crashed during US-led coalition bombing in eastern Syria.

It was not possible to independently verify the interview published in the group's English-language online magazine Dabiq in which First Lieutenant Muath Al Kasaesbeh was quoted as saying his F-16 fighter was ""struck by a heat seeking missile"".

""I heard and felt its hit. The other Jordanian pilot in the mission contacted me from a participating jet and told me that I was struck and that fire was coming out of the rear nozzle of my engine,"" Kasaesbeh said.

He made brief comments about life at his base, sharing meals with hundreds of US personnel.

""The Americans sometimes have dinner with us and eat mansaf (a traditional Arab dish) which they like alot. Their talk does not include details about operations because of matters of secrecy and security.""

Jordan declined comment on the interview, the first since ISIL published photographs purporting to show his capture.

Kasaesbeh, who comes from a prominent Jordanian family, is the first pilot from the coalition known to have been captured by ISIL.

Kasaesbeh's jet crashed last week in a rural area in Syria's Raqqa province, the group's stronghold. Jordan's government at first said the crash could have been the result of a missile attack but later it said there was no proof.

Jordan is one of several Arab countries taking part in a US-led coalition to strike the hardline group which announced an Islamic caliphate in large parts of Syria and Iraq where it has imposed its radical interpretation of Islam.

Kasaesbeh's capture shocked the country. Several politicians and lawmakers called on the government to pull out of the coalition. The authorities said his capture would not weaken its resolve to fight militant Islamist groups."

429|Post WWII Gene Variant Increases Obesity Risk|"If you were born after 1942, you are more vulnerable to a gene variant that is linked to obesity. This is what a new study from Harvard Medical School seems to suggest.

“What we wanted to see was whether there was a difference for people in the earlier part of the cohort, during the 1920s (when compared) to people born in the later part if the cohort, in the 1940s and 1950s,” explains lead author Dr. James Niels Rosenquist. He is a psychiatrist with Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston as well as an instructor with Harvard Medical School.

He goes on to say, “…we found that the correlation between the best known obesity-associated gene variant and body mass index increased significantly as the year of birth of participants increased. These results—to our knowledge the first of their kind—suggest that this and perhaps other correlations between gene variants and physical traits may very significantly depending on when individuals were born, even for those born into the same families.”



Rosenquist says that the researchers could not find any specific differences between these generations, but he argues that the increasingly sedentary lifestyle of Americans combined with high-calorie, low-nutrient foods might contribute.

Rosenquist concludes, “We know that environment plays a huge role in the expression of genes, and the fact that our effect can be seen even among siblings born during different years implies that global environmental factors such as trends in food products and workplace activity, not just those found within families, may impact genetic traits. Our results underscore the importance of interpreting any genetic studies with a grain of salt and leave open the possibility that new genetic risk factors may be seen in the future due to different genetically driven responses to our ever-changing environment.”"
430|Syriza surges ahead of January election as Greek voters reject austerity|"The snap election called in Greece for January 25 has renewed speculation about the country’s uncertain future as left-of-centre Syriza looks likely to capitalise on the unprecedented unpopularity of the ruling coalition of conservative New Democracy and socialists PASOK to snatch power – perhaps with an absolute majority.

Syriza, which has come from virtually nowhere (3% in the polls in 2009 to 28% at the end of 2014) has little experience in national politics and its commitment to renegotiating the terms of Greece’s bailout could represent a serious concern for the country’s creditors. The impact this could have for the Eurozone is even more worrying – the potential knock-on effects of an unprecedented exit from the Euro for the global financial system should the Greek government decide, or be forced, to abandon the common currency, are difficult to predict.

Domestically, the immediate consequences of a disorderly departure for Greece’s economy and its people are all-too predictable: a run on the banks and ensuing social disorder are the first to spring to mind. Greece’s overall unemployment rate has topped 20% for four consecutive years now (and reached almost 27% in 2013) with youth unemployment above 50%, many people in Greece have reached breaking point. Emigration among educated young people is at record high levels.

The human cost of austerity policies has been immense. According to UNICEF, childhood poverty increased by 20% between 2008 and 2012 as well as a four-fold increase in the number of families with two or more unemployed members during the same period – it is not uncommon to see people searching for food in garbage cans in Athens. But with the level of debt reaching 175% of Greek GDP in 2013 from 120% in 2010 when Greece entered the bailout, it is virtually impossible for an incoming government to either reduce the deficit or to tackle poverty.

Greece’s total debt, which presently stands at €360 billion, is not only unsustainable but also politically unacceptable – and a substantial debt reduction, though unpopular with many European parliaments, is the only possible and right decision that the European Union must seriously consider.

The EU governments’ decision to rescue their private lenders from their bad investments by underwriting banks’ debts and squeezing their own citizens to pay these back has led to an impasse. Bondholders and lenders need to realise that maintaining the existing course of action in Greece and elsewhere could result in the loss of all of their money. Meanwhile apportioning blame and punishing the Greek population collectively for the parlous state of the national economy has bred resentment rather than bringing the country nearer to any productive solutions.

Voters reject austerity

It may be a fact that many ordinary Greeks do all they can to evade taxes – and the lack of outrage at some of the more nefarious practises of successive governments has enabled widespread corruption, but the fact remains that more austerity will not get the country out of an impossibly bad situation. And here is the problem – the coalition of socialist and conservative governments have asked Greek people to do just that: they have called on ordinary people to make continuous “sacrifices” by accepting ever greater cuts in salaries and pensions to pay down the debt.

The Greek population’s anger at this state of affairs has until now been successfully diverted towards lenders and the troika (IMF, EU, ECB) who are being held responsible for Greece’s woes.

EPA/Alexandros Vlachos

So it should come as no surprise that voters are turning to Syriza which promises to restore the minimum wage and create a safety net for those who are hardest hit by the crisis – offer free access to health care for those who need it and electricity to those whose supply has been cut since they could not pay their income tax (which is attached to the electricity bill).

Whether Syriza is able to deliver on these promises remains to be seen. But the EU has little to lose and much to gain from supporting a democratically elected government of Greece, especially if it has a mandate to address the social costs of European integration. After all, the European Union was never meant as an economic, custom or monetary union only. Right from the outset, it had a social dimension.

The cost of neglecting this dimension through austerity policies and the democratic deficit in the EU, has led to the rise of the far right in Europe. Without seeing a better future for themselves and without having a say over the direction of the European project, citizens in many countries will continue to discuss rejecting union. The possibility of an anti-austerity government being elected in Greece might open up a space for re-imagining the European project"

""The state government should issue a white paper on the state's financial position and take corrective measures against 'rampant' corruption in the state,"" state president Tai Tagak said during a press onference here.



He alleged that the ruling Congress government in the state had siphoned off a huge chunk of central funds during the last fiscal without submission of utilization certificates (UCs) to the Centre.



""Because of non-submission of UCs against various central funds, the Centre is not in a position to release funds to the state,"" Tagak said.



""Unless the state government comes clean on judicious utilization of funds, how can it plead for fresh funds,"" Tagak said.



He described the present financial crisis the state is facing 'unfortunate'.



He said the state government should not try to divert people's attention by leveling false allegations on the opposition in the state.



""We are ready to help the government if it desires. It should convene an all-party meeting to discuss the present financial scenario and should come with clear-cut policies and programmes to prove its avowed people-centric claim,"" Tagak said, adding, submission of genuine UCs matters most.



Giving a chronology of funds sanctioned to the state, Tagak claimed that the Centre had sanctioned Rs 56.2 crore in 2011-12 under National Health Mission (NHM), Rs 74.01 crore (2012-13), Rs 86.31 crore (2013-14) and Rs 181 crore during the current fiscal.



However, the state government failed to submit UCs to match sanction and claim next installment.



""This cannot be construed as halt of fund flow as this is the procedure for the funds to flow for proper utilization,"" reasoned Tagak.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Turning up the pressure on Israel, the Palestinians announced Wednesday that they are joining the International Criminal Court to pursue war-crimes charges against the Jewish state — a risky, high-stakes move that brought threats of retaliation from Israel and criticism from the U.S.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas acted a day after suffering a defeat in the U.N. Security Council, which voted down a resolution setting a three-year deadline for the establishment of a Palestinian state on lands occupied by Israel.

""We want to complain. There's aggression against us, against our land. The Security Council disappointed us,"" Abbas said.

Turning to the international court at The Hague marks a major policy shift, transforming Abbas' relations with Israel from tense to openly hostile. The ultimate goal is to pressure Israel into withdrawing from the territories and agreeing to Palestinian statehood.

The strategy carries risks, including the possibility the Palestinians themselves could be accused of war crimes over rocket attacks by the extremist group Hamas on Israeli population centers and other violence against Jewish targets.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to take unspecified ""retaliatory steps."" In Washington, State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said the U.S. was ""deeply troubled"" by the Palestinians' ""escalatory step."" He said it was ""entirely counterproductive and does nothing to further the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a sovereign and independent state.""

At the international court, the Palestinians could seek to have Israeli military or political figures prosecuted for alleged crimes involving settlement construction on occupied lands or actions by the military that cause heavy civilian casualties, for instance.

Israel is not a member of the court and does not recognize its jurisdiction. And the court has no police force and no authority to go into Israel and arrest suspects. But it could issue arrest warrants that would make it difficult for Israeli officials to travel abroad.

Abbas has been under heavy pressure to take stronger action against Israel amid months of rising tensions over the collapse of U.S.-brokered peace talks last spring, a 50-day war between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza over the summer, a recent spate of deadly Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets, and Israeli restrictions on access to a key Muslim holy site in Jerusalem.

The Palestinians planned to submit the paperwork for joining the ICC to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday afternoon, but postponed it, probably until Friday. Handing over the documents is the last formal step for Palestine to become a member of the ICC, which would happen in about 60 days.

Israel could take a number of retaliatory actions, including building more settlements, restricting financial transfers to the Palestinians, or curbing certain privileges. The U.S. has not said how it will react, but it provides hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians.

In a statement, Netanyahu said Israel will protect its troops from prosecution, calling the country's army ""the most moral"" in the world. He warned that Abbas' Palestinian Authority is ""the one who needs to fear the International Criminal Court.""

The court would be able to prosecute only crimes committed from here on in, not past offenses, said Robbie Sabel, an international law expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Sabel agreed the Palestinians themselves could be at risk of prosecution.

""On the other side of the coin — and this is why the Palestinians have hesitated up until now — is that any Palestinian who commits a war crime anywhere in the world and has not been tried by a Palestinian court could also be subject to the jurisdiction of the court,"" he said. ""So it works both ways.""

The Palestinian U.N. ambassador, Riyad Mansour, has said repeatedly that the Palestinians are not afraid of that possibility.

Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch, called the Palestinian move to join the court ""an overdue but welcome step toward impartial justice for serious crimes by Israelis and Palestinians alike. This move by Ramallah sends a strong message that the days of near total impunity that have characterized this conflict could be ending.""

The Palestinians seek the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem — areas captured by Israel in 1967. Netanyahu, who is seeking re-election in March, has said Palestinian independence can be achieved only through negotiations.

Turning to the court became an option for Abbas in 2012 after the United Nations recognized ""Palestine"" as a non-member observer state.

Abbas made his announcement as the long-dominant Fatah party marked its 50th anniversary.

Yasser Arafat founded Fatah in 1965 with the goal of destroying Israel. The party rose to prominence in the 1970s and '80s with a series of hijackings and other attacks. Over time, Fatah moderated and accepted Israel's right to exist, while seeking a Palestinian state. Arafat died in 2004.

Hills, cold take toll, stranding huge piece of equipment in Duluth

DULUTH, Minn. - After spending a day blocking traffic on a Duluth street — looking somewhat like a spaceship that had landed amid the houses and trees of Goat Hill — a massive, 187-ton piece of oil refinery equipment finally started moving again on Wednesday. But it didn’t travel far.

Advertisement

The semi towing the large metal cylinder from the Duluth harbor to Provo, Utah, slowly climbed uphill and pulled to a stop out of traffic near the intersection of 24th Avenue West and Piedmont Avenue, just above Skyline Parkway, where it’s slated to stay until it continues on its way Friday.

The rig — including a specialized platform trailer, with tires protruding like centipede legs — stalled Tuesday morning when it became stuck on a patch of ice on old Piedmont Avenue, and then suffered several mechanical failures. It didn’t move again until after 1 p.m. Wednesday.

“It’s these hills of Duluth; they take their toll,” said Lt. Darren Juntunen with the Minnesota State Patrol, which is escorting the cargo across the state.

A spokesman with Emmert International, which is providing the transportation, explained how an already complicated delivery grew even more so with a mix of frigid temperatures, a broken driveshaft and seizing brakes.

“We were kind of scratching our heads about why would it lock up, but it was just right at its operational limit with the temperatures,” said Mark Albrecht, director of operations based out of Emmert’s headquarters in Clackamas, Ore.

The broken driveshaft was the result of getting stuck and was simple enough to fix, he said. It was the many axles on the trailer that confounded the crew of about eight men and left them scrambling to get the load moving again. The trailer is modular with several pieces connecting to make up the full trailer, making for many axles and braking systems.

The difficulty came in getting the brakes thawed and operating. Albrecht speculated that condensation got into valves during outside storage and prevented alcohol in canisters from running through the braking systems of the modules, causing the brakes to seize.

“They’d frozen multiple axles and wheels,” Juntunen said. “By the time they’d heat one thing up, they were back to the same problem somewhere else.”

Albrecht said the massive piece of equipment being transported is a new style of oil refinery regenerator. It works alongside a reactor to refine crude oil into gasoline and other petroleum products; this particular regenerator will be used to make a kind of “extremely slippery” oil, he said.

The regenerator had been sitting in Duluth since earlier this month. It was brought by barge into the Duluth Seaway Port Authority’s Clure Public Marine Terminal on Dec. 11, said Adele Yorde with the Port Authority.

The regenerator sat until transportation began Tuesday. That three weeks of outside storage is what may have caused the condensation, Albrecht said.

The regenerator is too tall to travel on Interstate 35, so the goal was to get it from the Clure terminal to the truck scale near the intersection of U.S. Highway 2 and Minnesota Highway 33, before carrying on westward.

The load has a maximum transport speed of 13 mph.

“The plan,” Albrecht said, “is to slowly go up the road.”"
435|Deadly HCM City blaze kills 1, destroys 3 houses|"Cambodian authorities on Wednesday refused a request for asylum made by nine Vietnamese Montagnards who had traveled to Phnom Penh to ask for help, and whose presence in the country had previously gone unreported.

The nine arrived in the capital on Sept. 30, but were turned away by the Ministry of Interior, which refused to register their names, a U.N. rights officer posted to Cambodia told RFA's Khmer Service on Thursday.

""OHCHR was alerted to the arrival of nine new asylum seekers yesterday requesting assistance,"" Wan-Hea Lee, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) representative in Cambodia wrote in an e-mail.

""I understand that they were also refused registration by the Refugee Department, as have all others who crossed over this year,"" she wrote.

The group, which had traveled to the capital from northeastern Cambodia's Ratanakiri province, had earlier told local contacts they feared being returned to Vietnam, where they said they face political persecution, one Ratanakiri villager said.

""The Vietnamese authorities are cracking down just now,"" the villager said, adding that another Montagnard, traveling alone, had entered Ratanakiri on Sept. 28.

""They are being persecuted. The Vietnamese authorities want to arrest some of them, and some of the others were just recently released.""

Chhay Thi, Ratanakiri provincial coordinator for the rights group Adhoc, confirmed that the group had been present in the area for at least a week and said he had told U.N. representatives of their request for help.

Disputed status

Cambodian authorities maintain that the nearly 200 ethnic Montagnards who have crossed into Cambodia from Vietnam's Central Highlands since late last year are not political refugees, but farmers who have entered the country for economic reasons.

In mid-July, a dozen Montagnards who had sought refugee status in Cambodia willingly returned to Vietnam after Hanoi gave assurances it would not punish or discriminate against them. It is not known what happened to them after their return.

While turning away the Montagnards, a senior Ministry of Interior official told RFA on Thursday that Cambodia will accept as refugees two Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar currently detained by Australia on the small Pacific island of Nauru.

""We have seen their documents,"" Kem Sarin, head of Cambodia's Immigration Department, said, adding that immigration officials will travel to Nauru to interview the two asylum-seekers before they come to Cambodia.

""They have volunteered to settle in Cambodia, and after we speak to them we will return here to request permission from the government to accept them,"" he said.

In April, Cambodia granted asylum to an Iranian couple, an Iranian man, and a Rohingya Muslim from Myanmar who had sought asylum in Australia but were denied entry, being held instead for months in a camp in Nauru for refugees unwelcome in the country.

In exchange, Australia promised to pay more than U.S. $40 million in costs and aid to Cambodia, drawing criticism from rights groups who noted that Cambodia had forced asylum-seekers from China and Vietnam back home.

The Rohingya man later asked to be returned to Myanmar.

436|32 websites go blank|"Show-cause notices were issued to these websites under question, and only five or six had replied.

Instructions issued by the Department of Telecommunications to Internet service providers in the country directing them to block 32 websites on data archiving, video sharing and software development have evoked criticism on the social media.

The DoT invoked Section 69A (power of blocking public access to Internet contents) of the Information Technology Act and the Information Technology (Procedures and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules to issue the directive on December 16.

“All Internet Service Licences are accordingly directed to immediately block access to above URLs,” said the order, listing the web addresses including that of portals like archive.org and vimeo.com that were later unblocked.

A government source said the decision was taken after thorough “filtration process based on a strict regimen,” and there is a committee in the Department of Information Technology to vet complaints.

Linked to IS case

The blocking of websites, government sources said, was linked to the Islamic State (IS) recruitment issue. There have been “instances” of recruitment of youth from Maharashtra to the IS in Iraq. The ban came on the basis of a request by the State Anti-Terrorism Squad.

The sources said show-cause notices were issued to these websites under question, and only five or six had replied.

One of the websites, pastebin.com tweeted on December 26 that its URL had been blocked by the Indian government.

“Pastebin is still blocked in India. We are getting many reports about this. The Indian government has blocked us, and right now there is little we can do about it. It has happened in the past, and we got unblocked after some time. For now we recommend using a free proxy service if you are based in India,” said its Facebook post the same day.

A senior Telecom Ministry official said: “Several web addresses have since been unblocked after verification.” By Wednesday, a dozen websites were unblocked.

Stating that web contents are often blocked for objectionable/communally inflammatory contents, a Home Ministry official said: “They are blocked either on court orders or on the direct request of security agencies, which also approach the agencies concerned for the same through the Home Ministry. In the recent past, websites posting IS propaganda material have been a cause of concern for us. The archiving sites, which are used to migrate and store such objectionable data, have also to be examined,” he said.

Internet Archive on Wednesday tweeted: “We’ve received many complaints from people in India who can’t access http://archive.org.”

Shocked over the government directive, many in the social media criticised the action. “Some flop movie must have asked Court for a John Doe to prevent piracy of the flop movie,” said one in Twitter, while another said: “more like shutting the freeway because someone doesn’t like the color of a car.”"

For years, a man carried hatred for the police officer who arrested him for drunk driving. He believed drinking and driving should be allowed and felt unfairly punished. But later, the man met that officer again and needed to tell him about his change of heart.

He had found the loss of his license to be the action needed to convince him to lay off alcohol for his fun. His outlook on life was no longer filtered through anger. His hatred had been replaced by appreciation. The cop was thanked.

Our worldview becomes a filter for our perception. Some information gets into our minds through the filter and some doesn't.

The world has a spectrum of facts, events, opinions, experiences, religions, ethnicities, etc., but only some make it in. Like a spectrum of colors, our filter lets in some lights, but not others.

The political, cultural and theological world is purple, but some of us only get the reds and some of us only get the blues. A healthy country has the interaction of conservatives and liberals, but some of us only can receive information that supports one side or the other.

A healthy culture has the interaction of tradition and innovation, safety and risk, the tried and true vs. the possibility of the better. Some of us have only a strong attraction to one and aversion to the other.

The Bible tells us Jesus is both human and divine. Some of us pay attention to one aspect and ignore the other. Why? Because of the filter to our perceptions.

Camera lenses, water treatment plants and auto motors have filters.

The mind's filter is our biases. We all have them. Even those of us who work at neutrality, even ""fair and balanced"" news networks, have biases. Networks have to choose which facts they'll present. Our minds choose which facts are important to know. Biases preserve us from the chaos of information overload so we can function. We can't pay attention to every stimulus.

Occasionally, we need to examine our filter. Just as the body needs an occasional exam, so too does our mind. The examined life requires occasional updates to our worldview. Does it adequately make sense of what's happening?

The examined life requires occasional updates to our filter. Is it still helpful? Does it order our lives so we can still love those who are different, or does it screen them out and isolate us from the action?

Daylight saving time changeover is a good time to check the batteries in our smoke detectors. Five thousand miles is a good time to change the oil filter. New Year's Day is a good time to refresh and re-examine our worldview filter.

Check to see if we can still accurately understand the position of our opponents. Ask someone who disagrees why they think as they do. Read about why some in the world don't like America or our church or our party or the Green Bay Packers. Remind yourself where you got your worldview and see if the lessons learned from your experiences still apply.

Life-changing events are times we re-evaluate what we knew to be true. The loss of a loved one or job, adolescence, a brush with death or religious conversion are example of times when our filters get replaced. We don't need to wait. It's a new year. Now is a good time for an attitude checkup.

This year saw changes in marriage law and killings of black males and police by each other and torture by Islamic radicals and the CIA and so many challenges to our filters. We saw the increase in interpreting facts to fit beliefs. We had to work harder to justify our points of view. Filtering got more fierce. Will next year be any easier on our preconceptions?

The world is changing. Are you keeping up? Only those who can re-examine their worldview, beliefs and biases can enjoy the world as it is, rather than burning valuable energy fussing that it's leaving us behind.

It's a new year — a good opportunity for a filter upgrade.

440|CANADA STOCKS-TSX slips, but set to finish up for the year|"TORONTO Dec 31 Canada's main stock index fell on Wednesday but was on track to finish in positive territory for a third consecutive year despite blows dealt by oil, which is heading for its biggest annual decline since 2008.

The resource-heavy index, which is more than 1,000 points off record highs reached in September, was pulled down by energy stocks on Wednesday, as well as financial and materials shares, though U.S. equities edged higher in early trading.

Oil dropped as a survey showed China's factory sector shrank for the first time in seven months in December, a bearish indicator for an oil market already under pressure from weakening demand and a supply glut.

""It looks like a U.S. up day, Canadian down day, just because of oil,"" said Keith Richards, portfolio manager and technical analyst at ValueTrend Wealth Management.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 61.5 points, or 0.42 percent, at 14,578.50.

Energy stocks fell 1.2 percent, led by heavyweight Suncor Energy Inc, which was down 1.6 percent at C$36.51.

Richards sees the oil downturn as cyclical, and expects further declines in the medium term, as well as lower copper prices.

""We could se a bounce on oil, it could go from the fifties back to $60 or something in the short term, but generally speaking I think oil is heading down to the forties again,"" he said. ""I can't be bullish on commodities.""

Copper fell on Wednesday, and ended the year down 14 percent, its biggest annual decline in three years, on fears that a supply surplus would hit the market next year.

Spot gold also fell, and materials sector dropped 1.2 percent. Barrick Gold Corp was a drag on the index, falling 2.5 percent to C$12.29.

The index was on track to finish up about 7 percent from the end of 2013, when it rose nearly 10 percent. (Editing by Grant McCool)"

442|Report questions investigation that cleared Norm Coleman benefactor|"There’s no better example of the appearance of questionable ethics in politics than the once-brewing 2008 scandal in which a civil lawsuit claimed a Minnesota businessman tried to arrange a bribe to then-Sen. Norm Coleman by funeling money to a business employing Coleman’s wife.

Paul McKim, founder and former CEO of Houston-based Deep Marine Technology, claimed that Kazeminy pressured his company to make payments to Hays Companies – the employer of Laurie Coleman, who is a licensed insurance broker. Kazeminy and his companies are the single largest shareholder in Deep Marine Technology, the suit says. McKim claims that Kazeminy told the company’s chief financial officer that “U.S. senators don’t make (expletive deleted),” and that he was going to use Deep Marine Technology to get money to Coleman. McKim said that when he objected, Kazeminy threatened to fire him, saying “this is my company,” and forced him to approve the first payment of $25,000 to Hays Companies.

Coleman lost the election to Al Franken in a famous recount and a few months later — April 2009 — Deep Marine’s litigation committee said its eight-month investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.

“This was nothing short of an effort to extort or blackmail people with lies,” said Kazeminy’s attorney at the time.

Kazeminy hired former FBI director Louis Freeh to conduct his own investigation into the allegations.

“And we concluded after that investigation, that the allegations — particularly the allegation of the $100,000 payment — was baseless and false,” he said.

Freeh also declined to make the investigation public.

The Star Tribune reported at the time..

In his review of a previous investigation, Freeh said he was able to confirm that Kazeminy had given Coleman gifts over the years that totaled more than $100,000 in value. Those included at least two suits from Nieman Marcus in Minneapolis and flights to Florida on Kazeminy’s private jets. The gifts stretched back to the former senator’s terms as St. Paul mayor. Ron Rosenbaum, a Minneapolis attorney serving as a spokesman for Kazeminy, said Freeh didn’t merely rely on Kazeminy’s version of events, but reviewed the previous investigation of the allegations, along with numerous documents. “He went over everything,” Rosenbaum said. “In criminal defense work, you don’t rely on your client’s word. Kazeminy wanted this investigated from top to bottom because he wanted a clean bill of health.

Case closed?

In an article today on how public officials have gotten rich since their public-service days, The Intercept notes that Freeh, who made a little over $100,000 as head of the FBI, now makes money doing investigations on his own. He and his wife now own four estates, a summerhouse worth $3 million in Vermont, a beachfront penthouse in Palm Beach worth another $3 million.

The deed shows that Freeh’s wife owns half of the penthouse. Kazeminy owns the other half.

“The quit claim deed giving Freeh’s wife one-half ownership of the penthouse was signed nine days after Freeh’s vindication of Kazeminy,” The Intercept says.

The Justice Department declined to prosecute, didn’t say it was even conducting an investigation, and, obviously, didn’t indicate how much it relied on the Freeh investigation — if at all — in making its decision."

It is one of the country's 33 provinces with the provincial capital at Denpasar towards the south of the island. The province covers a few small neighbouring islands as well as the isle of Bali.

With a population recorded as 3,891,428 in the 2010 census, the island is home to most of Indonesia's Hindu minority. In the 2000 census about 92.29% of Bali's population adhered to Balinese Hinduism while most of the remainder follow Islam. It is also the largest tourist destination in the country and is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. Bali, a tourist haven for decades, has seen a further surge in tourist numbers in recent years.

Bali was inhabited by around 2000 BC by Austronesian peoples who migrated originally from Taiwan through Maritime Southeast Asia. Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are thus closely related to the peoples of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Oceania. Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west."

Fox News host Megyn Kelly on July 1, 2014. [Fox News]

Fox News, currently locked in both a negotiation battle and social media war with the Dish Network, has been taking a beating in the ratings since the Dish blackout began, according to the International Business Times.

For the week ending Dec. 28, Fox News averaged 939,000 prime-time viewers, down from 1.65 million viewers the previous week and 1.68 million the week before that, according to Nielsen Media.

Although television viewership traditionally drops during Christmas/New Year holiday week, Fox’s collapse is almost 12 percent lower when compared to the same week last year. The drop is understandable as Dish Network’s 13 million subscribers represent approximately 13.4 percent of the pay-TV market.

Dish Television dropped both Fox News and the Fox Business Network on Dec. 21, citing an impasse in negotiations with the Fox, claiming the network is leveraging its most popular programming in order to extort higher fees for less desirable channels.

In a public relations battle with Dish, Fox set up a Facebook page allowing their loyal viewers to vent at the satellite provider, while encouraging them to drop their Dish subscriptions.

Dish Network CEO Charlie Ergen recently issued a video response to Fox, decrying their tactics and calling it “extortion.”

“Ironically, Fox News would be the first network to decry this kind of deal-making,” Ergen said. “There’s nothing about this extortion attempt that was fair or balanced.”

Despite the ratings drop, Fox News still beats competitors CNN and MSNBC with almost twice the total prime-time viewership."
454|UPDATE 1-Floods cut Malaysia's rubber, palm oil output - minister|"(Adds details)

KUALA LUMPUR Dec 31 (Reuters) - Flooding across parts of major rubber and palm oil producer Malaysia due to monsoon rains has cut production in December, a senior government official said, squeezing supply and lifting prices.

Heavy downpours and floods this month have destroyed acres of plantation and forced a quarter of a million people to be evacuated from their homes, local authorities say.

Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Douglas Uggah Embas expects rubber supply to ""reduce drastically"" in early 2015 due to the floods.

""For our country we are expecting it will reduce around 30,000 tonnes (in December)...the reason is because of the rain, so there's no tapping,"" Douglas told reporters in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday.

Palm oil output may decline by about 15-30 percent in December against the usual drop of 10 percent during the rainy season, he said.

Heavy rains prevent plantation workers from harvesting palm fruit, resulting in rot. Fruit that is harvested, however, may not get crushed into crude palm oil as mills are shut due to flooding or as roads out of the estates are cut off.

Some planters and traders expect the wet weather to curb December output by 20 percent or more as thunderstorms and floods disrupt harvesting and force mills to shut."
455|Ventura College applies to offer four-year degree|"VENTURA, Calif. - Ventura College has officially applied to be one of 15 community colleges statewide offering four-year degrees.

If the college is accepted to the pilot program in January, it will offer a four-year degree in technical supervision and management. The program would allow students in fields such as automotive technology or culinary sciences to learn management skills, growing in their careers, said college President Greg Gillespie.

“The degree will help those in technical fields obtain the skills they need to open their own business or move into management or supervision,” Gillespie said. “We chose it because it’s broad-based, rather than focusing on a narrow discipline.”

Under a recent state law, some California community colleges will be able to offer four-year degrees in fields not covered by nearby California State University or University of California campuses. Students would pay $84 per unit for upper-division courses — more than the $46 per unit they pay for lower-division courses but less than the tuition in the CSU and UC systems.

A total of 34 community colleges or districts applied for the pilot program by the Dec. 19 deadline, said Paul Feist, the community college system’s vice chancellor for communications.

“We knew there would be a lot of interest,” Feist said. “That’s about half the districts in the system. ... And it’s a broad range of areas.”

Proposals include degrees in health information management, mortuary science and applied technology in viticulture.

The chancellor’s office plans to announce Jan. 20 which 15 colleges have been selected for the program.

If Ventura College is chosen, the program would start in fall 2016 with about 70 students, Gillespie said. In its application to the state, the college predicts the program would grow to 442 students in its fourth year.

The program would be organized to accommodate working students, so classes would be offered primarily in the evenings and on weekends. The courses would be a mix of online and in-class instruction to give students more flexibility.

Proposed course focuses include workplace ethics and law, quality-control systems and financial management.

The program would be developed by a team of faculty members representing technical disciplines at the college, as well as representatives from sister schools Moorpark College and Oxnard College, Gillespie said.

Community colleges in 21 other states already offer four-year degrees, and management has proved popular, Gillespie said.

Miami Dade College in Florida, for example, awarded 428 degrees in supervision and management this year — 41 percent of all the school’s bachelor of applied science degrees.

457|Top 10 Environmental Stories: Local environmental news wasn't all bad this year|"Photo by John Anderson

1) SUNNIER DAYS This was the Year of the Sun, with solar contract prices dropping to record lows and advocates and City Council pressing Austin Energy forward on a more aggressive strategy for renewables and zero-emissions strategies. The matter is hardly settled – and the new Council will have its own input – but real progress is undeniable.

2) CLIMATE TARGET In April, Council revised its Climate Protection Plan to make it ""the most aggressive city plan"" to date, with various targets for city emission reductions as well as public goals, with the ultimate target of ""carbon neutrality"" by 2050, and to build in ""climate resiliency.""

3) FLOOD CONTROL The consequences of intense growth as well as climate inaction came home in 2013 in the Halloween flood, leaving many homeowners devastated and city officials embarrassed at inadequate response. The city issued an ""After Action Report"" to address its shortfalls, with 171 items to be addressed, most urgently a homeowner buyout and a better early-warning system for floodplain residents.

4) ENDLESS HIGHWAY The long-planned and long-controversial State Highway 45 Southwest was back on the agenda, with political changes at Commissioners Court reactivating the project, and Council and environmental advocates looking for new ways to delay or prevent it. Environmental reviews still hang in the balance, but the momentum favors the bulldozers.

5) WATER PLANTED With a bit of fanfare, the city officially opened the still-contentious Water Treatment Plant No. 4 in December, noting its improvement of north and northwest water supplies and energy-efficient design and location. But it was also the focus of 10-1 campaign backlash as unnecessary, and its debt load has added to rising water costs despite increasing conservation.

6) WATER RISING Both city-owned utilities are caught in the conservation-pricing dilemma, and a city task force tried to design solutions for Austin Water – to moderate price increases while selling less water. Council's FY 2015 budget trimmed the increases, but a long-term solution remains elusive.

7) WAITING FOR RAIN The overarching environmental story of the last several years has been the statewide drought, either the very worst or second-worst in Texas history, and increasingly appearing to be the new normal. Coupled with Central Texas growth, the drought has preoccupied state and local officials, searching for conservation, water resources, and adaptations.

8) SEALANTS SEALED There's been some good 2014 enviro news as well: Austin's initial ban on coal-tar asphalt sealants has proved beneficial to local lakes and waterways, and has begun a trend nationally to move away from the toxic products. The sealants proved to be the source of sediment pollution in Barton Springs Pool, and Council's 2005 ban has resulted in mitigation.

9) GREEN STUDENTS A 2014 highlight was the expansion of Green Is the New Black, a Huston-Tillotson student group working on basic education, sustainability, and environmental initiatives in the context of low-income communities and minority outreach. Inspired by environmental science professor Jeff Wilson's Dumpster Project, the students are making their own initiatives and building a culture of sustainability.

10) EXPLOSIVE POLITICS Close to home, we can't forget Governor-elect Greg Abbott's campaign advice to Texans who are concerned that there might be toxic or explosive chemicals stored nearby – as the residents of West learned disastrously in the 2013 fertilizer plant explosion that killed 15 people and injured many more. Rather than regulate plants or inform citizens, Abbott suggested folks just ""drive around"" and ask at likely facilities – and hope for the best."

459|Microsoft to End Sales of Original Kinect for Windows Sensor|"It's out with the old and in with the new for Microsoft, which will phase out sales of the original Kinect for Windows sensor.

The tech giant began shipping its Kinect for Windows v2 sensor in July and released the full version of the SDK 2.0 in October, so Redmond intends to end sales of its first-gen device in 2015.

""The move to v2 marks the next stage in our journey toward more natural human computing,"" the Kinect for Windows team wrote in a blog post.

The new sensor provides enhanced body tracking, greater depth fidelity, full 1090p high-definition video, new active infrared capabilities, and an expanded field of view.

Its software development kit, meanwhile, comes with a number of updates, including the ability to create and publish Kinect-enabled apps in the Windows Store.

""The response of the developer community to Kinect v2 has been tremendous: Every day we are seeing amazing apps built on the capabilities of the new sensor and SDK,"" the Kinect team said. ""And since we released a public beta of SDK 2.0 in July, the community has been telling us that porting their original solutions over to v2 is smoother and faster than expected.""

The $199 Kinect for Windows v2 sensor (pictured) allows developers to create gesture-based applications for the Windows operating system.

The company first tipped Kinect for Windows v2 last year, and started taking pre-orders this June, ahead of the July 15 ship date.

""We hope everyone will embrace the latest Kinect technology as soon as possible,"" Microsoft said this week, though it acknowledged that some customers will want the original sensor and SDK.

""If you're one of them and need a significant number of original Kinect for Windows sensors, please contact us as soon as possible,"" Microsoft urged. ""We will do our best to fill your orders, but no more original sensors will be manufactured after the current stock sells out.""

""We know that your proven track record doing great things with the original technology will only get better with v2,"" the team continued. ""The improvements in quality from the original Kinect for Windows sensor to the v2 device are truly immense.""

Microsoft sells a standalone Kinect for Xbox One for $149. Previously, you could not connect the Xbox One Kinect to a Windows 8 device, but with a $49.99 adapter released in October, you can.

Microsoft this year began selling the Xbox One without a Kinect sensor for $399. The new option brings the console's price in line with Sony's rival PlayStation 4. Two months later, Redmond reported more than double its U.S. sales of the cheaper machine.

461|4 New Year's resolutions for investors|"CAPITOL HILL - The atmosphere inside the House chamber was electric. Nearly all of the 535 members of the House and Senate were present, along with four Supreme Court justices and several presidential candidates, including Senators Marco Rubio, Bernie Sanders and Lindsey Graham, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

Tickets were hard to get to witness Pope Francis make history Thursday as the first leader of the Roman Catholic Church to address a joint meeting of Congress. The occasion had the feeling of a presidential inauguration and a State of the Union address rolled into one. But it was less partisan in tone and the reactions to it were less mixed.

The pontiff from Argentina, whose first language is Spanish, spoke softly, slowly and deliberately in accented English. Lawmakers listened attentively, many of them on the edge of their chairs.

Pope Francis addresses a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress in the House of Representatives Chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Sept. 24, 2015.



Although his manner was gentle, Pope Francis quickly made the point that every member of Congress has a responsibility to work tirelessly for the common good. He called on Congress to break out of the cycle of polarization and paralysis, to work together to ""heal the world's open wounds.""

His call for a ""renewed spirit of cooperation"" comes at a time when the divisive Congress may be only one week away from triggering a partial government shutdown.



Pope Francis made the Golden Rule from the Bible's New Testament the cornerstone of his speech: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" He applied it to the Syrian refugee crisis and to the thousands of migrants from Latin America who travel north to the United States in search of a better life.

Democrats in the chamber, most of whom support immigration reform, applauded enthusiastically when Francis said foreigners should not be feared ""because most of us were once foreigners.""

He challenged everyone not to see migrants as numbers, but as faces.

""The yardstick we use for others is the yardstick which time will use for us,"" he said.

The pope also spoke clearly about human activity causing climate change, saying Congress has an important role to play in minimizing the damage caused by environmental degradation.

The pope explicitly called for the abolition of the death penalty and said society can benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.

Francis' plea for the sanctity of marriage and the family, and respect for life at all stages won him an enthusiastic standing ovation from Republicans, while some Democrats did not applaud.

But overall, the pope was received warmly and with respect by all of the members.



Lawmakers were on their best behavior, after having received guidance and pleas from congressional leaders. Heeding instructions, members let the pontiff walk down the center aisle to deliver the speech without trying to shake his hand or hug him.



It was a rare moment of unity for a Congress that is bitterly divided on a number of substantive issues.

Republican Representative Michael McCaul said the pope was not speaking as a Democrat or a Republican, but as someone giving moral direction. The word most often used by lawmakers to describe the speech was ""extraordinary.""

House Speaker John Boehner wept openly several times, both during the speech and afterwards. As a devout Catholic, Boehner said he prayed for the pope every day growing up, and that standing next to one was a ""humbling experience.""



In a written statement, Boehner said: ""Let us all go forth and live up to the words.""

Democratic Minority leader Nancy Pelosi is also a devout Catholic. She released a statement saying: ""Standing in the very heart of our democracy, Pope Francis spoke to the better angels of our nature and of the American people. He reminded us of our sacred and inescapable responsibility to those struggling to escape poverty, persecution and war.""



Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had a spot up in the Visitor's Gallery. He told VOA he thought the speech was ""great.""

Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who also is seeking his party's presidential nomination in 2016, had this say to VOA about the pope's call for compassion for migrants: ""When we speak of welcoming immigrants, I believe that should refer to legal immigrants.""

Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running for president as a Democrat, also used part of the pope's speech to highlight his main campaign issue, telling VOA: ""Most importantly, what he said today: the function of an economy is not just to make the rich richer; the function of the economy is to serve all the people."""
462|Nearly 100 Unaccounted for in Ferry Disaster|"(Newser) – There are still 98 people unaccounted for in the Greek ferry disaster, according to an Italian prosecutor, but that number is really murky: As the AP reports, discrepancies in the ship's records and a chaotic rescue effort mean officials don't know whether these people ever boarded the Norman Atlantic, if they died in the fire that broke out aboard it or in the stormy seas that battered it, or if they were rescued by one of the many ships that responded. Complicating matters is the continuing stormy weather in the area, which is preventing both authorities from towing the ferry to Italy and any real investigation into what went wrong.

Without bringing the Norman Atlantic in, prosecutor Giuseppe Volpe says it's impossible ""to see if there are bodies aboard ... to ascertain what caused the fire and to see if safety measures were respected."" Snow fell in the area today, and winds of up to 45mph were thwarting the tugboat operator attempting to secure the ferry. ""The shipwreck that we are towing is not anchored, and so it tends to move,"" says the owner of the tug company, which lost two workers in the effort yesterday.

463|The Ultimate Legislative Review for 2014|"There has never been a better year in the age of marijuana reform in the United States than 2014. Sure, some would argue this claim, citing the 2012 victories of Colorado and Washington, which are revered as the newfound forefathers of recreational marijuana. But the girth of the legislative efforts over the past year, have proved that the rolling stone of legal weed in America is now, not only over the mountain but careening down that bastard at an unstoppable rate of speed. No longer is the majority of the nation buying into the rotten philosophies of the great pot propagandist, Uncle Sam, and the war on marijuana now appears to be strapped in the electric chair waiting for someone to pull the kill switch.

It is often said that history repeats itself, which in reviewing the successful initiatives to legalize the leaf over the past year, indicates that though a process of political evolution, the United States is bound to dwell within a post-prohibitionary existence in the very near future. These days, the majority of the American people are fed up with the drug war, convinced it has been nothing more than a scam, and more citizens are in favor of legalizing marijuana than ever before. It is for this reason that statewide initiatives to change pot laws are predicted to spread like a plague in 2015. However, the raging impetus of pot proponents across the country may have not been as strong had it not been for the exceptional progress made throughout the year. So, in the spirit of a tribute, here is an ultimate look back at the most important legislative wins in 2014, and the aftershock that can be expected over the the next two years.

Voters Legalize Recreational Marijuana in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington DC

Voters in Alaska and Oregon stepped up in 2014 and legalized recreational marijuana, passing with 53% and 55% of the votes, respectively, while those residing in the District of Columbia passed a similar measure, Initiative 71, a ballsy initiative aimed at allowing residents to cultivate cannabis in the prohibition capital of America. Of course, the idea of the average citizen deciding that marijuana should grow in the backyard of the White House crushed the ego of some congressional leaders, who weeks later, tossed an amendment into a federal spending bill that castrated the measure on Capitol Hill and spilled the blood of democracy on the streets of Washington DC.

Earlier in the year, however, the District passed a measure to decriminalize the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana, which made its way through a mandatory congressional review period unscathed – this despite the slimy, pot-hating efforts of Maryland Representative Andy Harris. Yet, in the end, Harris managed to persuade the powers-that-be to include his proposal in a trillion dollar omnibus spending bill to prohibit the use of federal and local funds to legalize a Schedule I controlled substance. Some believe that Harris’ underhanded tactic is the end for Initiative 71, while others argue that the verbiage of the measure, specifically the use of the word “enact,” is enough of a loophole to keep it alive. Unfortunately, the bill destroys the possibility of the District passing a recreational pot market, which the DC Council was in the process of developing at the time of this vicious death rattle.

The District is, however, still expected to submit Initiative 71 to Congress at the beginning of the year for its 60-day review. And while supporters are hoping for the best, no one really has any idea if the spending bill will keep legal weed out of the nation’s capital or not. At this point, the only aspect of this debacle that remains untouchable in the District is marijuana decriminalization – a law that went into effect over the summer.

Congress Prohibits DEA From Using Federal Funds to Raid Medical Marijuana, but No Ban on Weed Has Been Lifted

The same federal spending bill that may have put the kibosh on legal weed in the District of Columbia is also technically supposed to prohibit the Drug Enforcement Administration from spending tax dollars to interfere with medical marijuana states. Yet, while there is speculation that this effort quietly removed the federal ban on medicinal cannabis in the United States, it simply did not. Although the bill provides a certain level of protection for the medical marijuana community by discouraging federal prosecutors from going after these businesses and individuals with gnashing teeth, it will only do so in the 23 states with medical marijuana laws in place and not the remaining 27 – hence no federal ban has been lifted. In fact, the omnibus spending bill will only provide this shelter for the medical marijuana community until September of 2015, at which the bill is set to expire. At this time, it will be up to Congress to decide whether this legislation is renewed or snuffed out.

Medical Marijuana Passes in Minnesota and New York State

In 2014, state lawmakers in Minnesota and New York finally approved legislation to legalize medical marijuana. This was a huge deal, considering the two states had been fighting to get this done for over a decade. However, in May, the Minnesota legislature, beaten down by the tenacity of cannabis advocates, passed a measure to allow patients suffering from specific debilitating conditions to have access to non-smokable marijuana products.

In New York, pressure was put on the state legislature, as well as Governor Cuomo, to pass the Compassionate Care Act before the end of the summer session. In the end, a statewide medical marijuana program received approval, but not without sustaining some provisionary restraints, similar to those passed in Minnesota.

Medical Marijuana Passes in Maryland, So Does Decriminalization

In the spring of 2014, Governor Martin O’Malley signed legislation to legalize medical marijuana, as well as another bill that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of pot for recreational use. According to Marijuana Policy Project, the signing of these bills was the first time in American history that a governor approved two pieces of legislation on the same day to change the marijuana laws in any given state.

Marijuana Decriminalization Wins Big in November Election

Although the biggest news this year in the realm of marijuana reform has been the victories in Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia, there was also a metric ass-ton of initiatives passed across America in the November election to decriminalize the possession of marijuana. On the east coast, voters in South Portland, Maine approved this level of reform, while eight cities in Michigan voted to pass similar measures – giving way to the possibility of full legalization in 2016. Out west, in New Mexico, voters in two of the state’s largest counties removed the criminal penalties from pot possession.

Native Americans Given Permission to Legalize Marijuana on Reservations

By the end of 2014, it appeared as though the United States had experienced as much marijuana reform as it was going to in a 12-month span, but surprising news from the federal government, indicating that tribal reservations would be allowed to cultivate and sell marijuana, proved the nation was not entirely finished. The U.S. Justice Department instructed all U.S. Attorneys to no longer prosecute Native American tribes involved in “marijuana crimes,” as long as that business takes place on reservation lands. This news means individual tribes can now make the choice of whether or not to establish a cannabis market as a source of revenue, which would be economic salvation for the majority of them. Yet, only time will tell which, if any, tribes will take advantage of this opportunity.

As for 2015, it is predicted that more than 15 states will discuss measures to legalize marijuana, while Congress is expected to review somewhere around 20 bills pertaining to the reform of cannabis laws. There will also be a great deal of focus on promoting successful initiatives in California to legalize recreational marijuana in 2016, which most advocates believe will be the next big year in the realm of American pot reform.

464|Association condemns Trinidad government over per diem payment to journalists|"0 More share buttons 0 Share with your friends Submit 0 Share on Pinterest

PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad, Wednesday December 31, 2014, CMC – The Trinidad and Tobago Publishers and Broadcasters Association (TTPBA) has condemned the decision by the coalition People’s Partnership government to pay TT$15,000 (One TT dollar = US$0.37 cents) in per diem to journalists who accompanied Prime Minister Kamla Persad Bissessar on a visit to China earlier this year.

At least two of the journalists have publicly said they did not accept the money and the TTPBA said that over the decades there have been reports of alleged bribery or “gifts of token” in exchange for favours within the newsrooms of media houses.

“This is a matter that the owners and managers of media have been grappling with over the years, especially when there are rumours but no proof. In some of these instances where reporters or newsroom personnel have been confronted, there is denial. In other cases it is untrue.

“The recent issue is of grave concern since it undermines the foundation of journalistic integrity. Internal investigations are being done by the media houses where the newsroom staff members are employed and the necessary corrective action will be taken,” the TTPBA said.

The TTBPA said it was reminding newsroom personnel of their first oath as reporters, “which is to present the truth, to be fair and to be accurate in reporting and to serve in the best interest of all citizens.

“The recent turn of events means that senior management at media houses may have to implement new methods of ensuring that the integrity of our newsrooms is upheld,” the TTBPA added.

It said that the government should have stated clearly that the $15,000 per diem was to be offered to journalists ahead of the visit of the prime minister to Beijing.

“If this had been originally stated then the current unfortunate circumstance would not have appeared to have ulterior motives. We urge Government and other State bodies to examine their processes with regard to media relations in the interest of proper ethics and good governance,” the TTPBA said.

The Media Association of Trinidad and Tobago (MATT) has also condemned the payment of the per diem.

465|Temple vandalized on Christmas|"The members of Temple B'Nai Darom allow neighborhood children to play on their 3.6-acre open lot. It's all part of being a good neighbor.

But for years the Jewish synagogue has been the target of vandalism, a cost the small congregation cannot afford. Overhead night lights are destroyed at the synagogue, located at 49 Banyan Course, and there's been trespassing and destruction at the nearby cemetery.

On Christmas, no one was in the synagogue when someone used a BB gun to shoot out several of its stained glass windows and doors. Many of the metal balls rested on the ground outside the synagogue.

“I think it's a hate crime,” said Robert Levenson, the temple's president. “And when things like this happen, it's hard to keep going.”

The temple has about 80 members. Most are elderly and many are leaving the area, so the congregation is dwindling, leaving little money left over to repair vandalism, Levenson said. He is still trying to determine the cost of the most recent damage, but it could be about $2,000.

The congregation is the second oldest established in Florida, Levenson said. This synagogue was built about 50 years ago to replace a decades-older structure, he said.

Levenson said he plans to offer a reward for information that would identify the person responsible.

“This has been going on for a while, and we have to put a stop to it,” he said.

Temple member Richard Gustafson said he is certain the building was singled out because it was a Jewish worship center.

“The black side of me says it was singled out because it was (Christmas). I have to believe that it was,” Gustafson said.

Member Elaine Rajswasser said she thought that allowing local children to use the property for play would provide a measure of protection to the building.

“We're trying so hard to stay open and … this really throws us for a loop,” she said.

The building's security alarm first notified Levenson of a disturbance at the synagogue at about 5 a.m. on Christmas. Levenson filed a report with the Marion County Sheriff's Office soon after.

Nationwide, the number of anti-Semitic incidents fell by 19 percent between 2012 and 2013, according to a 2014 Anti-Defamation League report.

The ADL reported 751 incidents in 40 states and the District of Columbia in 2013.

“In the last decade we have witnessed a significant and encouraging decline in the number and intensity of anti-Semitic acts in America,” said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL national director, in a press release released earlier this year. “The falling number of incidents targeting Jews is another indication of just how far we have come in finding full acceptance in society, and it is a reflection of how much progress our country has made in shunning bigotry and hatred.”

The annual ADL audit includes incidents of assault, vandalism and harassment targeting Jews and Jewish property and institutions. It includes both criminal and noncriminal incidents reported to ADL's 27 regional offices across the country and to law enforcement.

The Marion County Sheriff's Office identified the destruction as criminal mischief.

466|Arkansas model Medicaid experiment in jeopardy|"Arkansas' model Medicaid experiment in jeopardy



Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe is interviewed in the governor's office at the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock, Ark., Monday, Dec. 29, 2014. The outgoing governor said he is cautiously optimistic that the state will keep its compromise Medicaid expansion. (AP Photo/Danny Johnston) slideshow

Arkansas became the first Southern state to expand its Medicaid program in a way that many Republicans found acceptable. The state bought private insurance for low-income people instead of adding them to the rolls of the Medicaid system, which GOP lawmakers considered bloated and inefficient.Now Arkansas could be on the brink of another distinction: becoming the first to abandon its Medicaid expansion after giving coverage to thousands of people.A wave of newly elected Republican lawmakers who ran on vows to fight so-called ""Obamacare"" — including the state's ""private option"" Medicaid expansion — has raised doubts about the future of a leading model for conservative states to gradually adapt to the federal health care law. Arkansas' incoming Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, is remaining mum on the plan's fate.""I think there's one thing that's clear and that's the private option is not going to exist in its current form,"" said Senate President Jonathan Dismang, one of several Republicans who helped craft the program and is pushing for its continuation.What happens when the Legislature meets next month could show whether there's a way forward for anti-Obama states to adopt parts of the health care law.The prospect of losing their new insurance is already causing anxiety among some of the 213,000 people in Arkansas who got coverage.""It's a big concern,"" said Arwen Dover, who works at a Little Rock store that sells flags and has been seeing a doctor for high blood pressure. ""Right now, I'm dependent on the medicine I am taking. To lose it completely would be like starting all over again.""Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia, most of them dominated by Democrats, agreed to expand their Medicaid programs to cover more low-income people under the health overhaul. The states that rejected the expansion, and the federal funds that came with it, were mostly Republican-leaning. A few GOP-led states looked for compromises. This week, Tennessee's Republican Gov. Bill Haslam announced plans for an alternative model to expand coverage.Arkansas' hybrid approach was worked out by outgoing Democratic governor Mike Beebe and the Republican-controlled Legislature. The program uses money that would otherwise go to expanding Medicaid to purchase the private insurance for the newly eligible.Subsequently, Arkansas, which has a high poverty rate, experienced the largest drop in uninsured in the country — from 22.5 percent in 2013, to 12.4 percent, according to a Gallup survey released in August.But the Republican Party made major gains nationally in the midterm election by running hard against the federal health care law. Democrats in Arkansas, who have been unanimous in their support for the expansion, were routed. Beebe is leaving office in January because of term limits.Hutchinson has acknowledged the expansion's benefit to hospitals, which wound up caring for fewer uninsured patients, but said he's worried about Arkansas' eventual share of the costs, which begins at 5 percent in 2017 and rises to 10 percent by 2020.""There's a cost aspect to it which I've said throughout the campaign needs to be measured,"" said Hutchinson, who said he won't reach a decision before late January.Continuing the program will also require a three-fourths vote in the House and Senate. Supporters barely cleared that threshold in the last session, and that was before the arrival of the newly committed anti-Obamacare candidates.""I don't believe we can afford it,"" said Republican David Wallace, one of the new House members.Supporters say the program will at least need to change, but offer little details on what they're considering.Executives of hospitals are pushing hard for the program's continuation.""I think the private option is working exactly as intended,"" said Bo Ryall, president of the Arkansas Hospital Association.The fight in Arkansas mirrors the larger fight within the GOP over whether to focus on changing the health law or just repealing it.""Arkansas is going to be ground zero for which side of the argument wins,"" said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.Yvonne Rosebud, a housekeeper who lost her job at a West Memphis hospital that closed earlier this year, said she's uncertain what she would do if she loses the coverage she's receiving under the private option. Rosebud makes $255 a week in unemployment payments, and said she wouldn't be able to afford insurance on her own.""I wouldn't have been able to go to the doctor like I should without this,"" said Rosebud, 61, who has high blood pressure and diabetes. ""With this insurance, it's really helping."""
467|Canada police: 9 dead in 3 crime scenes - Times-Gazette|"Published: December 31, 2014 12:06AM

EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — Nine people, including seven adults and two young children, were found dead at three separate crime scenes in what Edmonton’s police chief on Tuesday called the city’s worst mass murder.

Chief Rod Knecht told a news conference the killings were the result of domestic violence. The victims included a middle-aged woman found Monday night by officers who were responding to a report of a man entering the south-side home, opening fire and fleeing.

Police were later called to a house in a quiet cul de sac in the northeast Monday afternoon to check on reports of a depressed, suicidal male earlier in the evening.

“The male was not located and there was no response, and nothing suspicious was noted at the residence.”

Knecht said police received new information after midnight that prompted officers to return to the house where they found the seven bodies. He didn’t say how the victims died or what prompted police to return.

“It is a tragic day for Edmonton,” he said. “This series of events are not believed to be random acts. ... These events do not appear to be gang-related, but rather tragic incidents of domestic violence.”

The police chief didn’t give the ages of the two children, other than to say they were very young. The adult victims were all middle-aged.

Neighbor Moe Assiff said he saw officers come out and talk to a woman sitting with a man in a white car outside the house.

“She just let out a hysterical scream. It was eerie,” Assiff said.” She was screaming about her kids: ‘My kids! The kids!,’ grabbing her hair and trying to pull her hair out. The cops then ushered her down the road into a police cruiser.”

About two hours after that, the drama shifted to the VN Express Asian restaurant in the bedroom community of Fort Saskatchewan where a man matching the description of the suicidal male was found dead on Tuesday morning, Knecht said.

“Our homicide investigators have established associations and linkages between these homicides,” he said.

Police would not elaborate on the connection between the deaths.

“It’s a really complex case involving multiple locations and police have yet to identity the suicide victim so police cannot yet say with 100 percent accuracy what the connection is,” said police spokesman Scott Patterson.

In Edmonton, a city of 878,000 people, mass murders are extremely rare. Knecht said the case was the worst mass killing in the city since at least 1956, when six people were murdered.

John Etter Clark, a provincial politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for four years, killed his wife, son, three daughters and an employee of their family farm before taking his own life in 1956. Clark had been suffering from frequent nervous breakdowns in the years before the killings.

Alberta Justice Minister Jonathan Denis said in a statement that his thoughts and prayers were with the families and friends of those involved as well as with first responders."
468|With digital forces at the gate, a down year for Hollywood|"NEW YORK (AP) — Hollywood's 2014 may well go down as a mere box-office blip, or it could be Act One in a drama of coming digital disruption.

When the year's final receipts are tallied at the end of Wednesday, the final take is estimated by box-office firm Rentrak to be about $10.4 billion, a 5.2 percent drop from the record $10.9 billion of 2013. In and of itself, such a dip isn't much for Hollywood to fret about. The industry still cleared $10 billion in revenue, the year was widely viewed as a cyclical in-between to bigger years, and a number of major releases that would have moved the needle were postponed (most notably ""Furious 7,"" following Paul Walker's death, and Pixar's ""The Good Dinosaur"").

But there were also signs that pointed to long-term trouble for the movie business. A Nielsen study found movie attendance for Americans ages 12-24 dropped a worrisome 15 percent in the first nine months of the year, compared to the first nine months in 2013. The overall number of tickets sold — a meaningful statistic since it's not impacted by rising ticket prices — slid to about 1.26 billion. That means that fewer people went to the movies in 2014 than they have in the last two decades.

The crunch was felt most by exhibitors in North American, where profits dropped drastically for the country's top two chains, Regal Cinemas and AMC Theatres. To add salt in the wound, the chains were cast as the villains in the fallout of ""The Interview"" when Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton blamed them for the film's temporary cancellation.

However, amid the usual mix of hits (""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ''The Lego Movie,"" ''Gone Girl"") and misses (""Transcendence,"" ''The Legend of Hercules,"" ''A Million Ways to Die in the West""), business for the studios was steady, if less spectacular.

Universal Pictures, for example, finished fifth in total revenue out of the six major studios, but distribution head Nikki Rocco called it ""the most profitable year in the history of Universal Pictures."" The studio found success with a slate of modestly budgeted films. All of its 2014 releases, including ""Neighbors,"" ''Lucy"" and the holiday hit ""Unbroken,"" were made for less than $70 million.

Meanwhile, though, the forces of change seemed to be gathering. Netflix partnered with the Weinstein Co. to release a ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" sequel and with Adam Sandler for a series of films. The digital release of Seth Rogen's North Korea farce ""The Interview"" ($15 million in its first four days) proved that the studios are eager to test the traditional theatrical window, even if it means upsetting the exhibitors.

""I wouldn't say we're on the cusp of radical change but I think the industry as a whole needs to find ways of increasing revenue sources and changing windowing is a part of how to grow the business,"" said Rocco, who is retiring at year's end. ""Everybody has to take a look at it because the world has changed.""

Theaters have begun adapting new techniques to lure more avid movie-going. This fall, AMC and MoviePass began offering monthly subscription packages in a handful of cities — a kind of Spotify-for-movies.

Much of the movie business is now about franchise making, and a number of potentially lucrative ones were spawned in 2014. There are already plans for a trio of subsequent ""Lego"" movies, and more is on tap for ""Guardians"" and ""Big Hero 6."" Of the top 10 films of 2014, only one was wholly original: Christopher Nolan's space adventure ""Interstellar.""

Disney continues to lead the way in the franchise department, thanks to its massive partnerships with Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm. Next year, ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" are virtually assured to net billions. They join a heavy-hitting 2015 lineup that includes ""Jurassic World,"" the final ""Hunger Games"" and new ""Terminator"" and ""Mission Impossible"" installments.

""The movies next year look particularly strong and should deliver the biggest box-office year ever,"" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Rentrak. ""We'll be happy when we close the books on 2014 and open them on 2015.""

Dergarabedian is most cheered to see the studios ""walking the walk of the 52-week-a-year business model."" Warner Bros. has been one of the studios pushing to open big movies outside of standard blockbuster dates, like springtime's ""Lego."" It has also dated its 2016 ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" for March.

But Warner Bros., often the market-share leader, fell behind both 20th Century Fox and Disney in 2014. Though Warner finished strong, thanks to ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,"" several of its releases sputtered, including ""Blended"" and ""Winter's Tale."" CEO Kevin Tsujihara announced layoffs in September.

Jeff Goldstein, head of domestic distribution for Warner Bros., says the studio is still committed to deep roster of movies: ""Kevin Tsujihara is willing to even increase that, so we're really committed to a broad slate of films,"" he says.

Part of what fuels optimism is overseas markets. The year's biggest global hit, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction,"" was launched in China, where the import market (most of which were Hollywood releases) grew by nearly 50 percent from 2013. That alone offsets a 5 percent downturn in North America."

Russian Opposition Leader Held for Violating House Arrest



MOSCOW  Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalni was arrested Tuesday in Moscow and charged with violating the terms of his house arrest to take part in a protest in front of the Kremlin, the Interfax news agency reported.



Navalni was detained when he and a group of supporters were heading towards Manezh Square, outside the Kremlin walls, to stage a demonstration that had not been authorized by the authorities.



The police later escorted the opposition leader to his home, where he had been kept in preventive detention since last February, forbidden to write or receive letters or to use the telephone or internet.



The fact that they arrested me doesnt mean a thing, Navalni told his followers on Twitter.



Until his downfall, Navalni was considered a serious political rival to Russian President Vladimir Putin, after he received a third of the votes in the most recent elections for mayor of Moscow.



Hours earlier, Navalni had been sentenced to three and a half years house arrest after being convicted of economic crimes, with a suspended sentence. His brother Oleg was also convicted on the same charges but ordered by the judge to serve his sentence behind bars.



This is the most disgusting and vile of all possible sentences, Navalni said at his hearing. The authorities not only destroy their political opponents, they also destroy and torture their families.



Navalni won wide support among Russians for his campaign against corruption in the public administration and was one of the organizers of the massive anti-government protests of 2011.



The Navalni brothers were convicted of embezzling nearly half a million dollars from the Yves Rocher Vostok perfumery franchise, and additional six-figure sums from a firm that processes electronic payments.



The state prosecutor alleged that the two brothers subsequently laundered 21 million rubles ($300,000) through non-existent dummy companies.

470|Kenyatta's ICC Appearance|"Photo: ICC

At the International Criminal Court (file photo).

On 8 October 2014, Uhuru Kenyatta made history when he became the first sitting head of state to appear before the International Criminal Court. Here is a recap of how The Hague Trials Kenya covered the events that surrounded the president's visit to the Hague-based court.

Exodus of prosecution witnesses

Last year's exit of three key prosecution witnesses from the ICC case against Kenyatta seemingly pushed the case beyond redemption. These witnesses were apparently part of a group of 'insiders' who could prove his alleged role in the planned aspects of the post-election violence in or around Nakuru and Naivasha in 2007/8. You can read more about how and why Witness 4, Witness 11 and Witness 12 were withdrawn from the case here: 'How the ICC case against Kenyatta fell apart - part 1'.

What was the prosecution's case against Kenyatta?

In the ICC's decision on the confirmation of the charges against Kenyatta published on 23 January 2012, there were allegations about certain PEV planning meetings with the Mungiki sect. For instance, on 26 December 2007, in Nairobi State House, President Mwai Kibaki, Kenyatta and others allegedly met youths from ""Operation Kibaki Again"" which - according to some prosecution witnesses - was a lobby group which would allow the Mungiki to campaign for Kibaki, while concealing their identities as Mungiki. According to the decision on the confirmation of charges, the late Maina Diambo, an alleged Mungiki member, supposedly attended this meeting. You can read more about the prosecution's case regarding PEV planning meetings here: 'How the ICC case against Kenyatta fell apart - part 2'.

Summons to attend a status conference

After the prosecution admitted that it was not ready to proceed to trial on 7 October, as earlier scheduled, the ICC judges ordered that two status conferences should be convened to discuss two issues: cooperation between the government of Kenya and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as the way forward in the case against Kenyatta. Interestingly, the judges ordered Kenyatta to attend the second status conference in person.

Although both the prosecution and the defence agreed that the case was on its last legs, they disagreed on why and how this happened. You can read more here: 'Kenya's President called to The Hague with ICC case at critical juncture'.

Would Kenyatta attend the status conference?

An opinion piece on our website argued that Kenyans are in the business of making history, and Kenyatta's presence at the ICC would be no different. To validate this proposition, the author argued that because youths threw shoes at Kenyatta during a rally in Migori County and a grown man decided to flog former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in broad daylight during another rally in Kwale County, ""Kenyans were moving on from their obsessive fixation with the president one spectacle at a time."" For more read here: 'So what if President Uhuru goes to the Hague!'

Kenyatta temporarily lays down power

Kenyans witnessed a one-of-a-kind show on 6 October 2014 when Kenyatta appointed his deputy, William Ruto, as acting president, a move that allegedly allowed him to appear before the ICC as a private individual.

""Nothing in my position or my deeds as president warrants my being in court. So to all those who are concerned that my personal attendance of the status conference compromises the sovereignty of the people or sets a precedence for the attendance of presidents before the court, be assured this is not the case.""

That's a section of Kenyatta's speech at the special legislative session in parliament on 6 October 2014. You can read more of Kenyatta's first of a kind speech here: 'President Kenyatta temporarily lays down power to attend ICC'.

Rolling out the red carpet

Kenyatta's decision to go to the ICC sparked rumours about high-profile diginitaries who were planning to accompany him. Interestingly, none of them turned up, and Kenyatta's convoy mainly included politicians from the Jubilee Coalition. Cartoonist GADO best captured the alleged planned entourage.

Kenyatta arrives in The Hague

On 7 October 2014, President Uhuru Kenyatta and around 100 Kenyan members of parliament, dignitaries and well-wishers spent the night at the Kurhaus Hotel in Scheveningen, the Netherlands. Some of the faces we spotted included Minister of Foreign Affairs Amina Mohamed, ICC critic David Matsanga and journalist Joshua Sang.

The Kurhaus is one of the greatest hotels in the Netherlands. It is situated at the beach near the ICC detention centre. Kenyatta slept there in the presidential suite. For more read here: 'Visit Kenyatta's glamorous hotel'.

Uuuuhuruuu!

""Uuuuhuruuu! The gate of the prison will be open! Free our president!"" On 8 October 2014, the Sonko Rescue Team prayed and sang in front of the ICC, right before the arrival of Kenyatta. According to an eyewitness account on our website, Kenyatta's convoy showed up and showed off. You can read more here: 'Kenyans behaving badly at the ICC'.

After the status conference

""God bless the Netherlands, God bless Kenya, God bless the ICC and God bless you!"" That's what Kenyatta said minutes after leaving the ‪#‎ICC‬. He then said in Kiswahili: ""We all know how far we have come. We all know why we are here. We all know where we are going. Everyone can see there is nothing."" For more of what Uhuru had to say after his status conference read here: 'Kenyatta's Hague Speech, ""God bless Kenya, God bless the ICC'."

472|Picturing history: Carthage Jail|"Carthage Jail will ever be known as the site where the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob during the afternoon of June 27, 1844.

During the Nauvoo period of the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Carthage was the county seat of Hancock County, Illinois.

The county jail was located at Carthage. It was constructed of stone in 1839. It measured 29 by 35 feet, the walls being 2½ feet thick. The jail will ever be known as the site where the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob during the afternoon of June 27, 1844. On that occasion, John Taylor was seriously wounded and Willard Richards was grazed on the ear but otherwise unhurt.

The jail was eventually sold and used for other purposes. On Nov. 5, 1903, the LDS Church purchased the jail for $4,000. The decision to do so was authorized by President Joseph F. Smith, the son of Hyrum Smith and then-president of the church.

In 1984, the LDS Church acquired the entire block on which the jail is situated. A visitors center was later constructed and dedicated in 1989 by President Gordon B. Hinckley."

476|Xinhua Insight: New year brings hopes, challenges for new normal China - Xinhua|"BEIJING, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- When setting the growth target for 2015, China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region made it clear two mindsets should be avoided: one is the blind pursuit of expansion, the other allowing the economy go under on the pretext of a ""new normal"".

The region's statement highlights the complex task China is facing in the ""new normal"" era of slower growth -- knowing when to stand by and let the economy moderate and when to interfere to avoid a sharp slowdown that could threaten jobs and social stability.

In 2014, guided by the ""new normal"" theory, the leadership has managed to strike a balance. The economy has generally stayed on a reasonable track despite some hobbles, and a broad range of reforms necessary for the long-term sustainable growth are enjoying smooth progress.

The long list of achievements include the abolition of registered capital requirements for new firms, which caused growth in new company registrations, a landmark opening of capital accounts via the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect scheme, which permits investors in the two financial hubs to put money directly in each others' stock markets. The publication of set of draft rules on deposit insurance will pave the way for implementation next year and the issuance of long-awaited rules for a nationwide property-registration system could help control speculation in the market and aid anti-graft drive.

According to a statement issued after a meeting of China's central leading group for comprehensively deepening reform on Tuesday, 80 key reform tasks identified for 2014 had been ""basically finished"" in addition to the completion of 108 missions assigned to various central departments.

Helped in part by these efforts, some pleasant signs have already started to emerge across the economy.

A recent national survey showed a more competitive manufacturing sector that has begun to grow out of its reputation for low costs and low added value, and a service sector that started to play a bigger role in the economy with a surge in firms and jobs.

Meanwhile, China's job market has proved resilient despite slowing economic growth, with more than 13 million new jobs expected to be created this year.

Although some traditional sectors are struggling, China's young entrepreneurs are driving a wave of startups that has become a bright spot for the economic landscape and an important engine for future growth.

But the past year is just the start of a long, arduous journey. For China to successfully ride out the ""new normal"" age, a lot more efforts aimed at deepening reforms, fostering creative innovation and improving market efficiency are in need, and Chinese leaders are well aware of the challenges.

In the tone-setting economic conference in December, Chinese leaders stressed the economy still faces many challenges and ""relatively big"" downward pressures such as increasing difficulties for businesses and the emergence of economic risks.

The statement did not give a specific growth target for 2015, which is usually made public in March, but said the government will be ""reasonable"" when setting up goals and maintaining the flexibility of its macro-control policies.

The statement targeted nine areas for focused reform efforts for 2015 -- the capital market, market access for private banks, administrative approval process, investment, pricing, monopolies, franchising, government purchasing and outbound investment.

Many of these reforms -- privatizing the financial sector, streamlining administrative approvals, and encouraging investment -- are being experimented with in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. The country has planned new free trade zones in Tianjin, Guangdong and Fujian, a crucial step in taking these reforms to the next level.

China also vowed to speed up reform of its state-owned enterprises (SOEs). It has unveiled a reform plan in August for the payment packages of top executives at SOEs, part of a broader plan to reform the inefficient state sector by attracting private investment and hiring more qualified professionals to manage the firms in an increasingly market-based economy.

All combined, these reforms, though some are set to be met with vehement resistance from different interest groups, will help foster new momentum for the new normal China.

Looking ahead 2015, Mckinsey director Gordon Orr said it seemed harder to give predictions as the political and economic leaders in China have clear plans and supporting policies that they are sticking to.

""You can debate the pace at which actions are being taken, but not really the direction in which the country is travelling,"" he said."
477|Jane Says: Craft Cocktails Are All About Flavor, Not Pretension|"“What exactly is a craft cocktail? Are they hard to make at home?”

—Jamie Whitehouse

A craft cocktail is one in which the ingredients are fresh (no commercial mixes) and made or combined with care. Whenever I think of craft cocktails, I think of the person who introduced me to them—James Rodewald, the former drinks editor at Gourmet and author of the recently published American Spirit: An Exploration of the Craft Distilling Revolution. The art of storytelling, along with inspiring examples of grit, gumption, and entrepreneurship, is alive and well among today’s distillers, and Rodewald’s book has earned a place in my library next to Mountain Spirits: A Chronicle of Corn Whiskey and the Southern Appalachian Moonshine Tradition, by the masterful Joe Dabney.

When I shot off an “inquiring minds want to know” email to Rodewald the other day, he responded with alacrity. “The craft cocktail movement is the best thing to happen to drinkers since Prohibition,” he wrote. “It’s saved us from the vodka martini, not to mention abominations like the Harvey Wallbanger. But there’s really nothing new about making well-balanced drinks from great ingredients. The owner of my favorite bar in college made the best Brandy Alexander I’ve ever had. Also the best Tom Collins. And he introduced me to Green Chartreuse, which is, of course, a de rigueur ingredient on any fancy-pants cocktail list.”

After being colleagues for 10 years, I can tell when he is having fun: “The word hipster did not exist back then. The only people who had tattoos were ex-cons; piercings were, as far as I know, limited to ears,” he continued. “That bartender—an Irishman whose father may or may not have been a bootlegger in Troy, N.Y., during Prohibition—made drinks that rarely had more than three ingredients, and though many of us were just getting our cocktail careers started, he taught us to appreciate quality over quantity.”

Ah, Prohibition. It brought the golden age of the cocktail to a screeching halt. In The Craft of the Cocktail: Everything You Need to Know to Be a Master Bartender, With 500 Recipes, Dale DeGroff explains the zenith of that golden age, the 1870s, was when all the elements fell into place: refrigeration technology; charged water (i.e., soda water); the perfecting of mechanical ice systems; an amazing variety of both imported and domestic bottled spirits available; a large, well-trained workforce; and consumers with money to burn. This was, DeGroff tells us, “when many of the classics were either born or perfected: the Martini, the Manhattan, the sour, the fizz, the old-fashioned, the Pousse Café, the sting, and the julep.”

Fast-forward through Repeal, the Great Depression, World War II, and the 1950s, when bartenders began to rely on powdered sweet-and-sour mixes instead of fresh, natural ingredients. In the 1980s (I know! still ancient history), DeGroff played a pivotal role in the rebirth of the classic cocktail at the still-glamorous Rainbow Room, in New York City. He approached the profession of bartending like a chef, he writes, adding that there’s no reason you can’t do the same in your own kitchen. It’s more approachable than you may think.

“Too many bars that specialize in craft cocktails seem to revel in the number and obscurity of their ingredients, but much of that is pure posing,” Rodewald writes. “The formula is simple: Use high-quality ingredients, fresh juices, and fresh ice; balance the flavors; and execute the steps properly (if you’re shaking, shake it like you mean it; if you’re stirring, make sure you have plenty of ice and stir for at least 15 seconds).” I would add to not eyeball a highball or any other cocktail. Unless you really have the ratios down, use a jigger or a mini measure calibrated in teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and milliliters to measure your ingredients.

Ice, by the way, is considered a power ingredient among mixologists and other experts. “The discovery of fire—or, more accurately, the ability to create and manage fire—gets all the attention in anthropology texts,” Rodewald wrote in the October 2005 issue of Gourmet, “but ice might be an object of even greater obsession, particularly during the last two millennia, and particularly among America’s best bartenders.” As Rodewald points out, “You wouldn’t dream of cooking in rancid oil, so why would you use anything but clean, fresh ice?” So freeze good water and use ice trays that form large solid cubes instead of itty-bitty ones that melt quickly, thus diluting a drink instead of keeping it cold.

As far as the spirits go, “price doesn’t guarantee quality,” writes DeGroff, “but in most cases, you get what you pay for.” Such is life, in other words. You’ll see craft cocktails made with traditional premium brands of gin, vodka, bourbon, scotch, rye, rum, tequila, brandy, and so on, as well as those made by small-scale craft distillers. How do you know if a spirit is really made by a craft distiller? Rodewald to the rescue.

“It’s impossible to imagine that the already overburdened agency of the federal government that is tasked with regulating the booze business, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) would be willing or able to create labeling rules to help consumers easily determine who actually made the stuff they’re drinking,” he writes in American Spirit. “The best advice I can give to anyone who wants to support true craft distillers is to make sure the label says ‘Distilled By’ and not just ‘Produced By,’ ‘Bottled By,’ or ‘Made By.’ That’s not a guarantee—people will lie, and Big Booze’s lawyers and lobbyists will certainly figure out a way to get around even that rule if the craft market becomes big enough—but it’s all we’ve got at the moment.”

One encouraging development was the formation, in 2013, of the American Craft Distillers Association, and Rodewald, for one, would be surprised and disappointed if they didn’t hammer out some sort of voluntary labeling system so that consumers can make more informed choices. A complicating factor is that the definition of the term craft distiller is still a work in progress. Dave Pickerell, the former distiller at Maker’s Mark, now runs a consulting business for small whiskey makers. He’s seen it all and from both sides. “I think there are three sets of craft,” Rodewald quotes him as saying. “Those that are making their own equipment, those that are making their own juice, and those who are taking something they bought and putting a spin on it—a blend or whatever—and bringing a new taste to market.”

Whatever. I don’t know about you—I’m getting thirsty. But I’m not sure for what, exactly. Again, over to Rodewald.

“This time of year, if there’s a holiday crowd in need of lubrication, I might whip up a batch of Baltimore Eggnog, using eggs from a farmer I like and the best cream I can find,” he says. “It’s incredibly rich but extremely satisfying, so a little goes a long way. (In the unlikely event that there’s some left over, I run it through my ice cream maker.) Here’s the recipe as it ran in the December 1945 issue of Gourmet: To serve 25 people, beat 2 dozen egg yolks until light and lemon-colored. Add to the yolks 1 bottle (4/5 quart) brandy, 1 pint Jamaica rum, 2 pounds confectioners sugar, 3 quarts whole sweet milk, 1 quart heavy cream, and 1 teaspoon salt, beating slowly all the while during the adding of the ingredients, to allow the spirits to cook the egg yolks. Finally, fold in the 24 egg whites, beaten stiff with 3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg. Eggnog may be bottled, corked tightly, and kept in the refrigerator until wanted. If so kept, the fluffiness of the egg whites will diminish, but this will not harm the flavor of the drink.”

Okay, I’m in. Cheers, and Happy New Year!

480|An amazing outpouring of help, AsiaOne Malaysia News|"According to K.G. Tan, they are arranging to fly in 50 Family Survival Packs (FSPs) to kick-start their rebuilding communities work in the affected areas.

PETALING JAYA: Malaysians are a very generous lot, and they proved it yet again with an outpouring of help for the flood victims in the east coast states. The response to the The Star-MRCS-Firefly Relief Fund has been so overwhelming that it exceeded the airline's daily cargo capacity to fly the goods to Kota Baru and Kuala Terengganu.

Firefly chief executive officer Ignatius Ong said that to date, 73,000kg of dry food, personal care and medical supplies had been delivered to the two cities where representatives from IMAM Response and Relief Team (Imaret) - a team powered by the Islamic Medical Association of Malaysia (Imam), Mercy Malaysia and TUDM Oscar were collecting and distributing items to the various flood relief centres.

""Our call for solidarity and donation resulted in an outpouring of support from all quarters. In fact, the donation exceeded our daily cargo capacity although we have a minimum of 10 daily flights to Kota Baru and five to Kuala Terengganu out of Subang Skypark,"" said Ong.

""We were very fortunate to be able to call on our friends from Malaysia Airlines, MASKargo and TUDM Oscar to assist with the air and ground logistics to ensure that all donations are sent to the east coast as soon as possible. We thank them for their swift response - it was a matter of minutes of discussion before we had an agreement to work together and the various assets were mobilised immediately,"" he added.

The airline has also flown 335 medical practitioners from the Health Ministry and Imaret to the east coast to provide medical services and assistance.

Ong said over 200 volunteers from among the Firefly management and staff, non-governmental organisations and the public had been working at the three donation centres - Subang Skypark Terminal, Penang International Airport and Sultan Ismail Petra Airport in Kota Baru.

""We are amazed and humbled by the compassion and generosity shown and will continue to provide our services as long as it takes. We are honoured to be part of the chain,"" he added.

Donors are reminded to ensure items are packed properly in boxes, sealed and labelled before dropping them off at any of the three donation centres."

483|Man kills eight people in shooting mass murder in Canada|"Members of the coroner's office remove a body from one of three crime scenes where a total of nine people were found dead in north Edmonton, Alberta, December 30, 2014 Police cordon tape surrounds a house (R, with lights on) where seven people were found dead, in one of three separate crime scenes, in north Edmonton, Alberta, December 30, 2014 Members of the coroner's office remove a body from one of three crime scenes where a total of nine people were found dead. Police found seven dead including two children inside this home, located in north Edmonton, Alberta, December 30, 2014

Edmonton Police Chief Rod Knecht told a news conference said the motive for the “senseless mass murder” appears to have been “planned and deliberate” domestic violence.

Knecht did not release the name of the suspect, but said the man was well-known to police and had a criminal record dating back to September 1987.

Cindy Duong (37) was fatally shot in a home in south Edmonton on Monday, while two men and three women between the ages of 25 and 50, and a girl and a boy – both under 10 – were found dead a few hours later at a home in the northeast.

Investigators have determined the 9mm handgun used to kill Duong was a registered weapon that had been stolen in British Columbia in 2006. The suspect was found dead by his own hand in a restaurant in the Edmonton community of Fort Saskatchewan on Tuesday.

Duong’s body was found at around 7pm on Monday when police responded to a report of a man entering the south-side home, opening fire and fleeing.

An hour and a half later, officers responded to reports of a suicidal man at a northeast residence in a quiet cul de sac, the same home where the suspect had been arrested in November 2012 and charged with domestic and sexual assault.

Family members reported in the call that the man was “depressed and over-emotional”.

When officers arrived, no one answered the door. They searched the exterior of the home but found nothing and did not go inside. “We can’t just arbitrarily go into that residence,” explained the chief.

Hours later, police were contacted by a second person and returned to the residence. When they went in, they found a scene of carnage with seven bodies.

Neighbour Moe Assiff said he saw officers come out and talk to a woman sitting with a man in a white car outside the house.

“She just let out a hysterical scream. It was eerie,” Assiff said. “She was screaming about her kids: ‘My kids! The kids!,’ grabbing her hair and trying to pull her hair out.”

The suspect’s body was found hours later in Fort Saskatchewan after police surrounded the area and smashed through the front of the restaurant.

484|Getting it Straight: David Chiu and the LGBT Caucus are No Match.|"Menlo Park Assemblyman Rich Gordon, the chairman of the California Legislature's LGBT caucus, cannot say he foresaw the day when straight politicians would be clamoring to join the LGBT caucus.

That would certainly seem to be some measure of ""progress."" With that said, much as Trix is for kids, the LGBT caucus remains reserved for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people.

A January agenda item for the group, however, queries whether San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, a straight man, should be allowed in.

Attempting to join the LGBT caucus has been described as a ""campaign promise"" Chiu made while running against openly gay Supervisor David Campos for higher office. Chiu is out of the country but his chief of staff, Judson True, said Chiu's promise was less specific. It was more about ""standing as a strong straight ally"" and less about, specifically, joining the LGBT caucus. ""Support can take many forms.""

Well, good — because one needn't be a soothsayer to realize the LGBT caucus isn't about to remake itself: ""I am not sure there's huge support for changing our rules at this point,"" says Gordon.

Chiu will have to content himself with membership in the Legislature's Asian Pacific Islander Caucus. And a charming wife."
485|Report this underage relationship|"Report this underage relationship

DEAR ABBY: My 16-year-old daughter, ""Sierra,"" started baby-sitting in the afternoons for a couple when she was 15. Sometimes her dad or I would drop her off; sometimes the husband, ""Karl,"" would before he left for work. My husband and Karl became friends, and when Karl and his wife split up, we let him stay on our couch for a few months.

Then we found out Sierra was pregnant and that she and Karl had been sleeping together before he split with his wife. My daughter is upset that we want to involve the police and press charges because she was underage. How can I get Sierra to stop hating me and understand that this relationship isn't healthy?

— ""The Enemy Mom"" in South Carolina

DEAR ""ENEMY MOM"": Sierra is mad at you because you are injecting an unwelcome note of reality into her fantasy of ""love."" Karl is a predator who needs to be answerable for what he did. He will also have to support that child until he or she is no longer a minor.

Because he has shown himself to be amoral and irresponsible, involve not only the police but also the department of social services to ensure that he lives up to all of his responsibilities.

More Information

DEAR ABBY: It was brought to my attention that an employee in my workplace was asked by his supervisor if he would be OK with working with a gay male before the person was interviewed. Is this even legal?

She basically ""outed"" the potential employee in the workplace.

If the person she asked did have a problem working with someone who's gay, it implies the man wouldn't have been hired, which would be discrimination, wouldn't it? Couldn't that lead to a possible lawsuit? Or am I wrong?

— Right or Wrong in Wisconsin

DEAR RIGHT OR WRONG: I discussed your question with an attorney from Lambda Legal, the national organization committed to achieving full recognition of the civil rights of LGBT people. Currently, 21 states plus the District of Columbia have laws that protect gay people from employment discrimination. Wisconsin is one of them.

The attorney said that ""outing"" the candidate to the other employee was ""not necessarily illegal,"" but that it was ""DEFINITELY a bad business practice.""

In the 21 states that offer protection for gay people, a prospective employer cannot base a hiring decision on how comfortable someone is with the candidate's sexual orientation, or the perception that a co-worker or customer might be uncomfortable with a gay person. That is discrimination, and it IS illegal.

DEAR READERS: The year is almost over — I can't believe how fast it has gone! Please accept my heartfelt wish for a happy, healthy and prosperous 2015. And if you are partying this evening, please be safe!

— Love, Abby"

PHILADELPHIA – Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty against a Philadelphia-area couple charged in the torture death of the woman’s 3-year-old son.

Officials said Jillian Tait and Gary Lee Fellenbaum III went shopping and ate pizza as the boy lay dying after weeks of escalating abuse.

They were formally charged Wednesday with murder, child abuse, conspiracy and other crimes during their video arraignment from a Chester County prison.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported the couple did not speak at the brief hearing. They have pleaded not guilty to the charges and earlier waived a preliminary hearing.

Authorities said Scott McMillan was hung upside and beaten with a frying pan before his Nov. 4 death in the family’s mobile home in Coatesville. They say his 6-year-old brother was also abused.

489|Police recover man's body from popular Nimbin swimming hole|"Police recover man's body from popular Nimbin swimming hole

Posted

Police have found a body believed to be that of a man who disappeared at a popular swimming hole in far northern New South Wales.

The 19-year-old had been with friends at Hanging Rock Falls, north-west of Nimbin, on Tuesday.

Police said the man was using a rope to swing out over the waterhole when he hit a rock face and fell into the water. He did not resurface.

Despite efforts from friends and bystanders he could not be found.

Police, NSW Ambulance paramedics and the Westpac Rescue Helicopter also failed to find any trace of the man.

A further search on Wednesday morning located a body.

While the body has not yet been formally identified, police believe it is the missing man from the state's Illawarra region.

An investigation is underway into the circumstances surrounding his death.

The swimming spot is popular with tourists and a number of people have been injured or died there.

Locals living nearby said the waterhole was dangerous to visitors and up to seven metres deep in some places.

A 14-year-old boy died after falling into the waterhole four years ago.

His body was found in deep water by a police diving team.

The swimming hole is on a crown reserve and is the responsibility of the NSW Government.

A spokesman for the NSW Department of Crown Land said a sign warning against swimming at the waterhole was put up three years ago after the death of the 14-year-old.

He said the department would cooperate with any inquiry arising from the current incident.

While most of the American economy has struggled the past few years companies with a hand in agriculture have enjoyed a good ride.

New trade deals in 2015 could provide crop and livestock farmers with even more opportunities to sell their commodities, a major farm group said this week.

Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union, said changes to the nation's trading relationship with Cuba — announced in December by the White House — will remove barriers and make U.S. agriculture more competitive, creating more customers in the communist country.

Congress also may take action in 2015 on a pair of trade deals — the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement with 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a pact with the European Union.

""The time is now to open a new chapter on America's trade policies,"" Johnson said. ""Moving forward, let's make sure these deals have real, balanced and fair benefits for us, before we put our names on them.""

U.S. producers shipped a record $152.5 billion in fiscal 2014, according to the Agriculture Department. Shipments are expected to decline by as much as $9 billion during the current fiscal year, due largely to lower prices for corn, soybeans and other commodities.

Johnson called 2014 "" a positive and progressive year"" for agriculture, citing passage of the farm bill and continued support for Country of Origin Labeling and the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires increasing the amount of ethanol added to the country's gasoline supply.

""The RFS has breathed new life into rural America,"" he said. ""Making sure it stays on track is one of NFU's top priorities.""

Some congressional lawmakers are considering legislation that would change or repeal the Renewable Fuel Standard.

493|Islamic State ask on Twitter how to kill captured Jordanian pilot|"Islamic State ask on Twitter how to kill captured Jordanian pilot

San Antonio Post Wednesday 31st December, 2014

• The pilot, Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh, 26, a first lieutenant in Jordan's air force, was captured after his F-16 jet crash-landed near the Syrian city of Raqqa

• According to Vocative, some of the ideas shared by ISIS followers to kill Moaz include beheading him, burning him alive and running him over with a bulldozer.

• But people have also taken to Twitter to post on a hashtag that translates as ""We are all Moaz"", praising the pilot and offering messages of support for his family.

DAMASCUS/LONDON - Islamic State militants in Syria have invited suggestions on Twitter on the best way to kill a Jordanian pilot captured last week with their gruesome Arabic hashtag ""Suggest a Way to Kill the Jordanian Pilot Pig"" being retweeted over a thousand times.

The pilot, Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh, 26, a first lieutenant in Jordan's air force, was captured after his F-16 jet crash-landed near the Syrian city of Raqqa, which is held by ISIS (also known as ISIL).

Jordan has threatened the IS with ""grave consequences"" if the pilot is harmed, while the Islamists have demanded that Jordan quit the US-led coalition and release several prisoners in exchange for his release.

Several ISIS-affiliated Twitter accounts have asked the organization's followers to suggest ways of killing Kaseasbeh.

Kasaesbeh, also known as Moaz, was captured by IS fighters on Christmas Eve.

The IS published an interview with the pilot in Dabiq, its monthly English-language magazine, last week. The piece ends with the question ""Do you know what the Islamic State will do with you?"" To which Al-Kasasbeh replies: ""Yes They will kill me"".

According to Vocative, some of the ideas shared by ISIS followers to kill Moaz include beheading him, burning him alive and running him over with a bulldozer.

Many of the Twitter posts contained graphic embedded images, including photographs of beheadings and of wounded children. One showed a steamroller captioned with a message that translates into ""Goodbye Moaz"", while another featured a stock picture saying ""Nothing better than the axe"".

Another hashtag that translates as ""We all want to slaughter Moaz"" has been tweeted thousands of times too. That hashtag featured doctored images of the pilot with IS soldiers, including one of the man being held by ""Jihadi John"", the IS member that the group claims was behind the killing of many of the British and US men shown in videos released this year.

But people have also taken to Twitter to post on a hashtag that translates as ""We are all Moaz"", praising the pilot and offering messages of support for his family.

One participant, claiming to be the mother of a Syrian man killed by a coalition air strike, suggested that Kaseasbeh should be ""impaled and hung on a pole so that he dies slowly. And it would be mercy to kill him by gun or a knife"".

Moaz's plane was the first US-led coalition aircraft to be lost on IS territory since air strikes began in September.

The jihadist group claimed it had shot down the jet with a heat-seeking missile near the city of Raqqa.

But the Jordanian government and U.S. Central Command described the incident as an aircraft crash and adamantly stated that it was not shot down by ISIS.

""I checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning,"" the pilot is quoted as saying. ""The plane began to deviate from its normal flight path, so I ejected.

496|Let Americans ask the right questions|"U.S. Army Military Police escort a detainee to his cell in Camp X-Ray at Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during in-processing to the temporary detention facility.

If not for US President Barack Obama’s bold, unexpected diplomatic breakthrough with Cuba, the last weeks of 2014 would have been relentlessly unkind to America. The deep flaws in the country’s justice system, the continuing racism in its society and the American government’s recent record of torture and abuse have been on display for the entire world to see.

The video of five police officers subduing and then killing a man, despite his pleas that he could not breathe, could have come from many countries around the world. But the killing of Eric Garner in New York City, like that of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer, and of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland in November, reflect the heightened risk that young African-American men face at the hands of the police in many US cities. Indeed, according to one recent analysis, young African-American males are 21 times more likely than young white males to be fatally shot by the police.

Then came the release by the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence of 528 pages of its report on the CIA’s detention and interrogation programme, established following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America. What the committee described as an “executive summary” detailed horrific behaviour by government officials acting on instructions from their superiors.

Worse, rather than seeking to make amends for the abuses, at least one group of former US officials sought to justify them. When asked on US television about the estimated 25 per cent of detainees who were innocent, former US vice-president Dick Cheney responded: “I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective. And our objective is to get the guys who did 9/11 and it is to avoid another attack against the United States.” For their part, some current CIA officials continue to insist on the value of America’s “enhanced interrogation” programme (which Obama halted), despite the Senate report’s conclusion that the techniques it employed yielded no valuable intelligence.

Indeed, other accounts of America’s “global war on terror” also make it clear that many of the people who were detained and tortured were not threats to America’s security — at least not until US actions made them so. The week the Senate report came out, I was reading Anand Gopal’s new book No Good Men Among the Living, which tells contemporary Afghanistan’s story through the eyes of a supporter of former president Hamid Karzai, a Taliban commander, and a Kabul-born housewife who spent years in purdah (veil) in Taliban country.

Over and over again, the same story plays out: A local power-broker is willing, even eager, to support the new US-backed government, only to be denounced as a Taliban member by a fellow Afghan — typically for local political or personal reasons — to unwitting American troops. Indeed, this pattern recurs in the accounts of anyone who has lived in Afghanistan, spoken the language and understood the workings of patronage and power there. It was often these denounced men who were detained — and tortured — for years.

From my vantage point as a US foreign-policy expert, the only bright spot in recent months has been Obama’s normalisation of diplomatic relations with Cuba. Finally, America has an opportunity to launch a new beginning, not only with Cuba, but also with the Caribbean and Latin American countries that have pressed us hard and often to change our stance. Indeed, the move will stand as one of Obama’s most substantial foreign-policy achievements, with implications that will reverberate for decades.

Yet, a common theme runs through all of these recent events, good and bad alike. In each case, US institutions and officials held other US institutions and officials to account. Congress documented and publicised the actions of the executive branch in the torture report. Senator Dianne Feinstein worked doggedly to ensure that the Senate Intelligence Committee could research and document US interrogation practices, even in the face of staunch opposition by the CIA (which even surreptitiously searched the committee’s computers).

“There are those who will seize upon the report and say ‘see what Americans did,’” Feinstein said, “and they will try to use it to justify evil actions or to incite more violence. We cannot prevent that. But history will judge us by our commitment to a just society governed by law and the willingness to face an ugly truth and say ‘never again.’”

Likewise, the press and many civil-society groups documented and publicised not only the killings of Brown, Garner and others, but also how those cases reflected a pattern of racially disparate treatment by the police. And when Obama announced the restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba, the White House described the last half-century of US policy as a “failed approach”, isolating the US, constraining its influence in hemispheric politics and tying its hands in Cuba itself.

Americans are no better (and no worse) than anyone else. They have no right to moralise and they have much to learn from others. Fortunately, their founding fathers gave them the exceptional gift of a political system that pushes them continually in the direction of self-correction. The ability to correct wrongdoing can never justify doing wrong in the first place. The point of exposure is not to celebrate America’s ability to expose. Americans must learn how to look at themselves and their government the way others do. They have much to answer for, but at least they know that they have asked the right questions.

497|Public private partnership model in India needs a revamp: UR Bhat|"Public private partnership model in India needs a revamp: UR Bhat

ET Now: Thre infrastructure and a lot of other sectors have caught whiff of how big a reform would the land ordinance bill be for them in terms of setting up projects. Is that the reason why that entire pack of power ancillaries, power, infrastructure etc. did so well yesterday? Is it a meaningful change that will really re-rate some of these companies as well?

UR Bhat: It probably takes some time for it to be sustainable. The problems that infrastructure and metal companies had in India was about resource allocation including land and coal. The government is going ahead with the reforms despite the problems that we had in the Rajya Sabha. That is a very good sign. The government is committed to solving the problems of the infrastructure business. All said and done, if you really see, in infrastructure if the government is really harping on public private partnership. There are probably not more than 20 people who can partner with the government in putting up infrastructure projects. All these guys are overextended as far as debt is concerned. There has to be some solution to these problems if there has to be some headway in PPP. The government is seized to the matter and I am sure they are putting their best foot forward to solve these problems."

499|7 NI political hot potatoes for early 2015|"1. Expect Mitchel McLaughlin to be finally elected as Speaker of the NI Assembly.

If the Welfare Reform Bill passes its Consideration Stage by the end of February (as the financial package requires), will the DUP withdraw their objection and allow Sinn Féin’s Mitchel McLaughlin to be elected as Speaker? They’ll surely not wait until the Bill receives Royal Assent? Mitchel’s elevation will create a vacancy for a Deputy Speaker. Who will the DUP nominate from within their ranks? Realistically the role will go to an older back bencher. And will the DUP and Sinn Féin agree to give one Deputy Speaker (the DUP one) the honorary badge of Principal Deputy Speaker?

2. Can the parties meet their Advent Agreement Stormont House Agreement commitments in the first few months of 2015 while election campaigning starts?

With the Westminster election on 7 May 2015, and the dissolution of Parliament on the 30 March, the campaign will start in earnest towards the end of February, particularly in key seats like East Belfast, South Belfast and Fermanagh & South Tyrone.

The parties – well Sinn Féin and the DUP at a minimum – need to hold it together and in order to agree key decisions and satisfy Treasury demands around the financial package and legislation to devolve Corporation Tax:

Final budget agreed in January 2015.

2015. Welfare Reform Bill legislation before Assembly in 2015 and passing Consideration Stage by end of February 2015.

2015. Opposition arrangements and support to be put in place by the Assembly by March 2015.

2015. Establish a Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition by June 2015.

2015. OFMdFM to bring forward legislative proposals – including Code of Conduct, criteria, accountability – on parades and related protests (via the Office of Legislative Counsel) to the Executive by June 2015.

2015. Establish a compact civic advisory panel by June 2015 that will meet regularly, consider key social, cultural and economic issues, and to advise the NI Executive

3. Is there any political mileage left in poring over On The Runs?

Tony Blair has been summoned to give evidence to the NI Affairs Committee’s inquiry into the administrative scheme for On The Runs on Wednesday 14 January. His answers – tone, content and completeness – are unlikely to build trust between republicans and unionists. But are there any votes to be won or lost this year over the matter?

4. Expect schools to get at least a partial budget reprieve.

In November, schools were informed about budget cuts. (The same week, schools report receiving glossy brochures, thick paper curriculum updates and posters for staff rooms from the department, boards and CCEA, along with outside consultants contracted to DENI booking in to find out about testing paid for and run by schools outside department control … which sounds like there’s still some flab in the core still to be cut before the schools deserve to be hit.)

For large schools, the cut in next year’s budget would be several hundred thousand pounds. Given that staffing makes up the greatest proportion of school budgets, it classroom assistant posts and some teaching positions are at risk. Some schools will not be replacing retiring senior staff, such as vice principals.

However, given that the reluctance to respond to school requests to be furnished with final firm budgets, it seems likely that the officials are holding out for a better settlement in the New Year.

5. Will big house unionism make a fuss over the cancellation of the north Belfast parading panel?

Back on the 7 October, the Secretary of State published the Terms of Reference for her panel of experts who were meant “to examine parading issues in the Ardoyne / Twaddell area of north Belfast”. The panel were to report by 31 January 2015. No panel was ever appointed, and it was alleged that many people approached to chair or serve on the panel refused. While the announcement of the “Twaddell panel” made it to the NIO website, the statement announcing the cancellation of the unappointed panel was not so publicly archived!

The aim of the panel was mediation and dialogue, but effective mediation cannot take place without meaningful engagement from both sides. It has become apparent that there is insufficient support for the proposed panel among some of those most closely involved in the dispute. This is reflected, to varying degrees, on both sides of the community. We have therefore decided, on balance, not to go ahead with setting up the panel. [via BBC]



The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland described Theresa Villiers of showing “contempt” and “will be meeting with unionist political representatives [after Christmas] to discuss the seriousness of the situation, created by a weak Secretary of State”. The Unionist Coalition (with its graduated response) seemed to collapse before Christmas, and the Unionist Forum hasn’t been heard of in public for many months. Will the DUP and UUP have any appetite to go further than verbal sham sparring and put up an actual fight?

North Belfast is pretty safe for Nigel Dodds in the first-past-the-post Westminster election, so unless another party fields a strong and loud candidate, will the parading issues in north Belfast simply roll over to the Parades Commission next summer (assuming parading isn’t devolved any sooner than the next parliament)?

6. Do political parties really want to address economic deprivation in Northern Ireland?

The Shadow Secretary of State’s Heenan-Anderson Commission has less trouble recruiting members and is examining the causes of the current levels of economic marginalization and deprivation in Northern Ireland. (Submissions close on 31 January.)

When the panel’s ideas on interventions to improve outcomes are collated together and printed in black and white, it’ll be interesting to see the reaction of local business/industry, civic society and political parties. The panel will report by early March so Ivan Lewis can feed proposals into the Labour manifesto … and in time for good ideas to be pinched by other local parties!

7. Do NI21 have the energy for one last night of the long knives?

Douglas Bain is expected to report on the complaints made to him by former staff of NI21, allegations which the party leader denies. The NI Assembly Commissioner for Standards will have to judge which allegations fall within the Code of Conduct’s notion of what “Members say or do in their capacity as an elected Member of the Assembly” and which fall under “their private and family life”. While NI21 has already lost more members than I’ve had hot dinners in 2014, the scope and tone – never mind the conclusions – of Bain’s report will strongly influence who remains active in NI21 … those loyal to NI21’s ideals, or those loyal to the current leader.

Bonus 8. If you see Gary Hart, tell him the sham war on welfare is over … but we might need him before the end of the year!

500|Westminster Boy Missing Since Tuesday Afternoon Found Safe « CBS Denver|"December 31, 2014 11:34 AM

WESTMINSTER, Colo. (AP/CBS4) — Police in Westminster who asked the public for help in finding a missing 12-year-old boy said he was found safe at a friend’s house.

Salvador Fierro left his home in the 11700 block of Decatur Street on foot to go a friend’s home in the area of 11500 Pecos Street on Tuesday afternoon but never arrived.

Police say they began an extensive search for Salvador after he was reported missing and notified residents in the area to watch out for him.

Temperatures dropped below zero during the search for Salvador.

On Wednesday morning police sent out a reverse 911 call to residents in the area of the 11200 to the 12000 block between Federal Boulevard and Huron Street. They also requested help from the Denver Police Department helicopter in the search.

Just after 11 a.m. on Wednesday police said the boy was found safe at a friend’s house in the area of the 11300 block of Pecos Street.

“Salvador appears in good condition and is being reunited with his mother,” police said.

Police also thanked the public for helping search for the boy.

501|Microsoft sues C-Cubed Solutions for technical support scam|"Technology giant Microsoft has sued an Indian company along with several other entities alleging that they misused its name and registered trademarks while providing fraudulent technical support services to unsuspecting consumers.



Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit filed a civil lawsuit earlier this month in federal court in the Central District of California for unfair and deceptive business practices and trademark infringement against C-Cubed Solutions, which is a ""private business company formed under the laws of India"", Omnitech Support based in California and Florida-based Anytime Techies along with two other individuals.



According to the lawsuit, C-Cubed is a ""private company associated under the laws of India."" Its directors include Marc Haberman, Rachel Eilat Haberman and Jay Wurzberger. C-Cubed is a subsidiary of California-based Customer Focus Services (CFS) and ""operates the mail server by which CFS' fraudulent technical support businesses communicate with customers,"" according to the lawsuit.



Microsoft is demanding a jury trial and seeking permanent injunction to restrain and enjoin the defendants from infringement of Microsoft's registered trademarks and from directly or indirectly engaging in false advertising or promotions regarding the quality or security of Microsoft software.



The technology giant alleged in the lawsuit that the defendants used and misused the Microsoft name and its registered trademarks without authorisation in connection with the provision of phony technical support services.

The defendants used the Microsoft trademarks to enhance their credentials and confuse customers about their affiliation with Microsoft, the lawsuit alleges.



They then used their enhanced credibility to convince consumers that their personal computers are infected with malware in order to sell them unnecessary technical support and security services to clean their computers.

In some instances, the defendants actually created security issues for consumers by gaining access to their computers and stealing information stored on them, the lawsuit alleges.



""Many of these technical support companies are able to gain victims' trust by claiming they work for Microsoft, are a Microsoft Certified Partner or somehow affiliated with Microsoft,"" Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit Senior Attorney Courtney Gregoire said in a blog post



""In some instances, once the tech scammer gains remote access to a consumer's computer, they will use scare tactics ? telling the consumer that if they do not pay for support services they will lose all of their files, suffer a computer crash, or risk the leak of personal identifiable information,"" Gregoire said.



Since May 2014, Microsoft has received over 65,000 customer complaints regarding fraudulent tech support scams. It said tech support scammers do not discriminate and will go after anyone and not surprisingly senior citizens have been among the most vulnerable."

A lawyer for a man charged with sexually assaulting campers in Wyoming decades ago said Tuesday that the 94-year-old is near death in northern Michigan and may not make it to the weekend.

Quoting doctors, Anders Gillis said that William Bricker might live as long as two weeks but could die within 48 hours. Bricker, who has acute heart failure and dementia, was to be examined by a mental health professional in the Traverse City area to determine whether he understands that Wyoming wants to extradite him.

""His health is continuing to deteriorate,"" Gillis told The Associated Press. ""He's unable to place any weight on his feet. We're uncertain if he knows his own identity.""

Bricker is in hospice care and is ""mentally not there,"" Gillis said. ""The body's there, but he's cognitively gone.""

Bricker is accused of molesting children while he vounteered at the Teton Valley Ranch Camp in the 1960s and 1980s.

Gillis said the case ""is going to be a moot point. His doctor told us at most we can expect him to live another two weeks, but that it is highly probable that he will die within the next 48 hours.""

Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder have been trying to speed up his extradition to Wyoming to face charges of immoral acts with a child and immoral or indecent acts.

503|Judge voids verdict against S.F. Fire Department in exam case|"Judge voids verdict against S.F. Fire Department in exam case

In a major victory for San Francisco officials, a judge has tossed out a jury’s $3.7 million verdict that found that 15 city firefighters had suffered age discrimination during a lieutenant’s promotional exam process.

After more than a year of legal wrangling, Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo, who oversaw the case, voided the jury’s 2013 verdict late last month as unsubstantiated.

She separately granted the city’s motion for a new trial, citing the “possibility that an appellate body could disagree with the court’s conclusions.”

“The court does not take lightly its decision to invalidate the jury’s verdict,” Massullo said in her ruling. But she said “no substantial evidence exists to support” the jury’s key finding and subsequent 9-3 verdict.

The firefighters, three of whom have retired, accused the city of arbitrarily altering dozens of scores on the 2008 test and shredding scoring documents before firefighters could file a legal challenge.

They challenged the exam process as “fatally flawed” and skewed against firefighters who were over 40. The jury agreed.

The firefighters argued that the test's answer key contained faulty information and that scores had been changed by city officials in secret, without consulting the experts who prepared the key and outsiders who graded the exam.

745 took the test

The lieutenant's test, the first such exam in a decade, was taken by 745 firefighters, and less than a third of them passed.

Massullo said there was not enough evidence to support the jury’s finding of age discrimination. She said the scoring process had been marred by “minor errors” and that the city’s decision to destroy scoring documents was “misguided at best.” But she also concluded that the test was “overwhelmingly successful” in measuring job-related skills.

A finding that the test measured such skills, she said, was a “complete defense” against a discrimination claim.

“We know these kinds of decisions aren’t ones that courts take lightly, but we agree with the court’s conclusion that there were not facts to support the verdict,” said Matt Dorsey, spokesman for the city attorney.

Deputy City Attorney Ruth Bond told the jury that the test may not have been perfect, but that it was a “fair and objective process” that followed recognized standards and did the job of evaluating who would make a good lieutenant.

Murlene Randle, the firefighters’ attorney, said the judge had disregarded evidence that showed the test was flawed. She said the plaintiffs would appeal.

“It’s been an extremely long battle to try to get justice,” she said. “That’s why we had to take it to a jury. We had no recourse — we took it to the people and asked them to find justice for the plaintiffs, and they did.

'Struggling for justice’

“Now, what has happened is, all of that effort ... has been nullified by a stroke of a pen,” Randle said. “We are back where we started; we are struggling for justice. But we will not stop fighting.”

The Fire Department exams, including tests for lieutenant, battalion chief and assistant chief, have long been under legal attack from various firefighters as flawed. The lieutenant’s test was the first to go to trial, and the next trial is expected to be a race discrimination challenge to the battalion chief exam.

New Year's revelers jammed along Shanghai's historic riverfront stampeded about a half hour before midnight Wednesday, killing at least 36 people and injuring 47 others, Chinese media reported.

City officials said they had not yet determined what triggered the stampede about 11:35 p.m. in Chen Yi Square on the Bund, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported early Thursday. Many of the dead and injured were students.

A brief report on Xinhua's English-language site said celebrations ""went astray"" and ""a stampede resulted in casualties.""

A witness said people had scrambled to grab coupons resembling U.S. dollar bills that were being thrown from a third-floor window near the Bund.

It is the worst disaster in Shanghai in recent years.

The English-language Shanghai Daily noted that the stampede occurred near where a New Year countdown show was being held in the Bund Origin, a relatively enclosed area. Last week, officials canceled the scheduled 3-D laser show in an open area of the Bund because of crowd concerns.

Nearly 300,000 turned out for last year's laser show. Authorities relocated the New Year celebration to the smaller area and limited attendance to 2,000 invitation-only guests. The local government had said the show was relocated ""to improve traffic flow.""

The Bund — meaning embankment — runs along the Huangpu River and features buildings from the city's pre-revolution heyday, when it was a financial center for Asia.

Video from CCTV America, the U.S. version of state broadcaster China Central Television, showed piles of shoes amid the debris. Photographs showed bodies lying on the streets and attempts to revive victims.

Break the rules!

Esta noticia ha sido leída 16 veces





News day / Women need to take charge of their style and be practical with their choices when considering what to wear on New Year's Eve, Dass asserted. To mark her one year anniversary in the business, she unveiled a Holiday Glam collection under the CLD fashion label a few weeks ago.







Speaking about the collection, Dass said it embodies the strong woman who is in touch with her femininity and features flirty and practical pieces. Women who walk into the CLD boutique at Gallus Street, Woodbrook, looking for ideas could choose from that collection or select a modern, timeless dress from previous collections.







She said women are taking bolder choices with fashions and opting to wear separates to New Year's Eve parties.







""People would be expecting long flowing gowns in this new collection but women are being more practical these days so I didn't include any. What I have done is create a collection with structured, elegant pieces.""







""Even though it might be a shift dress, it's elegant and timeless. The pieces in-house from previous collections also include a lot of head turners to choose from,"" she added.







She utilised a lot of metallic, brocade, silk, lace and sequins for the new collection saying the fabrics up the glam factor, and for her, timeless colours, such as black, are always trending during this season. ""The rules don't apply anymore,"" designer Saleem Samuel said when contacted. He also stressed the importance of being practical with choices.







There is hardly any need for beads and sequins, Samuel said, especially if women are interested in wearing the outfit during the year.







""Women are interested in practical fashion, which is how it should be. There is no rule saying that a particular look is required for New Year's Eve,"" he said. Samuel's designs for the parties range from kaftan dresses to separates and even pencil skirts.







He suggested that women could shop around for separates such as flowing skirts and pair those with chic blouses. From his collection, he recommended a long flowing shirt and bustier top which creates the illusion of a dress when paired. The high-waist pencil skirts paired with sheer blouses are also trending according to him. His collection offers a range of ideas as to how a woman could wear a pencil skirt to a New Year's Eve party.







As it relates to colour, Samuel said white is in. ""There is a shift towards lighter colours: pastels are really popular now, but white is the colour that is bringing energy this season and it creates an angelic look.""







Samuel added that no matter what a woman wears, the best accessory is confidence. ""You could dress the outfits up but nothing beats wearing confidence."" Samuel's boutique is located at the corner of Gordon and Henry Streets, Port-of-Spain.







Designer, Tyrone Nelson who manages EDI Designs, an urban brand, operating out of the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago also said women are opting for lighter colours this season and are going for ""an angelic look.""







""White is definitely wearing a lot and women are going for that sophisticated look so the choices include flowing fabrics. But we have also been styling women who are interested in sexy glam,"" Nelson said.







The idea is to stand out and leave a lasting impression at the parties, according to Nelson. Therefore, he focused on creating unique pieces this holiday season.







When accessorising he said to keep things simple. ""Simple earrings and necklaces are fine but some women could opt for chunky depending on the statement the outfit is making."" Nelson's showroom is located at Bell Bird Avenue, Malabar, Arima.

506|Colombian city to manufacture parts for Black Hawk helicopters|"Dosquebradas, Colombia, Dec 31 (EFE).- Manufacturers in Dosquebradas, a city in eastern Colombia, are producing parts and spare parts for military aircraft, including the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, competing in a market traditionally dominated by U.S. and European contractors.

Three years ago, the Dosquebradas Chamber of Commerce created an aeronautics cluster that now has contracts with the Colombian air force and is looking to expand into the civilian aviation market.

With some 200,000 residents, Dosquebradas is the second-largest city in Risaralda province, and ""it has a strong technological capacity to produce parts for aircraft,"" John Jaime Jimenez, chairman of the chamber, told Colombia.inn, an Efe-operated news agency.

Some 14 companies in the region identified potential demand and began developing parts for Black Hawk helicopters and airplanes, such as the Kfir and Cessna Caravan.

Local industries already manufacture 34 of the 17,000 pieces in the Black Hawk military helicopter, including parts for the tail rotor and brakes, fuel tanks, valves and special lids.

""We have produced small metal parts, safety seals, landing gear filters and assorted special pieces in titanium and aluminum,"" Jimenez said, adding that sometimes aircraft were grounded for lack of replacement parts.

The air force has 32 U.S.-made Black Hawks, called the Arpia in Colombia, while the army has about 70 and the National Police operates seven of the helicopters.

Colombia's air force has 24 Israeli-made Kfir fighter-bombers.

Colombia imports about 4 trillion pesos ($1.67 billion) of aircraft parts each year, and the Dosquebradas Chamber of Commerce sees an opportunity to boost Risaralda's economy.

The chamber currently works with 30 additional companies developing and designing parts.

""With this aeronautical cluster, Colombia proves it has the potential, the capability, the expertise, the knowledge, the machines and a series of supplies enabling us to be a country offering those parts and replacements,"" Jimenez said.

Aircraft parts made in Risaralda are not exported yet, but the Colombian companies are exploring markets and preparing for the certification process.

The goal is that by 2020-2025 the region can become the main parts supplier for the Colombian air force.

That would double the 6,500 jobs currently generated by the metal and mechanics sector, which accounts for 8 percent of the province's gross domestic product and the second most valued exports after coffee."
507|The Electrical Training Alliance and NECA-IBEW Team Opens New Educational Training Facility|"Electrical Training Alliance's New Apprenticeship Training Facility in Knoxville, TN We know that our labor is going to be our highest cost...if we're going to do our customers any justice, it's going to be to go to a job site...and provide them with the most knowledgeable guys.

In its ongoing commitment to providing cutting-edge training and continuing education for workers in the electrical design and construction industry, the Electrical Training Alliance has opened a new training center in Knoxville, TN. The Electrical Training Alliance is the training and educational arm of the National Electrical Contractors Association and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (NECA-IBEW).

The new Electrician Training Academy at Knoxville (ETAK) is one of nearly 300 such electrical training centers located across the United States. These centers which are funded by NECA-IBEW member contributions provide apprenticeships as well as opportunities for electricians to upgrade their skills. This annual funding comes to approximately $180 million – nearly twice the Federal budget for similar programs.

Dominic Giarratano, who hosts the web-based series Electric TV, says, “Apprenticeship programs that employ work-based learning models...are considered by the U.S. Department of Labor to be on the cutting edge [of] innovation.”

The curriculum used in these electrical training programs and their development are based on national standards established by NECA-IBEW, but are implemented on the local level. These efforts require the combined efforts of management as well as labor, which is a large part of why NECA-IBEW exists.

“In order for this country's economy to continue to grow and thrive in a competitive global environment, we need the right people with the right skills,” Giarratano adds.

Centers similar to the new Knoxville Training Center have an excellent record of producing expert workers and engineers in the constantly changing and often challenging field of electrical design and construction.

Justin Wojciechowski, a 4th-year apprentice, accurately sums it up, saying, “We know that our labor is going to be our highest cost...if we're going to do our customers any justice, it's going to be to go to a job site...and provide them with the most knowledgeable guys.”

508|Police: 2-year-old accidentally kills his mom in Idaho Walmart|"A relative of the woman who was accidentally shot and killed by her 2-year-old son at an Idaho Wal-Mart says she was a ""loving mother.""

The Kootenai County sheriff's department has identified the victim as 29-year-old Veronica J. Rutledge, of Blackfoot, Idaho.

Authorities say she was shopping Tuesday morning with her son when the boy reached into her purse and grabbed a small-caliber handgun, which discharged.

The victim's father-in-law, Terry Rutledge, says the woman was ""taken much too soon.""

The shooting occurred in the Wal-Mart in Hayden, Idaho, a town about 40 miles northeast of Spokane, Washington.

509|New Year's stampede in Shanghai leaves dozens dead|"SHANGHAI -- People unable to contact friends and relatives streamed into hospitals Thursday, anxious for information after a stampede during New Year's celebrations in Shanghai's historic waterfront area killed 36 people in the worst disaster to hit one of China's showcase cities in recent years.

The Shanghai government said 47 others received hospital treatment, including 13 who were seriously injured, after the chaos about a half-hour before midnight. Seven of the injured people had left hospitals by Thursday afternoon.

The Shanghai government information office said one Taiwanese was among the dead, and two Taiwanese and one Malaysian were among the injured.

The deaths and injuries occurred at Chen Yi Square in Shanghai's popular riverfront Bund area, an avenue lined with art deco buildings from the 1920s and 1930s when Shanghai was home to international banks and trading houses. The area is often jammed with people during major events.

At one of the hospitals where the injured were being treated, police brought out photos of unidentified dead victims, causing dozens of waiting relatives to crowd around. Not everyone could see, and young women who looked at the photos broke into tears when they recognized someone.

A saleswoman in her 20s, who declined to give her name, said she had been celebrating with three friends. ""I heard people screaming, someone fell, people shouted 'don't rush,'"" she said. ""There were so many people and I couldn't stand properly."" She added that she still could not contact one of her friends.

The official Xinhua News Agency quoted a woman with the surname Yin who was caught with her 12-year-old son in the middle of crowds of people pushing to go up and down steps leading from the square.

""Then people started to fall down, row by row,"" Yin said. When her son was finally brought to safety, he had shoe prints over his clothes, ""his forehead was bruised, he had two deep creased scars on his neck, and his mouth and nose were bleeding,"" she said.

Xia Shujie, vice president of Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital, told reporters that some of the victims had been suffocated.

At the hospital, which was guarded by police, a man who would give only his surname, Li, said he had identified his wife's cousin among the dead.

Relatives desperately seeking information earlier tried to push past hospital guards, who used a bench to hold them back. Police later allowed family members into the hospital.

CCTV America, the U.S. version of state broadcaster China Central Television, posted a video of Shanghai streets after the stampede showing piles of discarded shoes amid the debris.

One photo from the scene shared by Xinhua showed at least one person doing chest compressions on a shirtless man while several other people lay on the ground nearby, amid debris. Another photo showed the area ringed by police.

On Thursday morning, dozens of police officers were in the area and tourists continued to wander by the square, a small patch of grass dominated by a statue of Chen Yi, the city's first Communist mayor.

Steps lead down from the square to a road across from several buildings.

""We were down the stairs and wanted to move up and those who were upstairs wanted to move down, so we were pushed down by the people coming from upstairs,"" an injured man told Shanghai TV. ""All those trying to move up fell down on the stairs.""

Xinhua quoted witness Wu Tao as saying some people had scrambled for coupons that looked like dollar bills bearing the name of a bar that were being thrown out of a third-floor window. But police dismissed speculation that the coupons had triggered the stampede, saying they were thrown after the tragedy.

The cause of the stampede was still under investigation.

Last week, the English-language Shanghai Daily reported that the annual New Year's Eve countdown on the Bund that normally attracts about 300,000 people had been canceled, apparently because of crowd control issues. The report said a ""toned-down"" version of the event would be held instead but that it would not be open to the public.

The stampede appeared to be near that area. The city apparently did not expect that so many people would assemble there and was not adequately prepared."
510|Lucky you: Welcome 2015 with pork & sauerkraut in slow-cooker|"It is said that eating pork on New Year's Day brings luck.

I couldn't agree more. Digging into a plate of pork and sauerkraut makes me feel lucky indeed.

I used to hate sauerkraut, to be honest. I wondered why anyone would eat fermented cabbage on purpose.

Well, with this recipe, I found myself digging in. I don't know if I've changed, or if the recipe is just that good, but I'll tell you, this is what I want to eat every New Year's Day forever.

Five things I learned:

1. The recipe calls for ""boneless country pork spareribs."" I am stupefied by meat cuts and often stand helplessly at the meat case trying to find a label that resembles what a recipe requires.

Here's some background: ""Country spareribs"" aren't really ribs. (Very helpful. Not. )

What are commonly called ""country-style ribs"" are cut from the front end of the baby back ribs near the shoulder (By the way, ""baby back ribs"" are not cut from baby pigs, but from the narrower end of the rib cage. See? This isn't confusing at all.)

At any rate, country-style ribs won't contain much bone to start with. Any bones you find are small pieces of the shoulder blade, not the ribs.

2. While I tried to find them ""boneless,"" the ones I brought home did indeed include small parts of the shoulder blade. I just cut each ""rib"" of the meat into three 3-inch pieces and left the bone intact in the third piece, thinking it would add flavor. That was fine. It was easy to eat meat off the bone, like you would, well, a rib.

If you can't find them boneless, try to buy more than 2 pounds to get the same amount of meat. But don't sweat it. If the packages all say 2 pounds, that will work.

In general, country-style ""ribs"" should not be cooked like ribs. They have more meat and less fat than regular ribs and respond best to long, slow cooking.

3. The recipe also called for juniper berries. What the heck? Never heard of them. I trekked through Wegmans for eons before asking for help. Two very nice employees ran all over the store for me, at last discovering a small box of them in a holiday foods display.

The whole juniper berries you find in the store are usually sold dried and look like tiny wild blueberries. They're not technically berries, but are instead the tightly wrapped seed cones produced by juniper bushes -- think pine cones. Their typical use is to tame the musty flavor of game meat and add tartness to Germanic dishes, such as pork and sauerkraut.

This might be why I liked the sauerkraut this time around. It had a bright, lively flavor I'd not tasted before.

4. For this recipe, you only need five juniper berries to wrap in a pouch of cheesecloth with peppercorns. You remove the pouch before serving.

Of course, now I have a whole box of these things. What do I do with them?

The good news is they keep well in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two years. I've also read you can use them in chili and marinades.

5. If you don't want to bother with them, you can certainly make this recipe without juniper berries. Substitutions include a bay leaf, sprig of rosemary or even a spot of gin. (Gin is made from immature juniper berries.)

Many recipes that call for juniper berries require them to be crushed fine and stirred into a dish, like ground ginger or cloves. They're sold whole, though, because they lose flavor quickly once they're opened.

P.S. No matter what you're eating, I wish you a happy -- and lucky -- new year, filled with fantastic new kitchen discoveries. Thanks for reading.

511|Five States propose N908.35b budgets for 2015|"•A’Ibom: N426b; Benue: N98.54b; Borno: N175b; Zamfara: N92.8b; Ebonyi: N80.017b

By Idongesit Ashameri (Uyo), Tor Vande-Acka (Makurdi), Uka Felix (Abakaliki) and Sunny Nwankwo (Maiduguri)

Five states on Tuesday presented budget proposals for 2015 fiscal year estimated at N908.35 billion to their various houses of assembly with Akwa Ibom leading the pack with N462 billion.

Other proposals are Borno, N175 billion; Benue N98.54 billion; Zamfara, N92.80 billion; and Ebonyi, N80.02 billion.

Presenting the budget estimate to the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly on Tuesday, the state Governor, Godswill Akpabio, said the budget which seeks to build on successes and achievements so far recorded intends to make the people happier.

Of the N462 estimated, N253 billion is budgeted for capital expenditure, N94.74 billion earmarked for recurrent expenditure, while N114.26 is intended for consolidated revenue fund charges. The estimates were based on current price of crude.

Akpabio said the 2015 budget estimate recorded a short fall of N36 billion from the 2014 budget due to short fall of about 44 per cent in the state’s allocation.

To succeed in securing adequate funds to implement the budget, however, the Governor disclosed a strategy to build a strong fiscal regime through expansion of revenue base and elimination of wastages in the system.

Outlining expected sources of revenue, the governor explained that N33.06 billion is expected from Internally Generated Revenue; Statutory allocation, N50 billion; Derivation fund, N271.11 billion; retained revenue from parastatals, N1.83 billion; value added tax, N15 billion; SURE-P, N23 billion; totalling N394.00 billion.

Justifying previous budgets in the state, Akpabio enumerated achievements of his administration especially in the areas of education and infrastructural development.

Benue State Governor, Gabriel Suswam, said the budget of N98,545,593,853 billion was 11.63 per cent lower than that of 2014.

While the recurrent expenditure is expected to gulp over N52.8 billion, capital expenditure will take over N45.2 billion which will be allocated to ongoing projects in the state.

Suswam who made the presentation at the Assembly complex in Makurdi said the budget is expected to consolidate on the achievements of the past seven years.

In an emotional laden speech, Suswam said the budget was the last of the administration and appealed to the legislature to give the budget expeditious action.

Reeling out the budget performance for 2014, the governor said about N25 billion was expended on personnel costs; over N5 billion on overhead cost, representing about 32 per cent of the budget; over N3 billion for pensions as well as N3 billion spent on capital expenditure, translating to about 16 per cent of the budget.

Suswam noted that the remaining months (January to May, 2015) were more crucial in view of the elections, and appealed to contestants in any form of election to embrace the outcome of such elections.

Speaker of the Assembly, Terhile Ayua, then urged Suswam to continue to maintain peace and work with the assembly and judiciary to ensure good governance in the state.

Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno presenting budget proposal of N175 billion said the proposal tagged “Budget of Fulfilment” comprised N62 billion recurrent and N113 billion capital expenditures.

He explained that the budget would be financed through N98 billion Statutory Allocation, N39 billion Internally Generated Revenue and N38 billion Capital Receipts.

Shettima said that the budget was aimed at completing all projects and introducing viable ones that would have positive impact on the lives of the citizenry.

The budget breakdown shows the Ministry of Works getting the highest allocation of N23 billion; Ministry of Health, N17 billion, and Ministry of Education, N14 billion.

Others are Ministry of Higher Education, N12 billion, and the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), N11 billion.

Government also proposed a budget of over N92.8 billion for the 2015 fiscal year as against the over N114.8 billion budgeted for 2014.

The budget proposal was presented to the state House of Assembly on Tuesday in Gusau in a special session presided over by the Speaker, Sunusi Rikiji.

In Zamfara State, Governor Abdulaziz Yari presenting the proposal of N92.80 billion, said the decrease of about 19 per cent in the 2015 proposed budget was due to the current economic challenges facing the country.

Yari said the estimates, tagged a budget of consolidation, would focus more on completion of ongoing projects by the current administration and would also give more emphasis on health, water resources and social sectors.

The governor said that N50 billion and N42.8 billion were for recurrent and capital expenditures respectively.

Yari restated the state government’s commitment to continue to execute the projects that would provide the needed social infrastructure to the people of the state.

He extolled the existing cordial relationship between the state government and the legislature.

He also commended the state lawmakers for the support, co-operation, and understanding given to the executive and judicial arms of government.

Responding, the Speaker, Rikiji, promised speedy passage of the budget to sustain the laudable programmes and policies of the state government.

Ebonyi State Governor, Martin Elechi, presenting the budget estimate of N80,017,929,870 billion said the recurrent expenditure for the period would gulp N39,991,977,780 representing 47.48 per cent while the capital expenditure stands at N42,025,952,090, representing 52.52 per cent of the total budget.

Elechi noted that the Economic sector received N24,022,394,920, taking the largest chunk of the capital provision while in social sector, education sub-sector got N2,077,015,000 and Health sector, N2,147,100,000.

The governor noted that the 2015 budget was tagged “Budget of Transition of Fulfilment” just as he said the N16.5 billion bond collected by the state government in 2010 was never intended to complete the projects embarked upon by the government and urged the members of the House to approve the budget as it would help the government to complete its projects.

A seven-man committee was set up by the Speaker, Chukwuma Nwazunku, to look into the budget just as he assured the governor of the speedy passage for the interest of the people of the state."

Cod Roe Spaghetti. (Renee Comet for The Washington Post; styling by Bonnie S. Benwick)

In an international smackdown of salty-creamy pastas, I’d give the Japanese contender the edge over Italy’s beloved spaghetti carbonara. A tidy bowl of cod roe spaghetti is food that satisfies late at night, say, after an evening of visiting your favorite bartenders. It offers crunch, color and a certain aesthetic, sauced in pale pink and set off by glistening fish roe, shredded nori and fragrant lemon zest.

Chef Katsuya Fukushima’s kitchen crew at Daikaya Izakaya in Chinatown plates with panache, using special tongs to twirl just-dressed angel-hair pasta into egg-roll-size cylinders. Their technique is achievable, but the spaghetti tastes just as good no matter what shape it’s in.

514|2-year-old shoots & kills mom in store|"× 2-year-old shoots & kills mom in store

HAYDEN, Ohio. — A 2-year-old boy accidentally shot and killed his mother after he reached into her purse at a northern Idaho Walmart and her concealed gun fired, authorities said Tuesday.

Veronica J. Rutledge, 29, was shopping with her son and three other children, Kootenai County sheriff’s spokesman Stu Miller said. Rutledge was from Blackfoot in southeastern Idaho, and her family had come to the area to visit relatives.

She had a concealed weapons permit. Miller said the young boy was left in a shopping cart, reached into his mother’s purse and grabbed a small-caliber handgun, which discharged one time.

Deputies who responded to the Walmart found Rutledge dead, the sheriff’s office said.

“It appears to be a pretty tragic accident,” Miller said.

The victim’s father-in-law, Terry Rutledge, told The Associated Press that Veronica Rutledge “was a beautiful, young, loving mother.”

“She was not the least bit irresponsible,” Terry Rutledge said. “She was taken much too soon.”

The woman’s husband was not in the store when the shooting happened at about 10:20 a.m.

Miller said the man arrived shortly after the shooting. All the children were taken to a relative’s house.

The shooting occurred in the Walmart in Hayden, Idaho, a town about 40 miles northeast of Spokane, Washington.

Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said in a statement the shooting was a “very sad and tragic accident.”

“We are working closely with the local sheriff’s department while they investigate what happened,” Buchanan said.

There do not appear to be reliable national statistics about the number of accidental fatalities involving children handling guns.

In neighboring Washington state, a 3-year-old boy was seriously injured in November when he accidentally shot himself in the face in a home in Lake Stevens, about 30 miles north of Seattle.

In April, a 2-year-old boy apparently shot and killed his 11-year-old sister while they and their siblings played with a gun inside a Philadelphia home. Authorities said the gun was believed to have been brought into the home by the mother’s boyfriend.

Hayden is a town of about 9,000 people just north of Coeur d’Alene, in Idaho’s northern panhandle.

Idaho lawmakers passed legislation earlier this year allowing concealed weapons on the state’s public college and university campuses.

Despite facing opposition from all eight of the state’s university college presidents, lawmakers sided with gun rights advocates who said the law would better uphold the Second Amendment.

Under the law, gun holders are barred from bringing their weapons into dormitories or buildings that hold more than 1,000 people, such as stadiums or concert halls.

517|New Hampshire Husband Allegedly Planned Double Suicide at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital|"For one husband, the pain of his wife living on a respirator was too much. So much so, he penned a final Facebook post in a plan to kill his wife, and then himself at a local New Hampshire hospital. Police have not confirmed the labeled “murder-suicide” is the same as the posted “double suicide” on the social media wall of New Hampshire resident, Mark A. Lavoie. The comments left on the daunting Facebook post indicates it is linked to the same hospital named by officials where the shooting took place.

Not much is being shared by hospital officials at this time, as police try to investigate the complete scene and timeline of events, including the Facebook post.

Police were called to the Critical Care Unit at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital around 6 a.m after reports of shots fired. When they arrived, they found a husband and his wife dead in a private hospital room. Assistant Attorney General, Jay McCormack advised the case is pending investigation and did not release information as to why the wife was hospitalized, nor the identities of the deceased.

A relative told the AP that Lavoie was her brother, and he shot his wife Katherine and himself “out of love.” In the Facebook post by the husband, he notes his wife suffered from bi-polar demons since her childhood, and regrets a 911 call he made. Read the full entry below:

Lavoie’s Facebook page is filled with the average postings of sports, sharing pet pictures and a special post on November 10, honoring his father who was a military vet. Nothing alludes to the final post his friends and family witnessed.

The horror of their responses reached out to Lavoie, asking him to reach out and call them. Two hours after the post, a friend updates the concerned friends, advising, “I don’t usually get involved with Facebook posts but people need answers. I just found out mark shot Kathy and the turned the gun on himself. My heart goes out to there [sic] families and I’m sorry I don’t have anymore information right now.”

Another friend posted a message later in the day saying, “Mark & Kathy ……. NEVER have I seen such a demonstration of the kind of love we all strive for, ….. to lay down one’s life for one’s friend (in this case, the love of your life). You’ve always had a good heart, and although you will both be missed, anyone who knows you will respect your deep love. So, rest in peace un [sic] heaven …. no worries, only peace & happiness ….. together.”"
518|Afghan Mountain Hamlet a Proving Ground for Army|"In this Dec. 24, 2014 photo, Afghan National Army soldiers stand guard near their vehicle during an ongoing operation in the Dangam district of Kunar province, Afghanistan. (AP Photo)

DANGAM, Afghanistan — The smoke from mortar and rocket attacks rises from the mountains of Dangam in the remote eastern border region of Afghanistan as Talban insurgents battle government forces in a bid to establish a permanent presence now that the American soldiers who led the fight here for more than a decade have left.

Heavy fighting has been raging for almost three weeks, with wave after wave of Taliban militants assaulting this picturesque but poverty-stricken district of Kunar province just four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the border with Pakistan, officials and residents said.

The U.S.-led international effort to rid Afghanistan of the Taliban officially shifts from a combat to a training band support mission Wednesday, with Afghan forces assuming full responsibility for security nationwide on New Year's Day. A residual force of 10,800 Americans and almost 3,000 NATO soldiers will remain, under the banner of a new mission called Resolute Support.

Over the last 18 months, U.S. and NATO forces have been closing their bases across the country, taking their battlefield prowess, air support and medical evacuation assets with them.

The war is meanwhile creeping into urban and residential areas, putting ordinary people at greater risk. Civilian casualties look set to hit 10,000 in 2014, the highest yearly total of dead and wounded since the U.N. began keeping records in 2008. More than 75 percent of the deaths and injuries are caused by Taliban attacks, according to the U.N.

There are few places where Afghan forces have been tested as ferociously as in Dangam, a forested valley where life has changed little for centuries.

The fighting began when local residents decided they had had enough of the Taliban, who had set up a ""shadow"" administration and were attempting to take control of the valley, according to Gen. Mohammad Zaman Waziri, Afghan army corps commander for eastern Afghanistan.

The Afghan army came to help, he said, and fighting has been going on ever since.

Up to 550 families have been forced from their homes, and more than 40 houses have been destroyed, Kunar governor Sheja-ul Mulk Jalala said. Tribal elder Haji Muzamel said another 800 families have been pinned down by the fighting.

""The terrorists have very important goals in Dangam, such as establishing permanent bases or transferring their bases from the other side of the border, crushing the local people's uprising and of course creating problems for Afghan security forces,"" said Haseb Sediqi, spokesman for the National Security Directorate intelligence agency.

Officials said that since early December more than 1,000 heavily armed insurgents have turned up here, including members of the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the group responsible for the attacks on the Indian city of Mumbai in 2008 in which more than 160 people were killed.

The TTP said it was behind the attack this month on a school in Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, in which more than 140 people were killed, most of them children. It is not unusual for Pakistani fighters — usually referred to by Afghan officials as simply ""foreigners"" — to fight alongside the Afghan Taliban.

The Peshawar attack was widely seen as a watershed moment that could help dissipate the long-held mistrust between the neighboring nations as they recognize the need to deal with insurgent groups on both sides of the border.

In recent weeks, Afghan, Pakistani and coalition military leaders have shuttled back and forth between Kabul and Islamabad to discuss cooperation at all levels, including military and intelligence, officials have said. The counter-terrorism component of the Americans' remit in Afghanistan, expanded by President Barack Obama, will allow U.S. troops to engage in operations against the Taliban, as well as al-Qaeda, and provide the Afghans with battlefield and air support.

In Dangam, officials said the international coalition has not yet been called upon to help repel the Taliban attacks.

Sartaj Aziz, a senior adviser to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, praised the Afghan efforts in Kunar, telling local television: ""It was a good thing on the part of (the) Afghan government and will help bring peace to the nation.""

Afghanistan and Pakistan share a 2,250-kilometer (1,400-mile) border and militants from both sides routinely launch cross-border attacks. This has long strained relations, with the two countries accusing one another of offering safe haven to terrorists.

But Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who took office in September, has said he will never allow militants to enjoy safe haven in Afghanistan. And Pakistan's Sharif has said the days of distinguishing between ""good"" and ""bad"" insurgents are over. Analysts have long accused Pakistan of battling its own insurgents while tolerating or even working with the Afghan Taliban to destabilize its neighbor in order to prevent regional rival India from expanding its influence in South Asia.

The fighting in Dangam will test those pledges, and the mettle of Afghanistan's troops. Thus far they are holding the line, having lost just six soldiers in three weeks of fighting, with another 20 wounded, Waziri said. But the columns of gray smoke and the explosions echoing across the forbidding hills indicate the battle is far from over.

519|36 killed, 47 injured in Shanghai stampede|"People unable to contact friends and relatives streamed into hospitals Thursday, anxious for information after a stampede during New Year's celebrations in Shanghai's historic waterfront area killed 36 people in the worst disaster to hit one of China's showcase cities in recent years.

People unable to contact friends and relatives streamed into hospitals Thursday, anxious for information after a stampede during New Year’s celebrations in Shanghai’s historic waterfront area killed 36 people in the worst disaster to hit one of China’s showcase cities in recent years.

The Shanghai government said 47 others received hospital treatment, including 13 who were seriously injured, after the chaos about a half-hour before midnight. Seven of the injured people had left hospitals by Thursday afternoon.

The Shanghai government information office said one Taiwanese was among the dead, and two Taiwanese and one Malaysian were among the injured.

The deaths and injuries occurred at Chen Yi Square in Shanghai’s popular riverfront Bund area, an avenue lined with art deco buildings from the 1920s and 1930s when Shanghai was home to international banks and trading houses. The area is often jammed with people during major events.

At one of the hospitals where the injured were being treated, police brought out photos of unidentified dead victims, causing dozens of waiting relatives to crowd around. Not everyone could see, and young women who looked at the photos broke into tears when they recognized someone.

A saleswoman in her 20s, who declined to give her name, said she had been celebrating with three friends. “I heard people screaming, someone fell, people shouted ‘don’t rush,'” she said. “There were so many people and I couldn’t stand properly.” She added that she still could not contact one of her friends.

The official Xinhua News Agency quoted a woman with the surname Yin who was caught with her 12-year-old son in the middle of crowds of people pushing to go up and down steps leading from the square.

“Then people started to fall down, row by row,” Yin said. When her son was finally brought to safety, he had shoe prints over his clothes, “his forehead was bruised, he had two deep creased scars on his neck, and his mouth and nose were bleeding,” she said.

Xia Shujie, vice president of Shanghai No. 1 People’s Hospital, told reporters that some of the victims had been suffocated.

At the hospital, which was guarded by police, a man who would give only his surname, Li, said he had identified the body of his wife’s cousin among the dead.

Relatives desperately seeking information earlier tried to push past hospital guards, who used a bench to hold them back. Police later allowed family members into the hospital.

CCTV America, the U.S. version of state broadcaster China Central Television, posted a video of Shanghai streets after the stampede showing piles of discarded shoes amid the debris.

One photo from the scene shared by Xinhua showed at least one person doing chest compressions on a shirtless man while several other people lay on the ground nearby, amid debris. Another photo showed the area ringed by police.

On Thursday morning, dozens of police officers were in the area and tourists continued to wander by the square, a small patch of grass dominated by a statue of Chen Yi, the city’s first Communist mayor.

Steps lead down from the square to a road across from several buildings.

“We were down the stairs and wanted to move up and those who were upstairs wanted to move down, so we were pushed down by the people coming from upstairs,” an injured man told Shanghai TV. “All those trying to move up fell down on the stairs.”

Xinhua quoted witness Wu Tao as saying some people had scrambled for coupons that looked like dollar bills bearing the name of a bar that were being thrown out of a third-floor window. It said the cause of the stampede was still under investigation.

Last week, the English-language Shanghai Daily reported that the annual New Year’s Eve countdown on the Bund that normally attracts about 300,000 people had been canceled, apparently because of crowd control issues. The report said a “toned-down” version of the event would be held instead but that it would not be open to the public.

The stampede appeared to be near that area.

520|Defense Attorneys Challenge Arrest of Mumbai Attacks Suspect|"Defense Attorneys Challenge Arrest of Mumbai Attacks Suspect

by Ayaz Gul December 31, 2014

Defense attorneys in Pakistan have alleged the government rearrested the suspected leader of the 2008 Mumbai attacks on ""fake"" charges to appease India. Authorities in Pakistan appear to have a problem because the release of the man could further raise tensions with India and attempting to influence the judiciary could draw massive criticism at home.

The accused, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, is one of seven suspects being tried in Pakistan on charges of planning the Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people.



The men were arrested shortly after the deadly 2008 militant raid in the Indian commercial capital, and New Delhi has since been demanding Islamabad prosecute and punish them.

However, earlier this month the anti-terrorism court trying the suspects ordered Lakhvi be released on bail, citing a ""lack of evidence"" and ""flaws in the prosecution's case. The ruling outraged India but tensions eased after Pakistani authorities ordered Lakhvi to remain in custody under a public order law.

Defense attorneys successfully contested the detention order in a higher court that ruled on Monday that the suspected militant leader could be freed on bail. But hours after Lakhvi won the appeal, police rearrested him on new kidnapping charges.

Defense lawyer Rizwan Abbasi said he has launched new challenges against what he criticized as ""fake"" charges and the ""ghost"" complainant. Abassi said his client has been in jail for more than six years so how could someone in custody have kidnapped anybody.

""It is alleged against my client that he has abducted one person who is in custody since more than six-and-a-half year. How is it possible that a person who was in jail since last six years he can retain someone in his custody? From the face of it this allegation is ridiculous,"" he said.

Attorney Abbasi said that Pakistani authorities were reluctant to release his client because they did not want to upset India.

""It is very clear that on Indian pressure my client has been put in custody just to deprive him from the right of liberty,"" he said.

India summoned the Pakistani envoy in New Delhi to the foreign ministry to protest Monday's first ruling that appeared to free Lakhvi.

He is expected to appear before the court on Thursday when a report detailing the police investigation into the kidnapping charges is submitted.

The suspects on trial in Pakistan are allegedly members of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba that India accuses of being behind the 2008 Mumbai carnage.

The latest 'back and forth' in the high profile case comes as relations between Pakistan and India have plunged to new lows in the wake of recent border clashes. However, Pakistani officials maintain the country's judiciary is independent and the government cannot interfere in the legal proceedings.

Both the rival countries reported fresh clashes on Wednesday along the disputed border in Kashmir. The cross-border firing is said to have killed two Pakistani soldiers and an India soldier. It is unclear who initiated the fire."

522|PM Modi assures Nirbhaya's parents about ensuring safety, security of women|"PM Modi assures Nirbhaya's parents about ensuring safety, security of women

Cincinnati Sun (ANI) Thursday 1st January, 2015

The parents of 'Nirbhaya' called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi here today.

The Prime Minister condoled their loss and assured them that the Union Government would do its utmost for the safety and security of women.

The Prime Minister also appreciated the efforts of Nirbhaya's mother, who now runs the Nirbhaya Jyoti Trust for the security and welfare of women.

On December 16, 2012, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was brutally gang-raped by six men, including a juvenile, in a moving bus. The woman later succumbed to her injuries at a Singapore hospital, where she had been airlifted for specialised treatment.

The case, which branded New Delhi as the 'rape capital' of the country, pushed authorities to enact tougher laws, including allowing for death sentences to be handed down to repeat rape offenders.

The four adults accused in the case were awarded the death penalty on September 13, 2013, with the Delhi High Court upholding the death penalty in March 2014.

The case is currently with the Supreme Court after the convicts appealed against the judgement. (ANI)"

President thanked Russians for defending national interests in what he described as an historic year that saw Crimea annexed from Ukraine and the ""best ever"" Winter Olympic Games.



In a New Year's Eve message usually aired at midnight, which has already been shown to Russians in the Far East, Putin said that love for the motherland was what ensured that the Crimean peninsula joined in March after a controversial referendum.



""It fully revealed itself in the brotherly support of the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol when they firmly decided to go back home,"" Putin said.



""This event will forever remain a most important milestone in our history.""



Putin admitted earlier this year that Russian soldiers were deployed in Crimea during the March referendum, when residents voted to break away from Ukraine and join Russia.



These events fuelled Western sanctions against Moscow and were followed by the ongoing bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine.



""As we review the passing year, I would like to sincerely thank you for unity and solidarity, for the deep feelings of truth, honour, justice and responsibility for the fate of your country, for the unfaltering readiness to defend Russia's interests,"" Putin said.



He added that Russia staged the ""best Winter Games in history"" in Sochi, where the Olympic dream ""came true"" in February and Russian athletes took first place.



Putin made no mention of the unfolding economic crisis that is almost sure to sink Russia into recession in 2015, but said that the new year will ""depend on each one of us,"" and their committment to Russia."

526|A First-Hand Call To Action In Haiti|"SIOUX FALLS, SD -

In 2010, Haiti was struck by magnitude 7.0 earthquake. Recovery back to pre-earthquake conditions has been slow for the Caribbean country.

After a week in Haiti, Vince Lubben was inspired to challenge his business to sponsor children in Haiti. In total, his team sponsored 53 kids, and Wireless World matched that for a total of 103 sponsored children.

""Here are the kids walking on the trail carrying water and laughing and having a good time,"" Wireless World co-owner Vince Lubben said.

For Lubben, pictures not only brings back a handful of memories but also serves as reminder to be grateful.

""In American, God has given us more than we need or deserve,"" Lubben said.

Back in November, Lubben saw first-hand what life is like in Haiti when he volunteered there for a week.

""I was thankful for water to drink and I was even thankful for an outhouse. Because some of these folks don't even have an outhouse and it's just perspective that's life changing and really neat,"" Lubben said.

But his eagerness to help and give back doesn't stop there.

""$100 can send a kid in Haiti to school for the whole year. With that, they would get a uniform because in Haiti you need a uniform to go to school and you get de-wormed for only $100 a year."" Lubben said.

He called on his team members to inspire them to pay it forward, the response surpassed his expectations.

""I put out a challenge to our team at wireless world and I am so proud of them because they stepped up and sponsored 53 kids in Haiti. Wireless world matched each one of those and so all together we sponsored 106 kids,"" Lubben said.

""Just through a sponsorship like Vince and his team did you make a huge impact,"" U.S. Director of Mission Haiti Jim Calkhoven said. ""Many people know that Haiti was so devastated by the earthquake. It's so poverty stricken and for us to be able to go there in our mountain villages and offer hope.""

""Being there it was very neat to see that the money that we give makes a direct impact on a child's life,"" Lubben said.

527|Traffic cameras aren't ideal for every municipality|"WASHINGTON -- Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, a subsidiary of The Mosaic Company, has reached around $2 billion settlements with federal and state environmental agencies to resolve charges of mismanagement of onsite waste materials at its fertilizer manufacturing facilities in Florida and Louisiana.



Announcing the settlements, which are subject to court approval, the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Thursday said Mosaic Fertilizer has committed to ensure the proper treatment, storage and disposal of an estimated 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste at six Mosaic facilities in Florida and two in Louisiana.



The settlement resolves a series of alleged violations by Mosaic of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which provides universal guidelines for how hazardous waste must be stored, handled and disposed.



The 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste addressed in this case is the largest ever covered by a federal or state RCRA settlement and will ensure that wastewater at Mosaic's facilities is properly managed and does not pose a threat to groundwater resources.



At Mosaic's eight facilities in Florida and Louisiana, hazardous waste from fertilizer production is currently stored in large piles, tanks, ditches and ponds. The piles are as high as 500 feet and cover more than 600 acres, making them some of the largest manmade waste piles in the United States.



The piles can also contain several billion gallons of highly acidic wastewater, which can threaten human health and cause severe environmental damage if it reaches groundwater or local waterways.



Under the settlement, Mosaic Fertilizer will establish a $630 million trust fund, which will be invested until it reaches full funding of $1.8 billion.



These funds will cover the future closure of four Mosaic facilitiesthe Bartow, New Wales and Riverview plants in Florida and the Uncle Sam plant in Louisianaand also be put toward the treatment of hazardous wastewater at and long-term care of those facilities and two additional facilities which are already undergoing closure.



Mosaic Fertilizer's parent company, which is one of the largest fertilizer maker, will provide financial guarantees for this work. The settlement also requires Mosaic Fertilizer to submit a $50 million letter of credit.



Mosaic has committed to spend $170 million on projects to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing and waste management programs at its facilities and $2.2 million on two local environmental projects.



Mosaic will also pay a $5 million civil penalty to the United States, $1.55 million to the State of Louisiana and $1.45 million to the State of Florida, who joined the Department of Justice and EPA as plaintiffs in this case.



""This settlement represents our most significant enforcement action in the mining and mineral processing arena, and will have a significant impact on bringing all Mosaic facilities into compliance with the law,"" said Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division in a statement.



""Moreover, through this settlement, we establish critical financial assurance to cover the enormous closure and care costs at all these facilities. This sets the standard for our continuing enforcement of RCRA in the entire phosphoric acid industry. And, it reflects our emphasis on working jointly with impacted states.""



The alleged violations in this case stem from storage and disposal of waste from the production of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, key components of fertilizers, at Mosaic's facilities in Bartow, Lithia, Mulberry and Riverview, Florida, and St. James and Uncle Sam, Louisiana.



At all these units Mosaic failed to properly treat, store, and dispose of hazardous waste, and also failed provide adequate financial assurance for closure of its facilities.



""This case is a major victory for clean water, public health and communities across Florida and Louisiana,"" said Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles for EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.



Mosaic produces phosphorus-based fertilizer that is commonly applied to corn, wheat and other crops across the country. Sulfuric acid is used to extract phosphorus from mined rock, which produces large quantities of a solid material called phosphogypsum and wastewater that contains high levels of acid.



EPA inspections revealed that Mosaic was mixing certain types of highly-corrosive substances from its fertilizer operations, which qualify as hazardous waste, with the phosphogypsum and wastewater from mineral processing, which is a violation of federal and state hazardous waste laws.



As part of EPA's National Enforcement Initiative for mining and mineral processing, the agency has required phosphate fertilizer production facilities to reduce the storage volumes of hazardous wastewaters, ensure that waste piles and ponds have environmentally-protective barriers installed and verify the structural stability of waste piles and ponds.



Mosaic has committed to spending approximately $170 million over the next several years to implement an innovative reconfiguration of their current operations and waste management systems.



Under the settlement, Mosaic will also fund a $1.2 million environmental project in Florida to mitigate and prevent certain potential environmental impacts associated with an orphaned industrial property located in Mulberry, Florida. In Louisiana, Mosaic will spend $1 million to fund studies regarding statewide water quality issues.



Commenting on the settlement, Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Mosaic Company, said, ""We are pleased to be bringing this matter to a close.""



""In the years since EPA began this enforcement initiative, Mosaic has voluntarily made a number of major improvements to and significant capital investments in our facilities to enhance environmental performance, and the settlements will build upon that good work,"" added O'Rourke."
528|Departing Dallas district attorney wins final battle|"People are more willing to save money when offered the chance to win a prize through their savings acount, says a study.



The researchers examined the possibility of using lotteries to induce savings behaviour.



""When we made these future payments risky, people were actually more willing to save for the future,"" Hyndman,"" said Kyle Hyndman, associate professor of finance and managerial economics at The University of Texas at Dallas in the US.



The researchers conducted a controlled experiment with 96 college students to compare the success of a Prize Linked Savings (PLS) account to that of a standard interest bearing account.



A PLS savings account adds a randomly determined element to an otherwise standard savings account.



The idea behind PLS products is to leverage the appeal of gambling to entice people to invest in savings products that offer a positive expected return.



Instead of receiving a typical fixed-interest rate, depositors periodically receive a chance to win a specified, and potentially large, prize in accordance with their deposit amounts - that is larger deposits means a higher chance of winning.



The researcehrs found participants were more likely to save money when they were offered the possibility of winning large cash prizes, instead of smaller fixed-interest rates.



The appeal of the PLS product appears to be greatest among men, self-reported lottery players and those who reported relatively low amounts in their existing bank accounts, the study said.



The study was published in the Journal of Public Economics."

530|Retail Sales Up Despite Occupy Protests|"Hong Kong’s retail sales improved during the second month of a 79-day long street occupation by pro-democracy demonstrators, defying naysayers.

According to official government figures, Hong Kong’s November retail sales value rose 4.1 percent year-on-year to HK$41.3 billion ($5.3 billion), contrary to the expected 0.2 percent contraction from 1.4 percent in October. The increased retails sales came at a time when the Occupy pro-democracy protests were in full swing.

A government spokesman attributes the better-than-expected overall sales figures to greater consumer desire and increased tourist arrivals in November.

Apple’s new iPhone 6 models helped boost consumer durables to a 14.6 percent year-on-year growth, while sales of miscellaneous durable goods, including smartphones, grew 35.4 percent, according to the Census and Statistics Department numbers.

Supermarket sales rose to 3.5 percent and department stores grew 4.9 percent. Sales of cosmetics and medicine also rose 10.3 percent.

The luxury goods category—watches, jewelery, valuable gifts—continued to slump with a 2 percent drop from last year, following a 11.6 percent fall luxury goods sales in October.

Analysts suggest poor luxury goods sales is due to Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive stopping mainland high officials, military officers, and civil servants from splurging, and not a direct effect of the Umbrella Movement protests.

Mainland tourists, however, are still arriving in droves to Hong Kong and driving retail sales.

November saw a 24 percent year-on-year increase of Chinese tourists, according to government figures. That amounts to more than 4.1 million mainland visitors, and accounts for 78 percent of all tourist arrivals. This is a step up from the 18.3 percent rise in mainland tourists in October.

The surge in Chinese tourists belies the Chinese regime’s threat to stop mainland Chinese from entering Hong Kong, a move that would hurt the economy of the semiautonomous southern Chinese city.

“We haven’t seen major impacts from the Occupy campaign on tourists’ interest in Hong Kong except in early October shortly after it broke out,” said Andy Kwan Cheuk-chiu, an independent economist, to the Hong Kong Standard.

Kwan also predicts a 4 to 5 percent growth in retail sales in December.

Scaremongering?

Going by government figures and analyst predictions, the Occupy protests has barely affected Hong Kong’s economy.

However, the authorities have constantly stressed throughout the nearly three month street occupation that unless the pro-democracy demonstrators stand down, the city’s economy could see lasting damage.

“I am worried that, as the protests and political disputes go on, the consumer market will be further affected, and that the business environment will become more unstable,” said Financial Secretary John Tsang on Dec. 1, as the authorities prepared to clear the remaining protest sites in Admiralty and Causeway Bay.

Tsang added he was “definitely not scaremongering” about the Occupy protests’ impact on the city’s economy.

The Hong Kong government could be spot on because the Umbrella Movement did not end when police evicted protesters from Causeway Bay. Protesters simply transitioned from static occupation to an on-going, flash-mob style “Shopping Revolution” in the commercial neighborhood of Mong Kok.

Official retails sales numbers for December are also not yet out.

But based on available financial data for the first two months of street occupations, the Hong Kong government could have been overstating the economic damage caused by the Umbrella Movement when protests were at its peak.

531|Parental suicide attempt linked to increased suicidal behavior in offspring|"It is estimated that each year, at least 1 million people in the US intentionally self-harm, with some intending to take their own lives. Now, a new study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry finds that a suicide attempt by a parent with a mood disorder may significantly increase the risk of offspring attempting suicide.



Offspring of parents with a mood disorder who have attempted suicide were found to be much more likely to attempt suicide themselves. Offspring of parents with a mood disorder who have attempted suicide were found to be much more likely to attempt suicide themselves.

The research team, including Dr. David A. Brent of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA, notes that previous studies have indicated that suicide risk may run in families.

A 2012 study reported by Medical News Today, for example, found that young people are more likely to attempt suicide within 2 years of a parent attempting suicide.

However, Dr. Brent and colleagues say few studies have analyzed what leads to suicidal behavior running in families, and this was something the researchers wanted to address with their study.

To reach their findings, the team analyzed 334 parents with mood disorders and their 701 children who were aged 10-50 years. Of the parents, 191 (57.2%) had attempted suicide. Their children were followed for an average of 5.6 years.

At study baseline, the children were required to undergo structured psychiatric assessments and self-reported questionnaires, allowing the researchers to establish the presence of any mental health disorders and suicidal behavior.

Parental suicide attempt increased odds of offspring suicide attempt fivefold

The team found that 44 (6.3%) of the 701 children had attempted suicide prior to the study, while 29 (4.1%) made a suicide attempt during study follow-up. Of these, 19 (65.5%) made a first-time suicide attempt.

Even after accounting for previous offspring suicide attempts and familial transmission of a mood disorder, the researchers found that children of parents who made a suicide attempt were almost five times more likely to attempt suicide themselves.

The researchers note, however, that as participants aged, the incidence of depression among offspring increased from 29.6% in the first 1-2 years to 48.2% by study end. This may explain the increased risk of attempted suicide among offspring whose parents made a suicide attempt.

The team adds:

""In fact, impulsive aggression played an important role in increasing the likelihood of an offspring suicide attempt, but it did so by increasing the risk of the subsequent development of a mood disorder, which in turn increased the risk of an attempt. The transition from impulsive aggression to mood disorder may be particularly salient to understanding recurrent suicidal behavior because this pathway from offspring suicide attempt at baseline to an attempt at follow-up was mediated by offspring impulsive aggression and mood disorder.""

Based on their findings, Dr. Brent and colleagues recommend interventions that target impulsive aggression in order to prevent children at high familial risk from attempting suicide.

""Future work should focus on the deconstruction of suicidal behavior into intermediate biobehavioral phenotypes to further elucidate mechanisms by which suicidal behavior is transmitted from parent to child,"" they add.

In November, MNT reported on a study led by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, MD, which found that short-term counseling may reduce the risk of repeat suicide attempts.

Even at rest, the normal rhythm of the heart fluctuates, reflecting influences and changes in other parts of the body.



Generally speaking, the greater the heart rate variability or HRV, the better, the study pointed out.



""It (the study) suggests that an altered state of the autonomic nervous system may contribute to vulnerability and resilience to PTSD, along with known risk factors, such as combat exposure and preexisting stress and trauma symptoms,"" said first author of the study Arpi Minassian, professor at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine in the US.



PTSD is a mental health condition linked to a number of maladies, including anger, insomnia, substance abuse and chronic depression. It is particularly associated with people deployed to war.



For this study, researchers investigated whether reduced HRV before combat deployment conferred increased risk of a PTSD diagnosis after deployment.



From July 2008 to October 2013, they assessed two large cohorts of active-duty US Marines one to two months before combat deployment and again four to six months after their return.



After accounting for deployment-related combat exposure, the researchers found that Marines with reduced HRV prior to deployment displayed increased vulnerability to PTSD upon return.



The researchers said that if the findings are buttressed by future studies, it may suggest new opportunities for preventing PTSD by addressing the biology of the autonomic nervous system.



The study appeared in the journal JAMA Psychiatry."

Prior to the two dimensional rating Eva’s Village received four consecutive 4-star ratings and since broadening its scope to include an assessment of accountability and transparency Eva’s Village has continued to receive a 4-star rating for four more consecutive years.

""Only 7% of the charities we rate have received at least 4 consecutive 4-star evaluations, indicating that Eva’s Village outperforms most other charities in America,"" said Ken Berger, President & CEO of Charity Navigator. ""This “exceptional” designation from Charity Navigator differentiates Eva's Village from its peers and demonstrates to the public it is worthy of their trust.""

Marie Reger, executive director at Eva’s Village says, ""We are proud to have earned our fourth consecutive 4-star rating from Charity Navigator since they have implemented their two dimensional rating system — receiving four out of a possible four stars under this new, more critical evaluation system indicates how hard everyone at Eva’s Village works to execute our mission in a fiscally responsible way. We utilize our revenue in a responsible manner allowing us to help more of those in the greatest need, and both private and government funders have confidence that the funding they provide will be utilized with strict accountability.""

536|Israel PM faces party vote ahead of snap elections|"Jerusalem (AFP) - Members of Israel's ruling rightwing Likud voted Wednesday for their party leader, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeking another term at the helm ahead of early elections in March.

The primary, in which 96,651 members were eligible to vote, was the first electoral hurdle for Netanyahu, who is hoping to secure a third consecutive term in office.

Voting ended at 10 pm (2000 GMT), with turnout at more than 53 percent, official figures showed.

Final results are due early Thursday.

Political analysts say Netanyahu is expected to win the vote in the face of a single challenger, Danny Danon, a former deputy defence minister and outspoken member of Likud party's far-right fringe.

Members also voted to determine the frontrunners on the party list for the March 17 general election.

Casting his ballot at a polling station in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said the party must unify in the face of threats from the left.

""It is important at the end of the day that there be one strong Likud against the left in order to lead the state of Israel safely,"" he said in remarks broadcast on army radio.

The party last held a primary in January 2012, when members voted out three leading moderates, heralding a shift to the right likely to be further cemented in Wednesday's ballot.

""Voters will be determining not only the face of Likud but its ideological agenda in the years to come,"" wrote Yuval Karni in the Yediot Aharonot newspaper, which holds an anti-Netanyahu stance.

""While the result of the primary is a foregone conclusion -- Netanyahu is expected to easily defeat his sole rival Danny Danon -- the big question is what will the list look like.""

Polls suggest Likud is likely to face a challenge in March from a centre-left alliance of the opposition Labour party and the centrist HaTnuah of former justice minister Tzipi Livni.

- 'Fighting for survival' -

Commentator Yoaz Hendel said Likud was a party ""fighting for survival"" with little to offer in terms of dynamic leaders likely to garner votes.

""Today's Likud has no new, youthful, charismatic energy, and there is also no range of opinions,"" he wrote in Yediot.

""When Likud loses the ability to present itself as a rightwing, liberal, pragmatic party, it also loses its ability to govern. It loses its ability to attract voters from the centre.""

In the centre-right Maariv newspaper, Arik Bender said Likud officials were concerned that the party list would lack any fresh faces and end up being ""too extremist"" for voters.

General elections had been due in late 2017, but the polls were brought forward by Netanyahu in early December after the collapse of his fractious coalition.

The hawkish premier has been in office since 2009, following a first term in 1996-1999.

Tamir Sheafer, a political science expert from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said it was unlikely the primary would herald any major changes.

""We will most likely merely see a variation of the current list,"" he told AFP.

He said it was unlikely that the composition of the list would have a major impact on voting patterns for Likud in the upcoming election, or on the likely makeup of the next coalition government.

""The composition of a party is... less relevant than what people think,"" he said. ""People ultimately vote either for the party’s name or the party’s leader.""

Seventy candidates were vying for places on the party list, with all 18 of its lawmakers running for re-election except outgoing Culture and Sport Minister Limor Livnat, who is retiring from politics."

The 31-year-old decided to explore the shafts – where carved passageways can play tricks on the eyes – after hearing about the mine from a friend.

When he arrived he was surprised to find that the entrance had already been pried open by previous explorers.

While one would expect the decommissioned mine to be dry and stuffy, the Russian engineer said the air was wet and clean and it was easy to breathe, despite being 100ft underground.

Vladimir said: ‘It felt incredible to walk around the tunnels, it was like a maze but it felt as if we were inside an ancient temple or somewhere else beyond time and space.

538|Columnists - Law For Everyone|"There are other cheaper options for those who cannot afford RM300,000.



IN our country, being a lawyer is governed by the Legal Profession Act 1976 in Peninsular Malaysia, the Advocates Ordinance of Sabah Cap 2 in Sabah, and the Advocates Ordinance of Sarawak Cap 110 in Sarawak.

In Peninsular Malaysia, such a person would be referred as advocate and solicitor and in Sabah and Sarawak as advocate.

How much money do you need to become a lawyer? A reader, having done a foundation course in a local institution, was told that he needed to do the third year in Britain. Not only that, he would not be eligible to enrol for the Certificate in Legal Practice (CLP) but would also have to do the Bar Examinations there.

This means another two years abroad and RM250,000 at least, with possibly more to be paid what with the higher pound sterling or lower ringgit. In the meantime, RM70,000 or more will have to be paid for the foundation course for the two years study which is done locally. Thus the reader faces a situation where he either finds the money or gives up the idea of becoming a lawyer.

At a time of the year, when Form 5 students are heading for the end-of-year examinations and will need to make career choices.

It would be useful for such people and the parents to understand the scenario so that they can avoid the plight of the reader.

One does not need RM300,000 or more to embark upon or complete their law studies and to become a lawyer. What should you do?

After having passed the Form 5 examination with the appropriate grades, ensure that any pre-university course enrolled for is widely recognised. This is because foundation courses, with rare exceptions, restrict the choice of a university where the degree course can be pursued.

To start with, enrol for Form 6 in the national school system to obtain your STPM. You can stay at home and need only a very modest sum to pay certain fees or contributions which would, in most cases, amount to a few hundred ringgit. It may delay moving to university level a little, but what is the hurry when you consider the money that you can save.

This is because the A Level course and foundation programme may set you back RM15,000 or so. Many students are also inclined to bypass Form 6 because other friends are doing so.

However, losing a few months or a year is no big deal. If you have done Form 6, your pre-university studies would almost be for a song and with wider acceptance.

Next, you can choose to do a recognised law degree from a foreign university which will cost you in the region of RM45,000 to RM70,000. All this, which is being done locally would also save on living costs. This is especially when one lives in or near a large town.

With such a degree in hand, preceded either by a Form 6 Qualification or A Levels, the person would be entitled to enrol for and work towards obtaining the CLP conducted by the Legal Profession Qualification Board where fees and related expenses to complete the entire process would come to between RM4,000 and RM5,000.

What I have described is the route through obtaining a qualification from British universities or Australian and New Zealand universities, whether all the studies are done locally or part of the studies are done locally and part are done in a foreign country.

However, there is another route that one could take, by enrolling for the course which is made available by the University of Malaya Faculty of Law through the external degree programme of Bachelor of Jurisprudence.

This course can be done over a minimum period of three years, but must be completed within seven years. Just like the degree conferred by a foreign university where all the studies are being done locally or partly locally or partly aboard, it confers a qualification which enables the student to register for and pursue the CLP until successful completion and become a lawyer.

This is not in any way to deprecate those who have chosen to spend time overseas.

Some people say that this makes a better person and, some say, even a better lawyer. However, this is all a matter of perception and the character of the person involved.

When all the student’s studies are done locally there is also the added advantage of minimal or lower living costs for the duration of the studies.

Of course if one is supported by a full-fledged scholarship or parents or benefactors with deep pockets, money is of little or no importance. But not everyone will find himself in such a situation in our country.

If the cost is indeed RM300,000 or RM400,000, those who want to become lawyers may just give up the idea. That would be a pity.

Thus what has been set out above is to show the path to becoming a lawyer for those who may not have big money. They need not give up on doing law.

For those with less money, the ambition could still be achieved with a combination of family savings, available loan facilities and also a little help from friends and relatives.

The writer hopes that those who are sitting for the Form Five examination and are passionate about becoming lawyers but lack financial recourses will find the article useful.

539|2014: not such a bad year after all|"1 October 2015 -- Denouncing the ""warped ideology"" of the Islamic State or Iraq and the Levant [ISIL], the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato"" Sri Mohd Najib Bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, today urged the United Nations General Assembly to help spread awareness about the true nature of Islam, ""which is nothing like that entity""that usurps its name.""

""We must acknowledge that we are not winning the propaganda war against the so-called Islamic State. Their twisted narrative is not being adequately countered to prevent many misguided people from joining or supporting from afar,"" he said.

Speaking the truth about Islam is ever-more important, he said, stressing that non-State actors such as ISIL threaten to destroy sovereign States. They don't confine their horrific acts of cruelty within official boundaries.""

""It is sickening, and there could be no greater a slur on Islam "" a religion of peace, moderation and justice. But these extremists cannot be defeated by traditional military means alone,"" he continued.

""It is more important than ever that we spread awareness of authentic Islam, most especially when conflicts persist and people lose hope. For it is there that extremism finds fertile soil. And those who fight for extremism "" for a perversion of true Islam "" are one of the main drivers of the current migration crisis from the Middle East.""

Mr. Razak also spoke of the security risk posed to his nation and the need for international collaboration to share information on terrorism.

""Our tireless, ever-vigilant security forces have intercepted many would-be [ISIL] recruits transiting through Kuala Lumpur. It is because of our efforts that they have not fallen into the darkness that blights Syria and Iraq,"" he said.

""But some have. We have identified 39 Malaysians who have travelled to join [ISIL]. And we have arrested over 100 of our citizens suspected of links to [the group]. These threats are real.""

He also spoke of the need for Security Council reform ""to better reflect 2015""s realities, not 1945""s,"" he said.

""We were extremely disappointed that the proposed resolution to set up an international tribunal into the shooting down of flight MH17 did not go through because a veto was imposed,"" he noted. ""We will continue to seek justice through other legal options, because we owe it to the families of those who perished in this outrageous crime.""

Turning to the matter of the refugee crisis, Mr. Razak said that Malaysia would ""open our doors to a further 3,000 Syrian migrants over the next three years,"" adding that ""it is only when we see that dreadful picture of three year old Alan Kurdi washed ashore "" and recognize our own children in that tragic boy's innocent face "" that we will act as our better selves."""

+ Enlarge this image Those who plant their cane by preparing their land well and practise good husbandry will reap a better quality crop and get paid more than those who plant in an ad hoc manner, says Lieutenant Colonel Manasa Vaniqi. Picture: FILE

CANEGROWERS are being urged to prepare themselves for the introduction of the cane quality payment system next season.

Sugar permanent secretary Lieutenant Colonel Manasa Vaniqi said vigorous awareness campaigns would be conducted next year in the lead up to the start of the cane crushing season.

""We have done quite a lot of awareness last year and the year before but it is a new concept and it is imperative that growers fully understand how the system works,"" he said.

""Those who plant their cane by preparing their land well and practise good husbandry will reap a better quality crop and get paid more than those who plant in an ad hoc manner. So the onus is on farmers to attend the awareness campaigns and seek assistance from the industry stakeholders if they want to plant a better crop and increase their yield per hectare at the same time.""

Lt-Col Vaniqi said the cane quality payment system would be run in parallel with the traditional pay-by-weight system to give growers an opportunity to see the difference in how much they would receive.

Sugar Cane Growers Council CEO Sundresh Chetty welcomed the move to hold more discussions with farmers over the planned system. ""We need more awareness and running the cane quality system alongside the current payment based on weight will give growers a better idea of what to expect when the system goes fully online,"" he said.

542|Elo Adhekpukoli: Re: Kali Gwegwe: Pastor Osinbajo – Giving Christianity a bad name|"Dear Kali Gwegwe, I read your article about Pastor Osinbajo published in Daily Post of December, 30, 2014, with much interest. I wonder how you formed your opinion that Pastor Osinbajo is sending a message that ‘politics-not Christianity can help bring out the best in men’. I also wonder how you came to the conclusion that the ‘desire for political power is what is making him to do what he could not do as a pastor’. Misleading articles like yours have been the bane of religious and political unity in our nation.

It would be helpful if you knew what Pastor Osinbajo has been doing as pastor. Pastor Osinbajo is closer to the poor and downtrodden than you think. That he engages people in BRT buses is not a sudden change of behaviour on account of politics as you have asserted. That he is seen today interacting with men perceived to be ordinary is not a sudden change of behaviour as you have asserted. It is not news to see a pastor of the RCCG engaged in bus evangelism or door to door evangelism or preaching to the poor. Pastor Osinbajo does this routinely.

What is news is that a Vice Presidential candidate is humble enough to enter a public bus to interact with men perceived to be ordinary. Pastor Osinbajo’s good activities have now become a centre of attraction, because his nomination as the Vice-Presidential candidate of the APC means that he is now under the radar of the media. Pastor Osinbajo can no longer do good quietly without being noticed! That is not his fault!

Pastor Osinbajo is like a newly found kaleidoscopic treasure that continues to amaze everyone with his profile and lovable personality. This amazement is not strange especially against the backdrop that the idiosyncracy of the average Nigerian has been so abused with much hypocrisy that they have lost the sense of what it means to ‘practice what you preach’. Pastor Osinbajo is not the traditional hypocritical politician. He is just being his humble self by interacting with men perceived to be ordinary. His entrance into the presidential race has not changed him.

That his service to God is now news worthy on account of his political aspiration does not warrant any attack on his person and the quality of his service to God. Those who hide under the gospel to pass judgment and misinform people constitute the resistance many have to the gospel of Jesus. They polarise the church and society and their conduct has never helped humanity. I do not think you want to be counted among such people.

Engaging in mudslinging against Pastor Osinbajo without knowing his antecedents is unfair. I do not think you intended to be so unfair. But I may be wrong, because your allegation that Pastor Osinbajo ‘is probably’ among the legion of Christian leaders that criticize Prophet T.B. Joshua, exposes some bias and bigotry. I wonder where that allegation is coming from.

I feel a sense of brotherly love to you and citizens of our country, likely to be misled by your article, to set the records straight. I am sure you and your readers will discover how judgmental your article was, after reading this rejoinder. You certainly do not know the extent of Pastor Osinbajo’s impact in the lives of the poor and downtrodden before now. I have known Pastor Osinbajo since 2006 and will outline a few things I know about him that contradict what you have told the whole world.

You will be surprised to know that Pastor Osinbajo has always identified with the poor and downtrodden in society. He has never made a public show of his good works like the hypocritical politicians we were used to before now. I have had the privilege of visiting the church he pastors at various times. His ministry is based on the principle that care for the material needs of the poor is the central focus of the ministry of Jesus Christ and must be that of every serious Christian.

You will also be surprised to know that the same Pastor Osinbajo, before now, has traversed the slums in Lagos including Ikota and Makoko (slums worse than the popular Ajegunle), interacting with the poorest of the poor, leading them to Christ and meeting their needs. Pastor Osinbajo did not only associate with the poor in these slums, he set up learning centres for them through the LIBERTY SCHOOLS project.

Pastor Osinbajo runs 10 ministries in his church entirely devoted to the poor. I will mention just a few. MERCYCROSS gives medical insurance to children of the poor. LIBERTY SCHOOLS with branches at Obanikoro, Makoko and Ikota slums have about 400 children of the poor in school already. WOMEN ALIVE provides free pre and post natal care for underprivileged women. PARENTS-WITHOUT-BORDERS engages in parenting and mentoring for boys and girls in remand homes.

Pastor Osinbajo also supports many initiatives that feed, accommodate, rehabilitate and sponsor the education and healthcare of abandoned street children and widows. I know about The Orderly Society Trust, which he set up with his wife and The Destiny Trust Children Foundation. There is also the EXCEL PROJECT a reading and writing programme in 40 public schools. There are more of such initiatives focused on the poor, which he supports and identifies with.

An interesting fact you do not have is that Pastor Osinbajo and his wife, Dolapo, before, during and after his tenure as Attorney-General of Lagos State, consistently engaged beggars, drug addicts and societal rejects under the bridges of Lagos. Many of them have come to the knowledge of Christ, are gainfully employed and married today. I recommend to you, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo’s book, ‘They Call Me Mama’. I am sure you will enjoy reading the book.

I admire your admission that truth is ‘just’ and ‘correctional’, which according to you, formed the fundamental basis of your article. You owe Nigerians and your fellow Christian brethren an unreserved apology for going to town with so much ignorance and false notions about Pastor Yemi Osinbajo. Just as you have held Pastor Osinbajo responsible for his actions, (which are consistent with his Christian ethics) I also hold you responsible for your misleading article. Those who make public comments owe the public the obligation of truth

544|One Post & Courier columnist could use a First Amendment primer|"I'm generally a fan of Post and Courier columnist Brian Hicks. In fact, I wrote a column a few years ago praising his enlightened and compassionate views, views that are largely different from the harsh, right-wing rhetoric that has emanated for generations from the Manigault family's dull, gray journal. In fact, in that February 2012 column I wrote that Hicks' work ""has been a breath of fresh air and good sense in that stodgy old institution.""

So I was surprised and more than a little disappointed when Hicks recently decided to use his column in a personal jihad against secular humanists. In two separate columns he went after humanists for intervening in a clearly unconstitutional collaboration of church and state in Dorchester County.

To recap the story: Students at Dorchester District 2's Oakbrook Elementary School were collecting food and money last fall to support a food drive sponsored by Old Fort Baptist Church. No one disputes that it was a worthy cause for both the church and the children of Oakbrook Elementary. But sometimes even good intentions must be properly directed.

In this case, the school collection was a clear violation of the Establishment Clause, whereby governments and their agencies — that would be Oakbrook Elementary School — may not endorse any religion or creed. It is the same well-established principle that the U.S. Supreme Court enunciated in its famous ""school prayer"" decision of 1962, which declared that public schools could not sponsor nor endorse prayer.

It doesn't take a law degree to grasp that this principle would also apply to a church food drive. I am surprised Hicks didn't get it.

Several secular humanist parents of DD2 children took the issue to the American Humanist Association, which sent a letter to school district officials threatening legal action if Oakbrook Elementary did not cease collecting food and money for the church. The letter did not comment on the rightness or wrongness of food drives, and did not tell individuals they could not support Old Fort Baptist Church's food drive. The letter was directed at blocking a public institution from using public resources to support a religious institution.

Of course, people were upset. Brian Hicks was one of them. In a Nov. 28 column he called the action of the American Humanist Association ""malarkey"" and ""a frivolous lawsuit."" He even wrote, ""Oscar Mayer doesn't produce this much baloney on an annual basis."" Amy Monsky, president of Secular Humanists of the Lowcountry, responded, chastising Hicks in a Dec. 3 Post and Courier op-ed. I guess this is where I speak up to say that I am a member of SHL, and I cheered Monsky through every paragraph of her column.

She pointed out that SHL is involved in a number of community service programs, including those that feed the needy. And she said that humanist parents — including the parents of DD2 children who first brought this issue to the public's attention — teach their children to be good citizens and compassionate human beings.

Then she took Hicks to school on the Constitution: ""Public schools are government institutions and must comply with the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. This means that schools and teachers must not promote or endorse any particular religion. While promoting charitable acts is noble, it is important that it is done in a way that neither violates the law nor disenfranchises any students.""

A few days later DD2 surrendered the point and agreed to direct its food drive efforts to nonsectarian public service agencies. A couple of fringe benefits of this little spat are that the DD2 students got a close up look at the way the Constitution, the courts, and the press work in a free society.

In response to the flap and all the name-calling, the Secular Humanists of the Lowcountry put together an online fund-raising campaign for needy students in Dorchester District 2. At last count, they had raised more than $2,300.

As for Mr. Hicks, he wrote a follow-up column on the whole secular humanist controversy just before Christmas. This time his tone was much softer. Something or someone had gotten to him. Or maybe he had just taken a quiet moment to think the whole thing through. In his softer, wiser voice he conceded that there would have been a lot of angry parents if Oakbrook School's children were supplying the food pantry at a mosque. Maybe there are better ways to do good than through religious organizations.

One thing we can all agree on: The same First Amendment which protects Brian Hicks' right to publish his views also protects the right of secular interests to intervene when there is a clear mingling of church and state — no matter how minor. If the government were messing with his press freedom, Hicks would be the first to brandish the Constitution and demand his day in court.

Case closed."
545|First AirAsia victims arrive in Indonesia - World News|"EPA Indonesian military personnel carries two coffins with the remain of bodies recovered from the AirAsia crash site as they arrive at Juanda Airport, in Surabaya, Indonesia. Picture: MADE NAGI

Pangkalan Bun/ Surabaya, Indonesia - The first two bodies from the AirAsia plane that crashed off the coast of Borneo arrived on Wednesday in the Indonesian city of Surabaya, where relatives have gathered to await news of their loved ones.

Rescuers believe they have found the plane on the sea floor off Borneo, after sonar detected a large, dark object beneath waters near where debris and bodies were found on the surface.

Ships and planes had been scouring the Java Sea for Flight QZ8501 since Sunday, when it lost contact during bad weather about 40 minutes into its flight from Surabaya to Singapore.

Seven bodies have been recovered from the sea, some fully clothed, which could indicate the Airbus A320-200 was intact when it hit the water. That would support a theory that it suffered an aerodynamic stall.

Tatang Zaenudin, an official with Indonesia's search and rescue agency, said earlier that one of the bodies found had been wearing a life jacket.

But he later said no victim had been recovered with a life jacket on.

“We found a body at 8.20am and a life jacket at 10.32am so there was a time difference. This is the latest information we have,” he told Reuters.

Two bodies, in coffins bedecked with flowers and marked 001 and 002, arrived by an air force plane in Surabaya.

Most of the 162 people on board were Indonesians. No survivors have been found.

Hernanto, head of the search and rescue agency in Surabaya, said rescuers believed they had found the plane on the sea bed with a sonar scan in water 30-50 metres deep.

The black box flight data and cockpit voice recorder have yet to be found.

Authorities in Surabaya were making preparations to receive and identify bodies, including arranging 130 ambulances to take victims to a police hospital and collecting DNA from relatives.

“We are praying it is the plane so the evacuation can be done quickly,” Hernanto said.

Strong wind and waves hampered the search and with visibility at less than a kilometre (half a mile), the air operation was called off in the afternoon.

“We are all standing by,” Dwi Putranto, heading the air force search effort in Pangkalan Bun on Borneo, told Reuters.

“If we want to evacuate bodies from the water, it's too difficult. The waves are huge and it's raining.”

Indonesian President Joko Widodo said his priority was retrieving the bodies.

Relatives, many of whom collapsed in grief when they saw the first grim television pictures confirming their fears on Tuesday, held prayers at a crisis centre at Surabaya airport.

The plane was travelling at 9 753 metres and had asked to fly at 38 000 feet to avoid bad weather. When air traffic controllers granted permission for a rise to 34 000 feet a few minutes later, they received no response.

The pilots did not issue a distress signal.

A source close to the probe into what happened said that radar data appeared to show that AirAsia Flight QZ8501 made an “unbelievably” steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the Airbus A320's limits.

“So far, the numbers taken by the radar are unbelievably high. This rate of climb is very high, too high. It appears to be beyond the performance envelope of the aircraft,” he said.

The source, who declined to be named, added that more information was needed to come to a firm conclusion.

Online discussion among pilots has centred on unconfirmed secondary radar data from Malaysia that suggested the aircraft was climbing at a speed of 353 knots, about 100 knots too slow, and that it might have stalled.

The Indonesian captain, a former air force fighter pilot, had 6 100 flying hours under his belt and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, said the airline, which is 49 percent owned by Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia .

Three airline disasters involving Malaysian-affiliated carriers in less than a year have dented confidence in the country's aviation industry and spooked travellers.

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing in March on a trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew and has not been found. On July 17, the same airline's Flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.

On board Flight QZ8501 were 155 Indonesians, three South Koreans, and one person each from Singapore, Malaysia and Britain. The co-pilot was French.

The AirAsia group, including affiliates in Thailand, the Philippines and India, had not suffered a crash since its Malaysian budget operations began in 2002. - Reuters

546|Chicago Crime Commission's Art Bilek retires from law enforcement -- CHICAGO, Dec. 31, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ --|"CHICAGO, Dec. 31, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago City Council officially proclaimed today Arthur J. Bilek Day in Chicago. The honor is in recognition of Bilek as he concludes a law enforcement career that spanned more than 60 years, culminating with his retirement from the Chicago Crime Commission.

""As Executive Vice President of the Chicago Crime Commission since 2010, Art Bilek has been one of the organization's greatest assets,"" according to J.R. Davis, Chairman and President of the Chicago Crime Commission. ""Among his many accomplishments, Art Bilek spearheaded efforts to join forces with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in naming a new Public Enemy Number One. The title, originally coined for Al Capone by the Chicago Crime Commission in 1930, was assigned to Joaquin Guzman Loera in 2013. Guzman, one of society's most vicious, ruthless and powerful drug kingpins, was captured in Mexico in 2014,"" he said.

Art Bilek is considered to be one of the most knowledgeable and experienced persons in the field of organized crime in Chicago. ""His initial exposure to organized crime was as a special investigator for the Cook County State's Attorney, working as one of the arresting officers in the Summerdale Police District's 'Burglars in Blue' scandal. He also worked on the Chicago Outfit's infamous 'floating crap game' and led the successful raid and arrest of Mafia Don Rocco Fischetti,"" Davis continued.

Under the leadership of Sheriff Richard Ogilvie, Bilek was named police chief and reorganized and reformed the corrupt Cook County Sheriff's Police Department and drafted legislation for improving law enforcement and crime fighting in Illinois.

""Art Bilek also contributed to academia by developing and writing the curriculum for the first baccalaureate program in criminal justice in the United States and served as founder, chairman and professor of the University of Illinois, Chicago, Criminal Justice Department,"" Davis added.

Bilek also served as the first corporate director of security for the Hilton Hotel Corporation and later as the Vice President and Corporate Director of Security and Investigations for the First National Bank of Chicago. He has been involved with the Chicago Crime Commission for 30 years and is a life member of the commission.

""While we wish our friend Art a well-deserved retirement, I told him to expect a periodic call from the Chicago Crime Commission looking for his invaluable advice,"" Davis concluded.

Basin Electric signs agreements with two wind projects totaling 300 megawatts

BISMARCK - Basin Electric Power Cooperative announced Wednesday it has signed power purchase agreements with new wind farms in Richardton and Tioga.

The NextEra Energy Resources plant will be called the Dickinson Wind Energy Center and produce 150 megawatts at the farm near Richardton. Tradewind Energy is developing the Lindahl Wind Project, another 150 megawatt farm near Tioga.

NextEra’s farm is slated to be complete by the end of 2015, and Tradewind’s by the end of 2016.

“We are tremendously excited to be in North Dakota where the wind energy industry is only beginning to capitalize on the region’s enormous potential,"" Sanjay Bhasin, Tradewind’s senior vice president for business development, said in a Basin press release."
548|Whether for Life or for One Year, Banning Blood Donations From Gay and Bi Men Is Bad Science|"Just before Christmas, the FDA accepted the recommendation of a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services panel and announced that it would modify its ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men. Instead of barring such men from donation for life, as the policy had done up to that point, the FDA will now accept blood from gay and bisexual men who have been celibate for at least one year.

While this shift represents nominally better policy, it preserves the ban's core problem: the fact that the FDA is targeting a high-risk group (men who have sex with men) instead of high-risk behavior (unprotected sex, especially unprotected receptive anal sex, with multiple partners -- regardless of the gender of those involved). Not only is the ban unjust, but statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicate that the policy is scientifically baseless.

The FDA's blood-donation guidelines apply to questionnaires used by the Red Cross and other blood-collection agencies. Prospective donors respond to survey questions that ask about their travel history, drug usage, and other risk factors associated with disease transmission. People with certain responses are asked to disqualify themselves from donation.

Because it highlights activities that increase the risk of disease, this practice should function as an important educational tool. But by suggesting that gay and bisexual men are at risk and straight people aren't, the FDA's guidelines misinform the public. To the extent that it contributes to ignorance of the risks associated with certain types of heterosexual sex, the FDA's policy, even in its revised form, actually presents a public-health concern.

The FDA's insistence on outdated, unscientific guidelines for blood-donor deferral also undermines its credibility more generally. Diminished credibility could have significant ramifications; for example, it may be harder to debunk the myth that vaccinations cause autism without high levels of public confidence in the FDA. Most of the FDA's recommendations about food and drug safety are surely legitimate, but critics of these recommendations can now point to a clear instance -- blood-donor-eligibility criteria -- in which the organization has disregarded the facts.

Some people might contend that the one-year ban is an improvement, albeit a very small one, over the lifetime ban. As minimal progress can be considered better than no progress at all, this argument isn't necessarily wrong. But organizations also sometimes adopt nominally better policy to pacify opposition and avert or postpone more sweeping changes.

Regardless of the FDA's motives in this case, their policy remains backwards. In addition to inappropriately stigmatizing gay and bisexual men, the blood ban spreads misinformation about public health and harms the FDA's credibility. It is therefore imperative that activists apply pressure until the FDA embraces science and adopts the focus on actual high-risk behavior that has worked in Italy for the past 13 years."

TB Joshua holds memorial service for grieving South Africans

LAGOS — Nigerian pastor TB Joshua will host a New Year’s memorial service for the South African relatives of those killed in a building collapse at his Lagos mega church.

A spokesman at Joshua’s Synagogue Church of All Nations said 44 South Africans had flown to Lagos to attend the ceremony following the September disaster which killed 116 people, including 81 South Africans.

Mr Joshua, a self-proclaimed prophet, ""is going to lead the service to commiserate and offer spiritual support,"" church spokesman Patrick Iwelumor said. ""As the chief mourner, there is a need for (Joshua) to connect with these people.""

Mr Joshua is one Nigeria’s wealthiest and most influential pastors whose followers include prominent politicians and business leaders from across Africa and around the world.

The Lagos state coroner is carrying out an inquest into the causes of the collapse at a guesthouse within the church’s compound.

Expert witnesses have said the structure was unsound and lacked proper permits, but Mr Joshua’s vocal followers have insisted the building came down as a result of foul play and was a bid to destroy the powerful religious leader.

Among the theories advanced by Joshua loyalists is that a plane flying in the area at the time of the collapse dropped an explosive device on the building.

One weapons expert called by the church’s lawyers, Beidomu Iguniwei, has testified that the collapse could have been caused by an ""infrasonic weapon"", although there appears to be no credible evidence to support that claim.

Testimony at the inquest has dismissed sabotage as a cause, including evidence from aviation officials who said the air force plane in question was on a routine training mission and had in fact landed before the building collapsed.

Mr Joshua has refused to honour a series of summons demanding his appearance at the inquest.

Some of his supporters have suggested it would be inappropriate for a so-called ""Man of God"" to be subjected to questioning.

Wednesday’s candlelight ceremony will begin at sundown and last through midnight, Mr Iwelumor said.

The victims’ relatives arrived in Nigeria on Christmas Day and Mr Joshua is said to have paid for their travel.

When the trip was announced earlier this month, some South Africans took to social media to condemn Mr Joshua’s move as a bribe aimed at discouraging relatives from filing a lawsuit over the deaths.

But the church’s South Africa-based spokesman, Kirsten Nematandani, has said the trip and New Year’s memorial service are about ""the spirit of caring"".

550|Airports give SpiceJet a 10-day reprieve|"While Government sources claim that the 10-day extension will be given only against a bank guarantee of around ₹180 crore, airline sources deny that any new bank guarantee is being sought

SpiceJet’s current curtailed operations will continue till January 10 without the airline having to pay an airport every time its aircraft lands or takes off.

This follows the airport operators agreeing to provide a 10-day extension to the financially strapped airline. The airline had till midnight Wednesday to clear its outstanding of about ₹200 crore to various airports.

What prompted the latest extension was not immediately clear. While Government sources claim that the 10-day extension will be given only against a bank guarantee of around ₹180 crore, airline sources deny that any new bank guarantee is being sought by the airports.

A financial crunch has seen the airline’s daily departures drop to 230 flights from 345 in July. SpiceJet’s operations from Delhi, which is a major hub for the airline with almost 20 per cent or over 70 of the 345 daily flights departing from here when the airline was operating all its flights, is unlikely to be affected as SpiceJet is “current” and maintains a bank guarantee with the airport operator, sources indicated.

Currently, Ajay Singh, one of the founder promoters of the airline, and JP Morgan are proposing to pump in $200 million in the cash-strapped airline. This was an indication that was given to senior officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation late last week.

The new investors plan to buy out the entire over 50 per cent stake of the Marans. The airline is currently controlled by billionaire Kalanithi Maran’s Sun Group.

555|SAARC Academia Marks 10th Anniversary of Tsunami 2004 Across Asia,--Decade Summit to Divulge KAKHTAH Post-doc Multiversity.|"A ten day summit has been organized by academicians of SAARC region universities to mark the 10th anniversary of Tsunami. Led by Justice (R) S.S. Paru, the summit ascribes resolutions of institutional significance concerning the disaster risk reduction. The ‘Decade Summit of Asian Tsunami’ is intended to switch on and amplify the critical issues of the UN’s DRR-HFA, especially for the regions most prone to disasters, says the summit’s official note on the occasion.

Disasters can occur anywhere, anytime, at any location, to any society. Asian Tsunami of 2004, is considered to be the most devastating disaster of modern history.

Asian Tsunami of 2004, devastated almost 9 major oceanic sectors of Asia, leaving over 5 million people as homeless, hundreds of thousands as displaced, and a toll rate exceeding 237,000.

The Tsunami was triggered by an earthquake of 9.1 magnitude having one of the history’s biggest tremors, that caused the tsunami that rumbled along the Indian ocean and intensely hit more than a dozen countries around the Indian ocean rim. Being closest to the quake’s epicenter, Indonesia’s Aceh became the first-hit and the hardest-hit area. In the beginning, due to the intense quake, that crashed the buildings and collapsed the towns, the people became panicked and frighteningly rushed through the streets and roads. Almost 20 minutes later, a 7 to 10 meters high, giant wall of seawater carrying along trees, towers, coastal installations, electric poles, buses and trains, surged to the landside with an un-counterable strength to eradicate communities, leaving millions as homeless, displaced and over 237,000 casualties across the oceanic rim.

The horrific, massive waves roared across the oceanic rim, hitting Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Sumatra, Thailand, and reached the East African zones of Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania.

Still, there remain numerous areas where the Tsunami victim populations have not recovered their lives fully. And still there remain certain communities populated in the coastal areas, prone to high risks of natural calamities.

Eradicating the communities, devastating the towns and cities, ruining the lands, the Tsunami 2004 left billions of human eyes teared, hearts sorrowed and the nations mourned-- marking one of the toughest moral tests for the rest of humanity- a hardest trial of human solidarity, for the whole world.

In order to mark the decade anniversary’s solemn inscriptive commemorations, people from different walks of life along with thousands of the survivors, government officials, academicians, diplomats, political leaders and the victims’ families gathered on the shorelines in the coastal zones of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Sumatra and Thailand.

Moments of silence were observed at several places to mark the moment, that made the entire world left mourning.

Besides the several memorials paid by victims, survivors and the general public, the academic commencements of Tsunami commemoration also became events of note. The enormous observance also divulged a Post-doc Multiversity KAKHTAH, to be established in Asia for higher research studies on disaster risk reduction.

Special featured reports and dedicatory contents have been published by the AP, BBC, CBC, ContentCo, Reuters and many other regional and local news dissemination services.

“Crying onlookers took part in beachside memorials and religious services across Asia to mark the 10th anniversary of the Indian Ocean tsunami that killed more than a quarter million people in one of the modern history's worst natural disasters,” says AP.

Indonesia’s Aceh province--the hardest-hit-area, marked the Tsunami’s first decade anniversary with abundant disquiets and trepidations. Memorial services were regulated and led by the Vice President Jusuf Kalla, who with other officials, laid flowers on the Siron Mass Grave, where thousands of Tsunami victims were buried.

Mr. Kalla, the Vice President of Indonesia, paid thanks to the nations, organizations, donors and the individuals who helped Aceh people in their ‘need hour’- a moment that was unprecedented in their previous history of tragedies. Awards were given to the ambassadors of the nations, that donated during the hard-moments.

In Sri Lanka, the Tsunami’s first decade anniversary was marked in different coastal areas, which were among the hard-hit zones of Tsunami. An Ocean Queen Express train, which became derailed by the powerful devastating Tsunami waves on 26 Dec. 2004, was again beset on track lines as a ‘symbol of tragedy’. The train was symbolized to memorialize the moment, when this train was hit by the toppling waves. Over 1750 people died in a single blow, making the world history’s biggest rail disaster. Tsunami’s ‘Un-sung Heroes’ awards have been bestowed on the individuals M.S.S. Salawal Salah of Galle, Mr. Faisar N.M. Ms. from Matara, Ms. Razana, Nashika Unais and Dr. Bareera N. B. from Pakistan, who paid their consummate and proficient services in different projects during the catastrophe’s aftermaths.

In Thailand, where foreigners from 38 countries were died beside the local victims, memorial events were held at Khao Lak. People placed flowers on a memorial wall, where the name of the victims were inscribed.

Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha led a memorial event at Khao Lak. He joined the relatives of the victims and laid a wreath of remembrance at a beached police boat site, that has become the symbolized sign of Tsunami for the Thai nation. The police boat 813 was bounced nearly 2 km away near Phuket.

The victims’ close relatives, the survivors and other people from the affected communities expressed their feelings on the occasion.

""I cannot forget the smell of the air, the water at that time ... even after 10 years,"" says Mr. Teuku, a 51 year old resident of Indonesia.

""I cannot forget how I lost my wife, my kids, my house,"" he said sobbing, recounting that he refused to believe for years that they had died but finally gave up looking for them, report the AP correspondents.

According to an institutional note from SAARC, a fortnight confluence summit under the aegis of UNISDR, titled ‘Decade Summit of Asian Tsunami’ has been organized in Sri Lanka, to mark the Tsunami’s first decade anniversary.

Following the record tweeting-i.e. over 4.3 million tweets, that were propelled up and sent to UTC on IDDR-2014, the Tsunami Decade Summit, also put high emphasis on age inclusive DRR frame-working.

The United Nations’ top official to deal with the natural disasters’ subject-matter, Margareta Wahlstrom says from Geneva,

“A decade since a tsunami killed 230,000 people in Southeast Asia, the world must do more to prepare for extreme weather,” reports the Fox News.

""Something odd is going on,"" with wild weather noticeably increasing recently, bringing more risks, adds further the special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for disaster risk reduction, Margareta Wahlstrom, according to the source.

According to the source, Wahlstrom told The Associated Press that the world is better prepared for calamities of the scale of the massive earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004 that triggered a 100-foot-high tsunami which spread death across a dozen countries. However, she says much more needs to be done, reports Fox News.

Besides the utmost wreckage desolation, and unprecedented scale of destruction, Tsunami-2004 brought forth a way to measure the ‘real impact factor’ in terms of the actual ‘on-ground renderings’ conceded thereupon.

An opinion poll was commissioned in hard-hit areas, in order to have the refugees, the survivors and victims their own say for-- ‘who did what for them’--- that brought some meant-content for them in the aftermaths of the highest-observed devastating catastrophe of the last two millennia’s recorded history of natural cataclysms.

The outcome of ‘Tsunami Opinion Polls’, coupled with inter-institutional and academic consensus, evoked the unanimity in lieu of a historic resolution for instituting a multiversity and a scholarship named ‘KAKHTAH’ in the SAARC region, for DRR studies at post-doctoral level. The scholarship is named after those who became responsible for bringing forth the real ‘difference’ during the hard test of human solidarity, through their meritorious renderings. The revolutionary-edged medal has been named after the four stalwarts; Kofi Annan (Former Sec. Gen. UN), Hellen Keller Intl.( A US based NGO) , Tzu-chi (An international NGO from Taiwan), and Aurangzeb Hafi (A multi-disciplinary arch-researcher from Pakistan), for their meritorious renderings in the Asian Tsunami 2004 relief works.

The historic, new-fangled KAKHTAH multiversity medal escorted with a 2.7 Million GBP scholarship is proclaimed to be bestowed into 1900 global academic ivories, on a biennial basis, for estimable post-doctoral research works in the areas of disaster management, catastrophic policy lay-outs, cataclysmic forecasting and calamity prevention methodologies.

The seven members conferring jury for KAKHTAH medal, that includes national and regional academic celebrities, is chaired by Justice(R) S.S. Paru, L.L.D., D.Litt., from Indonesia. Sri Lanka’s ombudsman Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria, who had been Sri Lankan High Commissioner in New Zealand and Australia, has been designated for serving as the senior assessor of jury. Dr. Faisar N.M., Dr. E.M. Navaratne and Dr. Alex Jayawardene are also adherent-members.

A selection slate named ‘Tsunami Slate of Merit’ was made with the view to reckon-surmise the real ‘on-ground impact factor’ of different institutional entities, relief projects and individuals with reference to Tsunami.

The selection slate draped a summing-up of 17 out-scored projects and 21 organizations. Amongst them are, the Oxfam, Save the Children, SOS, Rotary International, MAVSO Intl, Peak Freans-English Biscuits Manufacturers Ltd., Shadow Intl., and some regional and local organizations.

A scroll of gratitude has been given to the ‘Tsunami’s Un-sung Hero Award’ bequethee, MSS Salawal Salah , who volunteered in the hardest hit areas of distts. Galle, Hambantota, Kalmonai. The scroll is escorted with a sum of 7,50,000 LKR, for the young Sri Lankan philanthropic-striper. Mr. Salah 33, an acupuncturist, who stepped up to the portico-facade of one of the toughest tests of human solidarity, is a licentiate complementary therapist, certified under WHO, by Colombo South Government General University and Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka.

Another laurel of distinction ‘Tsunami’s Dame of Merit’ has been bequeathed on Dr. Bareera B. N., a Pakistani anthropologist, who rendered her services for Tsunami affected women, and came forward to accomplish EBM’s mission of food-supplments provisions in Tsunami refugees’ camps to address the mal-nutrition in babies as well as women.

A resolution has been unanimously passed by academicians from all major universities across the Tsunami-hit costal belt of Asia, that acclaims to establish a KAKHTAH Post-doc Multiversity in SAARC region, along with a post doc scholarship for DRR studies under the UN-HFA perspectives.

Famous River Kawai’s bridge has been renamed as ‘KAKHTAH-Tsunami Bridge’ to mark the 10th anniversary of Tsunami.

In several universities within the SAARC region, a number of ‘KAKHTAH Disaster Forecasting Centers’ are agreed to be instituted with a vision of cross-boundary and cross-disciplinary integration for disaster preparedness. UNESCO chairs at Punjab University and COMSATS become the first to establish the KAKHTAH repository in Pakistan, for disaster forecasting and preparedness, affirm the VC Prof. Dr. Mujahid Kamran, Dr. Hassan, UNESCO chair holder at COMSATS and Dr. Khalida M. Khan, holder of the UNESCO chair at PU.

Principal investigators of SAIRI Research Initiative, Prof. Dr. Aurangzeb Hafi and Professoe Emeritus Dr. Zaki urge the UN, international organizations, and the government of Pakistan to pay focused attention on the present pressing crisis of Tharparkar drought, that is causing a rapid increase in child mortality due to severe mal-nutrition. He also emphasized on ‘disability-inclusive and pregnancy-inclusive protocols’ in disasters management policy frameworks. Prof. Hafi is credited for pioneering the cutting-edge concepts of pre-birth multiple disabilities risk assessment, embryonic toxicity and teratogenic proneness factor analysis among pregnant women during Tsunami 2004, along with his fabled DESPO appraisals on disability+pregnancy inclusive special protocols in cataclysmic emergencies and DRR modus of pre-disastrous as well as post-disastrous phases.

The ‘Decade Summit of Asian Tsunami’ is scheduled to be concluded by the UNISDR-SAARC conjoint institutional stretch-term by 1/10/2015. The summit consists of 23 formal academic sessions, and 9 high-level round the table panel discussions. Recommendations are to be made to the governments and other quarters of relevance, on strategic as well as thematic issues like early warning system, emergency action plans, disaster preparedness and marginal groups inclusiveness schema-protocols.

556|Korean heiress arrested for 'nut rage'|"Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-Ah has reportedly been arrested for delaying a flight with a tantrum over snacks in a 'nut rage' incident that caused an uproar across South Korea.

Cho has been accused of forcing the chief purser off a December 5 New York-Seoul flight and of compelling the taxiing plane to return to the gate so she could disembark.

She had taken exception to being served macadamia nuts she had not asked for - and in a bag, not a bowl.

Cable news network YTN showed Cho as she was taken by prosecutors to prison late on Tuesday.

The 40-year-old kept her head low and said 'I'm sorry' as she left the building, broadcast footage showed.

The prosecutors' office had applied for an arrest warrant last week and this was finally granted by a court in Seoul late on Tuesday, the Yonhap news agency said.

Cho was charged with violation of the aviation safety law, coercion and interference in the execution of duty.

An unidentified KAL executive was also arrested on Tuesday on charges of destroying evidence from the incident.

557|Palestinian home torched in West Bank|"Suspected Israeli settlers firebomb home of a family, including five children, in south of occupied territory.

Suspected Israeli settlers have firebombed the home of a Palestinian family in the southern West Bank, causing extensive damage but no casualties, the village mayor and witnesses said.

Five children and two adults were in the house in Yatta, south of the city of Hebron, at the time of the attack, overnight on Wenesday, in which several incendiary devices were hurled into the property through a window.

Anti-Arab graffiti written in Hebrew near the property declared the attack had been ""revenge"".

Yatta mayor Mussa Mhamra condemned the ""racist crime committed by settlers who wanted to kill an entire Palestinian family"".



The attack bore the hallmarks of so-called ""price tag"" violence - a euphemism for nationalist-motivated hate crime by Israelis aimed at Arab property.

Such attacks began as a reaction to state moves against the settlements but have since escalated into a much broader expression of xenophobia.

Petition rejected

On Wednesday, an Israeli High Court rejected a petition to ban demolitions of homes belonging to Palestinians who havve carried out attacks against Israelis.

The propertues include the homes of Ghassan and Udai Abu Jamal, who killed five Israelis when they attacked a synagogue in November.

The court also temporarily froze the order to demolish the home of Palestinian Mutaz Hijazi who shot and wounded right-wing Israeli activist Yehuda Glick in October.

558|US-led Forces Launch 10 Airstrikes in Syria Iraq|"The U.S.-led coalition launched seven airstrikes in Syria and three in Iraq on Wednesday against Islamic State militants, the Combined Joint Task Force said in a statement.

In Syria, five of the airstrikes were near Kobani and two were near al Hasakah, the task force said in a statement. Two of the strikes in Iraq hit Islamic State positions near Fallujah and one hit targets near Mosul, the statement said.

Kurdish forces have regained control of around 70 percent of Kobani, a Syrian town near the Turkish border, after pushing back IS fighters, a group monitoring the war said Wednesday.

Backed by U.S-led airstrikes, Kurdish forces made significant advances overnight Tuesday after violent clashes with the IS group in the southern part of town, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Known as Ayn al-Arab in Arabic, Kobani has become a symbol in the fight between the extremist group and its enemies in Iraq and Syria. Hundreds of IS fighters launched a sustained attack on the town beginning in September.

U.S.-led coalition forces have bombed IS positions around the predominantly Kurdish town almost every day this month.

The Observatory, which gathers information from sources in Syria, said Kurdish fighters now control southern and central parts of the town as well as most of the west in an area stretching up to the border.

Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Observatory, said Kobani was the only clear example of U.S-led forces cooperating with fighters on the ground in Syria to push back the Islamic State.

""There are airstrikes every day. They have destroyed many Islamic State bases in Kobani. If there had been no airstrikes, then I think Kobani would have been controlled by Islamic State by now,"" Abdulrahman said. He added that Kurdish forces were close to controlling the entire town.

The United States has said it wants to train and equip ""moderate"" rebel groups to fight Islamic State on the ground elsewhere in Syria, but rebels say there is much uncertainty surrounding the plans."

Online programme to ensure toilets’ usage to be unveiled NEW DELHI



Prime Minister Narendra Modi is launching a nationwide online programme to check whether people are using toilets as part of his cleanliness drive.



From next month, officials will head out with mobile phones, tablets and iPads to report on whether toilets are being used in rural India, with results uploaded onto a website in real time.



India’s shortage of toilets costs the country more than $50 billion a year, mostly through premature deaths and hygiene-related diseases, according a World Bank study. India suffers a greater cost than other Asian countries from the poor collection of human excreta, the study found.



Since taking office in May, Modi has repeatedly lamented the poor state of sanitation and public cleanliness in India, vowing to solve the problems within the next five years.



The government has doubled spending on a toilet building programme and requested financial donations from some of the country’s largest companies to help.



“Earlier, the monitoring was done only about the construction of toilets, but now the actual use of toilets will be ascertained,” the government said in a statement on Wednesday.



“The ministry of drinking water and sanitation will launch a nationwide real time monitoring of use of toilets from January 2015... Earlier, the monitoring was done only about the construction of toilets, but now the actual use of toilets will be ascertained on a sustained basis,” it said.



Moreover, in order to implement the ‘Clean India’ mission in a mission mode, the ministry was being strengthened and around two dozen additional staff, including two joint secretaries and other officials will soon be appointed for effective implementation and monitoring of ‘Clean India’ goals.



An expert committee will also be set up to examine the innovative technologies for toilets and solid and liquid waste management, the release said, adding a national telephonic helpline will also be installed for rural water supply and sanitation.

The southbound lanes of Del. 1 north of Smyrna has been reopened after state police cleared a chicken-hauling tractor-trailer that caught fire Wednesday morning on the highway, detouring traffic.

The incident occurred about 11 a.m. when the rig’s driver Ralph I. Elsey, 62, of Seaford, was driving a 2006 Freightliner tractor-trailer loaded with live chickens south on Del. 1 north of Black Diamond Road, said Master Cpl. Jeffrey Hale.

A rear tire on the trailer blew out and sparked a fire, causing Elsey to pull the truck onto the shoulder and exit the truck.

Townsend firefighters responded and extinguished the fire. No one was injured.

All lanes of southbound Del.1 were closed for four hours and traffic detoured while the load of chickens were off-loaded to another tractor-trailer and the disabled rig was removed from the scene.

The highway was re-opened about 3:10 p.m.

562|Digital India will be a game-changer|"Digital India to me, is one of those visionary ideas that has the potential and depth to transform India. What excites me most about it is that it promises to fix a serious problem that has held India back. For years, we have been the IT hub for the world and our IT workers have solved some of the biggest technology problems worldwide, but we have completely ignored using that expertise to solve India’s own problems.

The cost of doing nothing has been very high! Finally there is a government that is doing something about changing it and as the industry, we should not be asking whether it can be done or not, but join hands to accelerate the execution and ensure we see the impact at the earliest.

According to a recent McKinsey report, the realisation of Digital India will help the country with 20-30% incremental GDP by 2025. The adoption of technology across key sectors like financial services, healthcare, agriculture, energy, infrastructure and education will provide an additional impact of $550 billion to $1 trillion on the India economy annually by 2025!

The numbers are mind boggling, but they can be achieved, especially as rapid pace of innovation is increasingly making technology more favourable for mass scale adoption, which is a must for the successful realisation of Digital India. The stars, as they say, are aligning well. What is needed now is an unprecedented focus and the will to make it happen across both government and industry.

Henry Ford once said that coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress and working together is a success. This could not be any truer for India than it is today. Realising such an important and enormous vision cannot be the government’s job alone. We have to be an equal partner in this journey.

The government has set the stage with a strong vision and an equally strong show of will to make it happen. What we need now is for them to focus on setting the right policy frameworks and processes that make it easy for industry to do business in India and encourage us to participate in India’s journey towards becoming a digital India. The government must encourage open global standards that will enable India to benefit from the best technology worldwide and continue to champion the cause with unwavering political will.

Broadly, there are three key parts to Digital India; building a robust secure infrastructure, growing an ecosystem to develop customised solutions for citizens across hardware and software and developing the right skill sets for technology innovation and usage. Our recommendation to the government would be to set up PPP forums in each of these segments to invite industry to participate in areas where they have the domain expertise and interest.

The National Digital Literacy Mission is a classic example of a robust PPP that’s delivered impact at the grassroots. Launched by Intel and Nasscom in 2012, the initiative brought together several industry players on a common platform to accelerate digital literacy in the country. To date over 3 million citizens have been trained and one member in every household in the first three panchayats to receive NOFN is e-literate.

The department of electronics and information technology, having seen the benefits of this programme has fully adopted it to drive scale especially given the importance of widespread digital literacy in India.

The one area where this kind of a model is needed with a high level of urgency is in developing the culture of innovation in India. For the impact of Digital India to be realised, we have to use technology to solve problems faced by Indians and for that we need a very strong culture of grounds-up frugal innovation in IT.

The Government’s ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ philosophy encapsulates the importance of collaboration and the time is right for both sides to make it happen because irrespective of the challenge, the cost of inaction is far too damaging for not just the business but the nation at large.

564|State's unemployment rate hits new six-year low : suburban journals branding|"Gov. Pat Quinn recently announced Illinois’ unemployment rate fell to its lowest point in more than six years, according to a press release.

Last month, the state’s jobless rate fell to 6.4 percent, its lowest point since June 2008 and lower than when the governor took office. In addition, the state added 2,300 jobs in November, for a total gain to approximately 300,000 jobs since the economic recovery started in February 2010.

“Our economy is continuing to grow and create more jobs, and that’s good news this holiday season,” Gov. Quinn said. “Illinois’ improving economy is a reflection of the tough decisions we’ve made over the last six years.”

Since taking office in 2009 and inheriting a massive financial crisis due decades of mismanagement and the worst recession since the Great Depression, Gov. Quinn has made Illinois a better place to do business by enacting major reforms to lower the cost of worker’s compensation and unemployment insurance. He also has achieved unprecedented reforms in pensions and Medicaid while slashing state spending to historic lows. The governor’s tough actions have helped stabilize the state’s finances and paved the way for more economic growth.

The governor has led progress in Illinois’ manufacturing sector, a core part of the economy that supports service jobs and goods that are shipped worldwide. The governor invested $16 million to launch the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute on Chicago’s Goose Island. The institute is a venture of UI Labs that will connect manufacturers to the latest tools and knowledge.

Other major Illinois businesses have thrived under the governor’s leadership such as Chrysler’s Belvidere plant, where the job total has gone from 200 to 4,500 since the governor took office. Over the same period at Ford’s plant on the south side of Chicago, operations have grown from one shift and 1,600 workers to three shifts and 5,100 workers.

The governor has also continued his support for small businesses by investing in Illinois’ entrepreneurship community. He has invested a total of $8.8 million to assist the 1871 technology incubator and the MATTER medical technology hub, both in Chicago’s Merchandise Mart. In its first two years, 1871 and its spinoff companies have accounted for more than 1,000 new jobs.

Gov. Quinn’s administration has aggressively recruited businesses to Illinois and negotiated agreements involving hundreds of new jobs with such companies as eBay, the Federal Savings Bank, MillerCoors and Nippon Sharyo USA. In October, Gov. Quinn announced Amazon.com was shipping to Illinois and creating 1,000 new jobs and a $75 million investment in the state.

The state’s comeback has been highlighted from numerous publications and research organizations such as Site Selection magazine, which in 2013 named Illinois third among the states in its number of corporate relocations and expansions. Illinois has also continued to lead the Midwest in net business growth. In addition, the University of Illinois Flash Index rose again in November to 106.6, up for the fourth straight month. The index is a weighted average of Illinois growth across corporate earnings, consumer spending and personal income.

Illinois worker’s wages are currently the ninth-highest in the country, outranking all neighboring states. Wage growth is one of the key indicators in judging economic growth according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."

The middle-aged man was at the Klovsk station when the accident occurred.

The embarrassing tumble left Sozonov with a fractured skull and blood streaming down his face.

“We don't make the barriers very high because we hope that people will respect the need to pay for the service,” Kiev metro operator spokesperson Leo Aksakov said. “It's more of a symbolic gesture just to remind people more than anything else.”

Security staff who witnessed the incident recorded it and then released the video footage to the public as a warning to other fare dodgers.

“It seems that even a symbolic gesture was too much for this man, who we hope will think twice before attempting to avoid buying a ticket, and serve as a warning to others,” Aksakov said.

According to Aksakov, Sozonov was unconscious for 10 seconds following his stunt.

566|Maharashtra Police to investigate 'PK' content|"Aamir Khan's latest film ""PK"" is facing protests by right-wing Hindu outfits for being anti-Hindu and on Tuesday Maharashtra police has been ordered by the state government to investigate its content.

It is learned that the police has been asked to check whether the film has objectionable content; which apparently insult Hindu gods.

Sources in Maharashtra's Home Department say a senior police officer, Deven Bharti, has been tasked with investigating the dialogue or scene in 'PK' and find out if the film really hurt religious sentiments which could lead to law and order problems.

Cities like Bhopal, Ahmedabad and Agra, have seen protests against ""PK"" in the past few days. In Mumbai, many theatres were forced to cancel shows fearing vandalism by groups like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal.

For his part, film's director Rajkumar Hirani defended his work, saying: ""I'm deeply saddened and concerned about the protests by some groups against our film. On behalf of the entire team of PK, I would like to clarify that we respect all religions and faiths.

Meanwhile, the film fraternity has expressed disappointment over the government's decision, saying it undermines the authority of the Censor Board.

The film released on December 19 and had earned over Rs. 250 crore in India so far."

569|Parents of wrongfully executed teen in China to get $330,000|"By Sui-Lee Wee

BEIJING (Reuters) - The parents of a Chinese teenager executed 18 years ago for the rape and murder of a woman he did not commit will get 2.05 million yuan ($330,491) in compensation, a court and his father said on Wednesday.

This month, a court exonerated Huugjilt, saying he was wrongly convicted in 1996 of raping and killing a woman in a public restroom. He was executed in the same year. He was 18.

Huugjilt is the latest wrongfully convicted death-row inmate exonerated in the past year. In August, Nian Bin, a former death row prisoner, was freed after a court said there was insufficient evidence against him.

These cases, which have sparked an outcry, have added to public discontent over wrongful punishment. They come as the government has embarked on legal reforms, including banning the use of torture to extract confessions.

Huugjilt's father, Li Sanren, said the compensation was ""all right"", adding that he and his wife ""respect the decision of the law and the state"".

""Our main consideration was his vindication,"" Li told Reuters by telephone. ""As for how much we should be compensated, that's a decision by the state.""

Li said he would use the money to find a good cemetery plot for his son.

The Inner Mongolia High Court said it was compensating Huugjilt's parents for the ""extremely serious mental damage"" that has been inflicted on them.

Many Internet users said they did not think the compensation was adequate and called for the officials responsible to be punished. The decision to compensate Huugjilt's family was the most talked-about topic on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter.

This month, authorities said they were investigating a senior policeman for his role in Huugjilt's case.

Huugjilt's parents had been petitioning judicial authorities since 2006 to re-try the case. Another man had confessed to the murder in Inner Mongolia in 2005, but a retrial was not conducted until this year.

The recent exonerations have raised concern about irreversible miscarriages of justice.

Anti-death penalty campaigners say China, which does not announce the number of people executed, uses the death penalty in far more than other countries.

While wrongful executions have stirred public outrage, capital punishment has wide public support.

570|Uber prices to surge during New Year's Eve|"New Year's Eve: the day to overpay for everything from that glass of flat Champagne to the impossibly-high heels you'll wear just once, to, once again, that ride home from Uber.

The ride-hailing app expects this New Year's Eve to be its busiest night ever. Due to high demand — and because it can — Uber is bringing back its surge pricing, a boon to its drivers but a bane to passengers. Fares can increase sevenfold or more during the busiest time of the night, which Uber says will be between 12:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.

To avoid spiking fares, Uber suggests booking a ride right after the ball drops at midnight, or wait until after 2:30. The app will notify users in advance if surge pricing is in effect, and full-price estimates are given before requesting a ride.

In addition to partying at home, taking public transportation or a cab, however, there are other options for revelers who, for whatever reason, think better of driving on New Year's Eve.

Riders who use rival Lyft will also see a version of Uber's price surge, called ""Prime Time."" The feature is turned on when ride requests ""greatly outnumber available drivers."" How much extra you'll pay, Lyft says, depends on demand. To check the rates, tap the Prime Time icon on the bottom right side of the app's home screen.

Flywheel, a much smaller competitor, is counting on sticker shock from surge pricing to win ever customers this year. From 8 p.m. on Wednesday until 3 a.m. on Thursday, the company is offering $10 rides in San Francisco, Seattle, Sacramento and San Diego, as long as the metered fare does not exceed $50. Rides that go over $50 will be charged the metered balance, the company says.

A service called BeMyDD (that's designated driver) lets you reserve a driver who will drive your car home for you in case you are intoxicated. Two drivers will pick you up, one to drive your car and the other to give your driver a ride once you have arrived home safely. Pricing can vary depending on your location. In Palo Alto, California, for example, it's $25 for a car pickup, plus $3.75 per mile.

Both Uber and Lyft are donating a portion of their New Year's hail to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Uber will donate $1 from every ride when users enter the promotional code ""MADDNYE"" on booking a ride. Lyft will donate $1 for everyone who makes a ""pledge"" to get home safe by visiting Lyft.com/NYE."

Missing climber Michael Bishop.

Three climbers missing on Aoraki Mount Cook for three days are presumed dead, police say.

Australian man Michael Bishop, 53, and German father and son Johann and Raphael Viellehner, aged 58 and 27 respectively, were last seen on Linda Glacier on Monday morning.

Police said two helicopters had been searching the area this morning in vain and it was believed the trio perished on the mountain.

Facebook Raphael Viellehner, a 27-year-old German, is one of the three climbers missing on Mt Cook.

""The situation is grim,"" police said.

""It was hoped that if they had survived the storm they would have been spotted from the air today.""

The three men's families had been advised that they were probably dead.

Three climbers are missing on Mt Cook.

Further aerial searchers would take place over the next few days to find their bodies. The Christchurch based search and rescue team had returned home and Department of Conservation searchers were on standby.

About 30cm of snow had fallen at Plateau Hut, where the trio had set out from on Monday.

Senior Constable Brent Swanson said they were expecting the worst.

""If they were up and moving we would have seen them today.

""It was beautiful conditions this morning ... they were very good for searching.""

The final helicopter sweep was happening this morning as it flew back to Christchurch with volunteers, he said.

Department of Conservation Mt Cook Search and Rescue team leader Jim Spencer said they had flown above the terrain this morning searching for signs of life.

"" We flew above because it provides higher visibility ... we were looking for anything out of the ordinary, splashes of colour, movement, anything that was unusual.""

Swanson said the area would continue to be monitored and there was a number of operators in the area who were also keeping a ""look out"".

Chief guide Dave McKinley said searcher were disappointed with the news, and people in Aoraki/Mt Cook village were ""feeling for the family members of the people involved"".

McKinley, who took part in the search, said New Year's Eve and New Year's Day had historically been ""very bad days"" on the mountain, as they fell in peak climbing season.

If the climbers are confirmed dead, the number of deaths in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park would total 238 and the number of deaths in 2014 would total five, the greatest number of people to die in the national park since 2008, when six people perished in separate accidents.

Department of Conservation summer mountaineer Stu Haslett was the last person to die on the mountain after falling on December 13.

A Mt Cook memorial books list 234 confirmed deaths on Aoraki/Mt Cook national park.

CLIMBERS 'EXTREMELY FIT'

Raphael Viellehner was a talented runner and had completed numerous competitive races.

Johann Viellehner had significant climbing experience and had climbed in parts of Europe, including Russia.

Bishop had previously climbed peaks in the Aoraki/Mt Cook National Park.

Bishop was understood to be a GP in Brookvale, Sydney.

Staff at his former clinic described him as an avid climber.

Bishop was also a pastor at a community Christian organisation he founded called Ascent to Life.

Bishop's eldest son Joshua said his family was praying for his father's return.

""It's devastating. We're missing him but we are supporting each other and preparing ourselves to go to New Zealand and bring him home.

""If he's not here on earth he's in no more pain.""

It was Bishop's third attempt at climbing Mt Cook, his son said.

""He really wanted to do Mt Cook. He'd tried two times before but bad weather stopped him before he reached the summit.""

The experienced climber told his son on Christmas day he would try Mt Cook again.

He had not planned to climb with the Viellehners but after meeting them at Plateau Hutt, they had decided to summit together.

Joshua Bishop was confident his dad was prepared with the right gear.

He had started climbing as a medical student 30 years ago.

""One time he got caught in a big snowstorm and he made an igloo and survived.""

He said climbing was a spiritual experience for his father.

""He always encouraged people to go hiking and experience the joy of being on top of a summit.""

Ascent to Life posted on its Facebook page asking people to pray for the missing climbers.

""Please pray for the safe return of our dear Friend, Pastor and Founder of this ministry, Dr Michael Randall Bishop,"" one person posted.

Strong winds during a cold winter storm blew several big rigs onto their side alongside a Southern California freeway Wednesday morning.

At least five big rigs toppled on the Foothill (210) Freeway in Fontana and Rancho Cucamonga between 4:30 and 7 a.m., according to the California Highway Patrol.

Aerial video showed at least three on their sides near the interchange of the 15 and 210 freeways in Rancho Cucamonga as of noon.

Officials had to drag the trucks off the roadway so drivers could move through. One big rig driver suffered minor injuries, CHP officials said.

Snowy SoCal Winter Wonderland

The windblown big rigs came hours after snow stranded more than 100 motorists in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles."
579|Deadly inferno in Vietnam tailor shop caused by sewing machine: police|"Cambodian authorities on Wednesday refused a request for asylum made by nine Vietnamese Montagnards who had traveled to Phnom Penh to ask for help, and whose presence in the country had previously gone unreported.

The nine arrived in the capital on Sept. 30, but were turned away by the Ministry of Interior, which refused to register their names, a U.N. rights officer posted to Cambodia told RFA's Khmer Service on Thursday.

""OHCHR was alerted to the arrival of nine new asylum seekers yesterday requesting assistance,"" Wan-Hea Lee, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) representative in Cambodia wrote in an e-mail.

""I understand that they were also refused registration by the Refugee Department, as have all others who crossed over this year,"" she wrote.

The group, which had traveled to the capital from northeastern Cambodia's Ratanakiri province, had earlier told local contacts they feared being returned to Vietnam, where they said they face political persecution, one Ratanakiri villager said.

""The Vietnamese authorities are cracking down just now,"" the villager said, adding that another Montagnard, traveling alone, had entered Ratanakiri on Sept. 28.

""They are being persecuted. The Vietnamese authorities want to arrest some of them, and some of the others were just recently released.""

Chhay Thi, Ratanakiri provincial coordinator for the rights group Adhoc, confirmed that the group had been present in the area for at least a week and said he had told U.N. representatives of their request for help.

Disputed status

Cambodian authorities maintain that the nearly 200 ethnic Montagnards who have crossed into Cambodia from Vietnam's Central Highlands since late last year are not political refugees, but farmers who have entered the country for economic reasons.

In mid-July, a dozen Montagnards who had sought refugee status in Cambodia willingly returned to Vietnam after Hanoi gave assurances it would not punish or discriminate against them. It is not known what happened to them after their return.

While turning away the Montagnards, a senior Ministry of Interior official told RFA on Thursday that Cambodia will accept as refugees two Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar currently detained by Australia on the small Pacific island of Nauru.

""We have seen their documents,"" Kem Sarin, head of Cambodia's Immigration Department, said, adding that immigration officials will travel to Nauru to interview the two asylum-seekers before they come to Cambodia.

""They have volunteered to settle in Cambodia, and after we speak to them we will return here to request permission from the government to accept them,"" he said.

In April, Cambodia granted asylum to an Iranian couple, an Iranian man, and a Rohingya Muslim from Myanmar who had sought asylum in Australia but were denied entry, being held instead for months in a camp in Nauru for refugees unwelcome in the country.

In exchange, Australia promised to pay more than U.S. $40 million in costs and aid to Cambodia, drawing criticism from rights groups who noted that Cambodia had forced asylum-seekers from China and Vietnam back home.

The Rohingya man later asked to be returned to Myanmar.

580|Hamilton's year in review: Health scares, crumbling schools and drug scandals|"HAMILTON — From health scares to crumbling schools and public employees’ drug charges, the Hamilton area remained in the news throughout 2014.

Hamilton was at the center of a national health crisis in late September when Eli Waller, a 4-year-old preschooler at Yardville Elementary School, died in his sleep from enterovirus-68, the first death in the United States directly attributed to the virus.

In the weeks after his son’s death, Andy Waller announced the start of the First Day of School Foundation, which will fund supplies and tuition for special education students in Hamilton and beyond.

“Eli benefited greatly from his teachers and after-school activities, and it’s the mission of the foundation to provide financial support for students in a similar situation,” Waller said in October.

Unlike enterovirus-68, a December case of hepatitis A diagnosed in a food service worker at Rosa’s Restaurant and Catering went by without much fanfare.

The township recommended hepatitis A vaccines to any recent customers of the popular S. Broad Street restaurant, holding two clinics for residents.

SCHOOL NEWS

In a continuing situation rom 2013, the school board this year began making plans to address nearly $227 million in facilities issues across all 24 schools.

Superintendent James Parla in November said the board’s space and enrollment committee would likely try to draw up a $20 million referendum to address emergent and ADA noncompliance issues before focusing on the possibility of building new schools.

But when those projects advance, Parla won’t be around to see them: He submitted a letter of resignation in October and will resign from the district for personal reasons in January 2015.



The board will have new faces in the next year with the election of longtime PTA member Jennifer Kraemer and Rider University student Chris Scales.

“I just want to keep being involved, getting information from students and parents when I’m out and about,” Kraemer said.

“The voters wanted some new faces up there and I believe, come January, the new board members will do the right thing,” Scales said.

SCANDALS

Two public employees this year lost their jobs after getting involved, to different degrees, with marijuana.

In September, 29-year township employee Joseph Fratticcioli was arrested when officers from the Mercer County Narcotics Task Force found more than $38,000 worth of marijuana at his township home.

And while she was not arrested, it was what an arbitrator called “a disjointed version of street justice” that cost Steinert High School student assistance coordinator Loretta Young her position in June.

The district filed tenure charges against Young in January 2014 after learning that she had allegedly brokered and failed to report a marijuana transaction between two students in her office as a way to calm tensions between the two, arbitrator Michael Pecklers said.

NEW DEVELOPMENT

Throughout the year, development continued on major projects, including some that drew fire from critics.

The township zoning board in March approved a “super” Wawa gas station and convenience store on Route 33, the first step in redeveloping the long-vacant Patterson Chevrolet dealership.

But the project is at a standstill due to a lawsuit filed by local BP gas station owner Walter Steele, who has argued that the new Wawa gas station would put his and many other stations out of business, creating more blight in the busy economic corridor.

And in the North Crosswicks area of town, the Diocese of Trenton has proposed a cemetery and mausoleum on a vacant piece of South Broad Street farmland, opposed by neighbors who believe it would upset the rural character of the area.

In Robbinsville, two major projects went live after years of construction.

The 1 million-square-foot Amazon.com warehouse finally opened in July and has since hired more than 1,000 employees.

In August, thousands were on hand to dedicate a new traditional stone mandir, only the sixth in North America, at the Robbinsville chapter of BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Sanstha.

“This will add to the cultural, moral, sculptural and architectural landscape in the community,” BAPS volunteer Yogi Trivedi said.

And after 30 years, Allentown residents finally heard the Historic Farmers National Bank clock ring after undergoing renovations by Eden Organic Salon & Spa, which occupies the building.

“It was something old and broken that is now clean, shiny, and working like new,” said Eden Organic Salon & Spa owner Catherine Chamberlain.

581|Foreign Policy Transformation In Hungary “Reaches Halfway Point”|"“The world has changed a lot and this means Hungary’s foreign policy must change both institutionally and in its approach,” the minister, who entered office in late September, said.

The government has already carried out the biggest change, namely integrating the institutions overseeing external economic relations and cultural diplomacy into the foreign ministry’s structure, he said.

All institutional conditions are now in place for Hungary to achieve its goals of taking a leading position in the EU in terms of the export-GDP ratio and the contribution of industry to the national economy. Hungary can also now assume poll position in central Europe in terms of per capita direct foreign capital investment, he said.

Szijjártó said that Hungary should pursue a pragmatic foreign policy. No one blames the United States for maintaining close economic cooperation with China or any western European nation for fostering good ties with countries in the Far East, he said.

Yet cooperation between China and central Europe is a target of criticism even if China’s trade turnover with the 16 CEE countries falls short of its trade with Italy, he argued.

Szijjártó said it was regrettable that the South Stream gas pipeline project had been scrapped. Hungary now needs to find new sources to ensure the security of its energy supplies, he said, and reiterated that the Hungarian - Russian deal on upgrading the Paks nuclear power plant fully complied with the EU regulations, there would be no need for any EU interference.

Szijjártó said that one should not expect the policy of eastern opening to yield spectacular achievements overnight. He added, however, that Hungarian exports to China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Turkey, Macedonia, Serbia, Egypt and Morocco had increased.

Opposition Together politician Nóra Hajdú said the government should stop its “rampage in foreign policy” seen over the past few months. The transformation outlined by Szijjártó should be stopped in its tracks in order to prevent “further failures” from narrowing Hungary’s room for manoeuvre in foreign policy.

She said Fidesz leaders had adopted a “shocking” tone in their recent statements about the United States. Hajdú insisted Szijjártó was not fit for the job of foreign minister and should resign.

VoA - News Wednesday 31st December, 2014

Researchers in Britain have discovered a protein that plays a role in the spread of lung cancer. The finding could lead to a therapy to prevent cancer metastasis, reducing cancer deaths.

Experts say nine out of 10 people who die of cancer do so because of metastasis, the process in which cancer cells travel through the bloodstream or lymph system to establish new tumors that are hard to treat. So, finding a therapy that prevents the spread of cancer could improve survival.

Researchers at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, part of the University of Manchester in England, have discovered a protein, TIAM1, that keeps cells from migrating but becomes defective in lung cancer. The disease is one of the world's leading causes of cancer death.

When cancer undermines TIAM1, ""the bonds holding the lung cells together are more easily broken apart, and the cells can move away more easily and move around the body,"" said Emma Smith, a spokeswoman for the institute.

Smith said the spread of cancer, to places such as the brain and liver, leads to organ failure and death.

Researchers are now trying to develop a treatment to bolster the action of TIAM1. The work is in its early stages, Smith said, but the goal ""is to design a therapy to target this molecule, to restore its function, and this would actually stop lung cancer spreading. [Cancer cells] would remain docked at the primary tumor.""

An article describing TIAM1 and its role in cancer metastasis is published in the journal Cell Reports."
585|End inhumane and damaging wolf hunt|"Use of dogs, leg traps for hunting are barbaric, and courts were right to stop hunt.

Wisconsin’s wolf hunt was recently halted by a federal judge. It’s time to end it for good. (Photo: Getty Images)

Wisconsin's third wolf hunt recently ended, with a body count of 154 wolves — down from 250 the year before. Since federal protections for this species were rescinded in 2012, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has overreached and allowed an inhumane and reckless trapping and trophy hunting program to be implemented.

Thankfully, on Dec. 19 a federal district court ruled that state management is flawed and hindering wolf recovery, and sport hunting and trapping of wolves in the Great Lakes region must end. Wolves in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin once again are federally protected — restoring protections that wolves and people lived with for nearly four decades.

In the short two and a half years since wolves were stripped of their protections under the Endangered Species Act, trophy hunters and trappers killed more than 1,500 Great Lakes wolves — principally in Wisconsin and Minnesota — under hostile state management programs that encouraged dramatic population reductions. Last month's federal court decision recognized that state wildlife managers have not been responsibly handling their authority and their ""unregulated killing"" plans have impeded the recovery of wolf populations.

Wisconsinoutdoorfun.com: More news on the 2014 wolf hunt

Durkin:Wolf endangered species ruling defies biology

Among the Great Lakes states, Wisconsin stands apart in managing its wolf population with exceptionally unsporting and barbaric methods, including leghold traps, cable snares, baiting, electronic calls and packs of dogs — with hounding of wolves so out of the realm of responsible action that it's drawn condemnation around the nation.

Since the state took over management, authorities have intentionally driven down the size of the population, by allowing the killing of so many wolves that packs have been crippled or even wiped out in some cases. During the last three hunting seasons, more than 520 wolves were killed — and nearly 70 percent of them were taken with cruel and indiscriminate leghold traps.

At the start of the first wolf hunt in 2012, our state counted its wolf population at 770; since that time the population has suffered a 15 percent decline. The DNR's plan was to drive the population to 350 wolves, a drastic and mind-boggling reduction that could have only been achieved through an even more intense killing plan.

For several years now, state wolf management has been based entirely on fear and rhetoric, rather than science and conservation. The plain truth is that wolves pose no legitimate danger to people. In the exceptionally rare instance that a wolf threatens human safety, lethal control of wolves is already allowed, just as it has been for the past 40 years.

Wolves in Wisconsin (Photo: Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)

Wolf-caused mortality of livestock in our state is minimal, and can be managed through non-lethal measures — which we now know is the most effective mitigation path. In fact, a recent peer-reviewed study out of Washington State University, which used more than 25 years of data, demonstrated that lethal control of depredating wolves does not work; in fact, such measure may result in a greater loss of livestock by disrupting pack social relationships and allowing more surviving wolves to breed. Random killing of wolves, ironically, may result in more problems for farmers and ranchers.

Weather and respiratory infections are the leading causes of cattle mortality in the U.S., and those few ranchers that lose a cow or two to wolves are compensated by state reimbursement programs that have existed for decades to insure them against such losses.

Our DNR's 2014 survey of nearly 9,000 residents revealed that a vast majority believe that wolves ""balance nature"" and should not be ""harvested"" for their fur by trappers. It is time now to heed the wishes of Wisconsinites, and this latest federal court ruling, by protecting wolves from further trophy hunts and finding the right balance on the issue of wolf management.

586|First International phone numbers to be reassigned|"By Shelley Shan / Staff reporter

The National Communications Commission (NCC) yesterday said that telephone numbers assigned to bankrupt First International Telecom would be reassigned to 4G service operators, adding that it would help the company’s users migrate to new telecoms under the number portability policy.

The personal handy-phone system (PHS) operator was declared bankrupt by the Taipei District Court on Monday.

The service has about 600,000 subscribers and only 100,000 of them are still paying fees.

NCC spokesperson Yu Hsiao-cheng (虞孝成) said the company has until Monday next week to appeal the court’s ruling.

“If it becomes clear that the company will not be able to continue operations, the commission will have to cancel its license to offer the PHS service, as well as the license to use the frequency,” Yu said.

Yu said the government had previously appropriated 2 million mobile phone numbers for First International, which would be taken back as well, adding that they would be reassigned to five 4G service operators: Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan Mobile, Far Eastone Telecommunications, Asia-Pacific Telecom and Taiwan Star.

“We hope that subscribers of First International can continue using their telephone numbers and can find services that suit them the most,” he said.

Some of the telecoms have expressed concerns on taking over customers from First International, as many were exempt from paying monthly fees and pay only the communication charges.

Founded in 1997, First International introduced the PHS service in 2001.

It promoted the service as a low-power system that produces fewer electromagnetic waves.

The service was widely used by healthcare professionals working in hospitals, as the use of PHS phones does not disrupt medical equipment.

The number of PHS system users reached its peak in 2005, but it soon declined after other telecoms introduced cheaper service plans and mobile Internet services gained popularity.

The NCC allowed First International to upgrade to a more advanced PHS system last year and approved its construction plan last month.

It also allowed the company to pay the license fee, as well as the frequency use fee, in installments to help ease the carrier’s financial burden.

The company’s license is valid for 15 years and is scheduled to expire on April 16 next year, the commission said."

588|Libya containing Es Sider oil fire but export resumption in question|"BENGHAZI, Libya - Libya has made progress containing a fire at its largest oil port that has destroyed four days of the country's oil production but the damage to storage tanks will hamper efforts to resume exports, officials and industry insiders said.

The fire at Es Sider, the country's main oil export terminal, has been blazing for a week and is a visible indication of the destructive violence that threatens to tear the country apart almost four years after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.

The North African country is in the middle of a power struggle between two opposing governments -- the internationally recognized authorities in the east and rivals who have seized power in the capital -- that are vying for control of Africa's biggest oil reserves.

Both sides command forces made up of former rebel troops which helped oust Gaddafi but which are now fighting each other since a group called Libya Dawn took Tripoli in August, forcing the recognized prime minister, Abdullah al-Thinni, to flee to the east of the country.

Fighting this month reached an eastern region known as the oil crescent, which is home to the country's biggest export terminals, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, forcing their closure and depriving Libya of at least 300,000 barrels a day of oil production.

Last week, a rocket hit an oil storage tank at Es Sider as a force allied to the Tripoli government made a new push to take the ports. A fire -- for which both sides blame each other -- has damaged seven tanks and destroyed up to 1.8 million barrels of oil, four times Libya's daily output.

The shutdown of the two ports is a blow to Libya's already crippled public finances as the central bank has been burning through its dollar reserves to keep the country afloat. Oil output has slumped to around 380,000 bpd, a fifth of what Libya used to pump before the 2011 uprising and insufficient to fund the budget.

NO BUDGET

From next week, the country will not have a budget as neither of the country's rival parliaments has agreed on a new one. Spending has been kept to a minimum by the central bank, which is trying to stay out of the conflict.

Libyan firefighters managed to extinguish fires at five storage tanks, leaving only two ablaze, Mohamed El Harari, a spokesman for state oil firm NOC, said.

JACKSON, Tenn. -- 2014 will be a year for the record books. While the year itself was wet and colder than average, several months out of the year were extremes.



We had the wettest June on record with more than a foot of rainfall, which is nearly eight inches above the average. We also had one of the coldest Januarys, Februarys, Marches and the coolest Julys ever recorded. It was another year of no readings in the triple digits. The last time Jackson saw 100 degrees was a period of nine days in 2012.



In addition to the unseasonable weather, we had a relatively quiet severe weather season. Warnings were down again with a total of 400 tornado and severe t-storm related warnings issued. Feb. 20 was our first run in with severe weather for the year, which brought wind damage across southern portions of McNairy and Hardin counties along with a brief tornado in Hayti, Mo. A number of homes and buildings suffered structural damage, making it the earliest active day for severe weather here in the Mid-South. April 27 and 28 will be days many of our viewers will remember.



A notable day in weather history for the Tuscaloosa Tornado in Alabama proved to be an infamous day yet again with numerous tornadoes across the Southeast. It produced quite a bit of damage as well as numerous fatalities in Arkansas and Mississippi. We even saw an EF-2 tornado right here in West Tennessee that went undetected by radar, giving residents of Union City little warning. Luckily, a local skeet shooting class spotted the tornado as it got closer to Union City, leading to only one injury before the storm became stronger as it crossed into Kentucky.



June, however, was by far our most active month for severe weather. Numerous tornado warnings as well as severe thunderstorm warnings were issued with a confirmed tornado on June 8 that crossed over from New Madrid, Mo., into rural portions of Obion and Lake counties. The VIPIR 7 Storm Team was with you for it all, staying on the air for more than eight hours to keep you and your family ahead of these destructive storms.



Flooding also became an issue as June became the wettest month on record for West Tennessee, creating numerous sinkholes and damage to crops around the region. The last instance of severe weather was Oct. 2 and 13 when almost 700 reports of severe weather were recorded. The most notable were the unconfirmed reports of tornadoes in Obion and McNairy counties. Both areas were surveyed by Weather Service crews the following day. There were power outages that lasted about a week along with 80 mph-plus winds that damaged trees and homes.



On the other end of the spectrum, the 2014 Atlantic Hurricane season was quiet with eight named storms. Hurricane Arthur was the only land-falling hurricane to strike the U.S. this year. Arthur brought numerous flash flooding concerns, damaging winds, high surf and even six tornadoes to the coastal Carolinas before moving up the coast into the major cities.



The second day of 2014 gave us our first true taste of winter with icy conditions taking aim at West Tennessee. On Jan. 2 and 28, we saw a dusting of snow that even reached as far south as Savannah, causing trouble on roadways. The worst of winter weather came back on March 3 and 4. A massive ice storm wreaked havoc on West Tennessee, dumping anywhere from five to nine inches of sleet leading to numerous power outages, impassable roads and school closures.



With 2015 just around the corner, we already have seen our fair share of extremes. Before Thanksgiving, portions of Lake County saw up to two inches of snow with even a dusting here in Jackson. More cold air is on the way though for the New Year ahead. So prepare now and stay with the VIPIR 7 Storm Team for the latest on the ever changing weather right here in West Tennessee.

PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota's Department of Game, Fish and Parks plans to ask the Legislature to approve $11 million in debt for improvements to resort facilities at Custer State Park.

The state would pay off the bonds over 15 years with a 4 percent increase in the annual franchise fee paid by the private company that operates the state-owned facilities, Game, Fish and Parks said in a statement. Custer State Park Resort Co. currently pays a 10.4 percent franchise fee on all gross receipts.

593|KBS World Radio|"Anchor: Among South Korea’s key economic policies for 2015, one of the noteworthy changes is the further opening of the South Korean labor market to foreign manpower.

Our Bae Joo-yon has more on the government’s plans to invite more outstanding talents from abroad amid the decline in the nation’s working age population.



Report: In its economic policy directions for 2015, the government focused on revamping the nation’s economic structure and in particular, raising the flexibility of the labor market.



For this aim, the government plans to improve its visa system in a bid to actively attract foreign manpower through what it calls “human FTAs.”



Amid a decline in the nation's working age population, the government will expand the scope of its point-based immigration system in granting permanent residency, or F5 visas.



Under the plan, foreign workers who have resided in South Korea for only a year will be eligible for permanent residency if they earned high enough scores in consideration of their age, education, income and Korean language ability.



The revision would allow easier immigration to South Korea as the government currently grants F5 permanent residency for those who stayed in the nation for three years with F2 residential status issued to qualified expatriates.



The government also plans to eventually put into place a point-based system for the current E1 to E7 work visas to allow foreign masters- and doctoral-degree students in South Korean universities to reside in South Korea with their parents.



The government will expand academy-industry liaisons, ease job qualifications and extend job-hunting periods.



Such moves by the government come amid criticism that its employment permit system for foreigners, first introduced ten years ago, has failed to appropriately utilize foreign workers and only focused on securing foreign manpower with simple skills.



Lee Chan-woo, the head of the economic policy bureau at the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, said there are roughly one-point-eight million foreign workers in South Korea but that most of them carry out simple tasks. Lee said the government’s plans for 2015 aim to foster foreign talents in the mid-and long-term.



In a bid to devise and coordinate mid-and long-term immigration policies, the government will also boost the functions of the committee under the Prime Minister’s Office charged with managing and protecting foreign laborers.



In the Cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan is said to be strongly determined to pursue structural reforms in the labor market.

See all 21 photos » SAN DIEGO (CNS) - A cold storm from Canada saturated San Diego County early Wednesday, bringing heavy rain and snow to the region.



The National Weather Service scheduled a winter storm warning for heavy snow until 10 a.m. for valley, mountain and desert areas, saying the snow level would be around 2,000 feet.



A winter storm warning for heavy snow means severe winter weather conditions are expected or occurring. Significant amounts of snow can make travel dangerous, the agency said in its warning.



""Several inches of snow will fall in the mountains, and with temperatures well below freezing, roads will be very slick,"" the NWS said. ""Two to four inches of snow could fall at lower elevations ... including just east of Alpine.""



The California Highway Patrol overnight reported snow was sticking on Sunrise Highway and the sides of Interstate 8 in the area of Sunrise Highway. There was also heavy snow in Descanso and Crestwood Summit, according to the agency, which responded to an increased number of crash reports throughout the county this morning. Most of the crashes involved minor to no injuries.



The Weather Service also reported snow in the North County communities of Rainbow, Fallbrook and Valley Center.



The weather service said snow showers were likely to taper off from north to south this morning, but slick roads could continue into this afternoon. Next Article Breast Cancer Awareness month gets underway in San Diego"

598|Child kills mother with her pistol in Wal-Mart|"A 29-year-old woman described as a “beautiful, young, loving mother” was fatally shot by her 2-year-old son at a northern Idaho Wal-Mart in what authorities called a tragic accident.

The little boy reached into Veronica J. Rutledge’s purse and her concealed gun fired, Kootenai County sheriff’s spokesman Stu Miller said. The woman was shopping Tuesday with her son and three other children, Miller said.

Rutledge was from Blackfoot in southeastern Idaho, and her family had come to the area to visit relatives.

She was an employee of the Idaho National Laboratory, The Spokesman-Review of Spokane, Washington, reported. The Idaho Falls laboratory supports the U.S. Department of Energy in nuclear and energy research and national defense.

The woman had a concealed weapons permit. Miller said the young boy was left in a shopping cart, reached into his mother’s purse and grabbed a small-caliber handgun, which discharged one time.

Deputies who responded to the Wal-Mart found Rutledge dead, the sheriff’s office said.

“It appears to be a pretty tragic accident,” Miller said.

The victim’s father-in-law, Terry Rutledge, told The Associated Press that Veronica Rutledge “was a beautiful, young, loving mother.”

“She was not the least bit irresponsible,” Terry Rutledge said. “She was taken much too soon.”

The woman’s husband was not in the store when the shooting happened at about 10:20 a.m. Tuesday. Miller said the man arrived shortly after the shooting. All the children were taken to a relative’s house.

The shooting occurred in the Wal-Mart in Hayden, Idaho, a town about 40 miles northeast of Spokane. The store closed for the rest of the day.

Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said in a statement the shooting was a “very sad and tragic accident.”

“We are working closely with the local sheriff’s department while they investigate what happened,” Buchanan said.

Idaho National Laboratory senior chemical engineer Vince Maio worked with Rutledge on a research paper about using glass ceramic to store nuclear waste, The Spokesman-Review said.

Maio said he was immediately impressed with her.

“She had a lot of maturity for her age,” he told the newspaper. “Her work was impeccable. She found new ways to do things that we did before and she found ways to do them better.”

“She was a beautiful person,” he added.

There do not appear to be reliable national statistics about the number of accidental fatalities involving children handling guns.

In neighboring Washington state, a 3-year-old boy was seriously injured in November when he accidentally shot himself in the face in a home in Lake Stevens, about 30 miles north of Seattle.

In April, a 2-year-old boy apparently shot and killed his 11-year-old sister while they and their siblings played with a gun inside a Philadelphia home. Authorities said the gun was believed to have been brought into the home by the mother’s boyfriend.

Hayden is a politically conservative town of about 9,000 people just north of Coeur d’Alene, in Idaho’s northern panhandle.

Idaho lawmakers passed legislation earlier this year allowing concealed weapons on the state’s public college and university campuses.

Despite facing opposition from all eight of the state’s university college presidents, lawmakers sided with gun rights advocates who said the law would better uphold the Second Amendment.

Under the law, gun holders are barred from bringing their weapons into dormitories or buildings that hold more than 1,000 people, such as stadiums or concert halls.

599|Why the Palestinians Joined the International Criminal Court|"The Palestinian Authority's President Mahmoud Abbas signed the papers to join the International Criminal Court a day after it was denied statehood by the UN’s Security Council. The provocative move could draw sanctions from Israel and the United States, as well as expose the Palestinian territories and Israel to an international investigation of war crimes.

On Tuesday, Jordan, acting on the Palestinian Authority's behalf, failed to secure enough votes to pass a motion in the UNSC that would have set a deadline to end Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. On Wednesday, Abbas ratified the Rome Statute—which governs the International Criminal Court—thereby opening Palestinian Authority territory to ICC investigations. The Hague-based court has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.

It was not immediately clear what the Palestinian Authority would do at the court, and a 60-day waiting period must elapse before it can file any cases. While the court has 122 members, major countries like the United States, China, and India are not participants. Neither is Israel, and there are limits to the body’s power, as The Washington Post reports.

In a sign of the court’s limitations, prosecutors were forced earlier this month to abandon a case against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who had been charged with orchestrating a 2007 campaign of ethnic violence. Though Kenya is a member of the court, the government refused to cooperate with the prosecution and blocked investigators from gathering sufficient evidence to continue the case.

Moreover, ICC prosecutors have significant leeway on which investigations they decide to move forward, and an investigation of Israel would face strong political pressure from its allies. The Palestinian Authority's joining could lead to the prosecution of Israeli officials for war crimes and crimes related to Israel’s settlement activity. In 2009, the humanitarian group Human Rights Watch accused Israel of committing war crimes in a 2008-2009 conflict known as “Operation Cast Lead.” The charges included launching missile attacks that killed civilians, the killing of 11 civilians holding white flags, and the use of white phosphorus munitions in densely populated areas.

The Palestinian Authority sought redress at the ICC in 2009 for those tactics. The ICC prosecutor ruled that the Palestinian Authority did not have the right to make investigation requests because it was not a non-member observer state at the UN. The Palestinian Authority later won that status. In September 2014, after the most recent conflict, Human Rights Watch accused Israel of committing war crimes by killing 45 Palestinians who were taking shelter in a “well-marked” UN school.

Israel is expected to take retaliatory action, possibly including cutting off tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority, revoking VIP traveling status for Palestinian officials, announcing new settlements, or taking legal action in other jurisdictions. Members of the U.S. Congress have previously promised to cut off U.S. aid if the Palestinian Authority moved to join international bodies like the ICC.

""The Security Council has let us down. Where shall we go?""

Tuesday's failed resolution for UN statehood would have set a one-year deadline for negotiations with Israel, established a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, and called for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank by the end of 2017. The resolution needed nine votes from the 15 member body; it garnered eight, with the United States voting against, Britain abstaining, and France, China, and Russia among those voting in support. Some questioned why the resolution was pushed forward now—in January, a rotation will bring to the Security Council new countries, like Malaysia, which might have proved more likely to vote in favor. Abbas, who has been under strong domestic political pressure, may have pressed for a vote now to avoid forcing a U.S. veto—and the confrontation a veto would bring.

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power explained the U.S.’s vote in a firm statement: ""In short, the Obama administration believes unilateral action or moves to join international bodies are not productive and will not create a durable peace, and prefers a negotiated peace process between Israel and Palestine. Comprehensive peace talks, brokered by Secretary of State John Kerry, reportedly collapsed earlier this year in part because of Palestinian negotiators’ insistence on joining various UN treaties and conventions, although continued construction of Israeli settlements also played a role. Secretary Kerry had sought to delay the statehood push to avoid inflaming tensions in Israel ahead of the country’s March elections.""

Speaking from his headquarters in the West Bank after signing the ICC papers, Abbas referenced the UN failure. “There is aggression practiced against our land and our country, and the Security Council has let us down — where shall we go?”

600|Down with the flu? Youre not alone|"Down with the flu? Youre not alone

Buffalo Business First Thursday 1st January, 2015

(file photo)

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared the flu an epidemic this season, with outbreaks in nearly every part of the country.

In Western New York, doctors say there has been a massive spike in cases. In some hospitals, like Millard Fillmore Suburban, doctors and nurses are working overtime to try and handle the large number of cases.

""We've had a huge surge,"" Dr. David Pierce told WKBW-TV. ""It's across the entire system so everyone is being hit very hard this time of year with influenza.""

Dr. Pierce works at Millard Suburban and is used to seeing flu cases over the holidays. ""Right now, we are in what would normally be one of the highest peaks for influenza in general,"" Dr. Pierce said.

But, this year, numbers really stand out. According to the Erie County Department of Health, reported flu cases jumped nearly 130 percent in the past week.

That could be attributed to the flu vaccine, which is not effective against common strains of the flu this year. But the county is still urging the public to become vaccinated since the shot will prevent strain B, which doctors say often spreads in March.

Patients suffering from influenza are often prescribed Tamiflu, but that is in short supply at some area pharmacies. Doctors say some large pharmacy chains are out of the drug and patients should try locally-owned pharmacies to see if they have any in stock.

601|York-Hanover's unemployment rate dropped to 4.8 percent in November, a more than 6-year low|"Rate is the lowest since July 2008

York-Hanover's unemployment rate dropped to 4.8 percent in November, the lowest level in more than six years, as area employers continued to add jobs amid an improving economy.

The region's jobless rate shrank from 5 percent in October and improved from 6.6 percent in November 2013, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry reported Tuesday.

York-Hanover's unemployment rate was the lowest since the region saw a 4.7 percent jobless rate in July 2008 and ""more of a sign that the economy in the area continues to do better,"" said Scott Meckley, an industry and business analysis manager with the Department of Labor & Industry in Harrisburg.

York-Hanover's November unemployment figure was lower than Pennsylvania's 5.1 percent and the U.S. rate of 5.8 percent.

The unemployment rate has dropped locally over the past 12 months because more people are finding work, Meckley said. That's unlike earlier periods of decline when the rate fell because people stopped looking for work, so they weren't counted in the unemployment statistics, Meckley said.

York-Hanover led Pennsylvania in non-farm job growth in November adding a seasonally adjusted 2,400 jobs since October for a total of 179,300 jobs. But much of the increase came from Exelon Corp.'s hiring of more than 1,000 temporary workers to perform maintenance and upgrades at the company's Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station in Peach Bottom Township, Meckley said. He expects to see a corresponding drop in the number of jobs upon the completion of the work there.

In addition to the temporary workers at Peach Bottom, who are counted in the mining, logging and construction sector, employers also added 800 jobs in retail trade in advance of the holiday shopping season.

At Bear Staffing Services in York Township, client companies are doing more business, so they are looking to hire more temporary workers in manufacturing, warehousing and production, said Christopher Acuna, a staffing specialist with the company, which fills jobs in York, Lancaster and Cumberland counties.

""It's been a very busy time,"" Acuna said.

One regular client, a York County manufacturer, has in recent years hired temporary workers from September to November. This year, the company, which Acuna declined to name, hired more than 30 workers — twice as many as last year — and kept them on through Christmas Eve, he said.

Acuna expects strong demand for temporary workers continuing into 2015.

""I think it's going to be pretty steady for the first half of the year,"" he said.

York-Hanover's jobless rate fell to 4.8 percent in November, the lowest since July 2008.

The region gained a seasonally adjusted 2,400 non-farm jobs since October. It was the biggest gain in jobs of any region in Pennsylvania.

Here are the sectors that added the most jobs and those that lost the most from October to November:

• Mining, logging and construction: up 1,000

• Retail trade: up 800

• Transportation, warehousing and utilities: up 200

• Education and health services: up 200

• Professional and business services: down 100

• Wholesale trade: down 100

• Leisure and hospitality: down 100

604|Middle East Online|"ABU DHABI - The Million Street Al Dhafra Festival, it is, for 2 weeks of the year, one of the world’s most expensive roads. Despite being an unpaved dirt “street”, with no high brow brand boutiques, this is where transactions of millions of Dirham are happening, hence its name, the Million Street.

Starting from nearby the arena where the camel beauty show takes place, the road goes on for several kilometres into the desert. Some of the Arab Gulf’s prettiest camels walk its path, beautifully dressed up in gold and silver covers as they go to or return from the camel competition. Their owners and keepers are always with them, driving around in four wheel vehicles, music blasting and occasionally dancing around the camels if they won one of the top places in the camel “mazeyna” (beauty) contest.

To one side of the Million Street, camel camps stretch as far as the eye can see. Usually, each camp has a large tent majlis for receiving guests, flanked by the flags of the country of the owner. Emirati, followed by Qatari and Saudi seemed to make the large majority of campers.

“Camping at Al Dhafra Festival is free of charge. Camel owners have to register first, then they are allocated a space, but they don’t have to pay for anything. Even camel food and fire wood they receive at discounted price,” said Abdullah Butti Al Qubaisi, Director of Projects Management at the Cultural Programmes and Heritage Festivals Committee – Abu Dhabi, organizer of Al Dhafra Festival.

Some camel owners spend only a few days at the festival, returning home after their round in the camel competition is over, others stay for the full 10 days of the festival, enjoying the desert life and the great weather.

“We have everything here. At the back of the majlis there are tents for sleeping, and even kitchen and bathroom. The festival gave us a water tank and we have some water pumps to make running water. Look, I even have TV here in the majlis; we don’t like to watch TV in the desert, but I brought it for the kids, who mostly play games on it,” said Mohammed Al Dhaheri, who came here all the way from Saudi Arabia with 20 of his black camels.

Hamed Al Obaidy has his family camel farm only 60 kilometers away, in Liwa, but he is camping in Al Dhafra with 12 of his 60 red haired Asayel camels.

“It’s beautiful here! It is like going back in time, the way the Bedouin life used to be. We are sitting with friends, sharing news, we cook here and at night we warm up by the fire with karak,” he said.

One of Hamad’s camels just gave birth here, at the festival, and he decided to name the new born baby “Dhafra”, in honour of the festival.

“Someone offered me AED 5000 for the baby Dhafra, but I will not sell it under AED 7000,” he pointed out.

Camels, especially young ones, are often sold at high prices at the festival, used for food for people camping here, since the nearest market is about 30 kilometers away.

The festival will end on January 1 with a sour milk competition and the impressive Bayraq camel beauty competition, where the best looking group of 50 camels will win their owner AED one million!"

The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has invited terminal operators to bid to be a concessionaire of the first phase of the second container terminal at the Port of Mombasa.

Phase 1 of the US$300m project, scheduled for completion in February 2016, will comprise two main container berths with lengths of 210m and 300m and depths of 11m and 15m respectively.

By 2016 the new terminal, which is funded by a soft loan from the Japanese government, will have a capacity of 450,000 teu and this will rise to 1.2m teu by 2019.

Phase 2 will be implemented between 2016 and 2019 and Phase 3 is scheduled from 2020 to 2023 while according to KPA managing director Gichiri Ndua, the first phase is currently 70% complete.

The facilities and equipment to be leased to a concessionaire include container berths 20 and 21, wharf aprons of the same berths, a container yard, a railway yard, two ship-to-shore (sts) gantry cranes and four rubber tyred (rtg) gantry cranes.

The official tender document states that the Kenyan government and the KPA are looking for an “experienced container terminal operator” to “provide the country with a more competitive and productive port”.

Kenyan newspaper, The Standard, has reported interest from operators, DP World, and Bollore Logistics Africa (BLA).

In July, President and CEO of BLA, Dominique Lafont, said: “We have been in Kenya for 45 years and have been interested to run Mombasa on a concession for a long time. I had thought about it as far back as 15 years ago”.

Regarding Phases 2 and 3, the tender invitation added: “Discussions on funding options are ongoing and it is envisaged that the winning bidder of Phase 1 will be given first right of refusal to operate Phase 2 and/ or 3 depending on the financing option.”

However, if discussions with the concessionaire of Phase 1 are unsuccessful, the KPA “reserves the right to tender out the remaining phases”.

The first phase is funded by a Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

Container volumes in Mombasa grew by 11.5% in the first half of this year to over 460,000 teu, with typical products handled including fuel and consumer goods imports and tea and coffee exports for Kenya’s neighbouring landlocked countries."
607|Sri Lankan activists, including FMM secretary, assaulted during civil society event|"This statement was originally published on freemediasrilanka.wordpress.com on 22 December 2014.Free Media Movement condemns the attack by a government politician and his cadres during the 'Vidiye Wirodhaya' event held in Hambantota on 21 December 2014. A group of civil society organizations under the banner 'Viyaruwata Erehiwa, Jeewithaya Wenuwen' (Against Rage, For Life) came together to build a common voice to demand democratic reforms and speak out against the current government's anti-democratic activities.FMM also demands that the government take tangible action to prevent any future attacks, threats and intimidation by mobs, under the leadership of government politicians, aimed at suppressing peaceful voices of citizens during this election period.This attack is a gross violation of the freedom of expression of Sri Lankan citizens and a barrier to a free and fair election.The attack was allegedly carried out by Hambanthota Mayor Eraj Fernando who rose to fame due to the ""toy pistol"" controversy. Britto Fernando, Jayathilaka Bandara, Philip Dissanayake and the Secretary of the Free Media Movement Sampath Samarakoon were among those that were attacked and threatened by these seemingly government sponsored goons. Mr. Jayathilaka Bandara, Mr Prasanna Fernando and Mr. Sampath Samarakoon were hospitalized due to injuries caused by the thugs.""While we were protesting in front of the main bus stand in Hambantota, Mayor Mr. Eraj Frenando armed with a pistol and cut-throat razors attacked us around 10:10 am. It was 10:25 when we called 911. Around 3:30pm when we went to the Hambantota police station to make a complaint, they told us that they had not been informed about the incident by the emergency unit,"" Mr. Sampath Samarakoon said.Executive Director of CaFFE, Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon, in the CaFFE Election Report 41, stated that ""Elections are only a part of political rights and currently the right of holding an opinion, the right to expression, the right to campaign peacefully and the right to free movement of opposition activists are being constantly violated. These [activists] have protested many regimes but it was the first time in recent history that they were assaulted like this.""It is clear that various groups of government supporters constantly attack journalist and civil society activists who are in any way seen to be critical of the government.We demand that the government, and especially the Sri Lanka Police Force, enforce law and order, and act against these government politicians who are trying to unlawfully obstruct public movements, and to safeguard the freedom of association and freedom expression of the people of Sri Lanka.We also urge the Election Commissioner to take the necessary actions to ensure a free and fair election, and create an atmosphere free of violence and intimidation for a free and fair election that demonstrates a truthful public opinion.We request all people who value law and peace to join hands against these attacks."
608|Yemen suicide bomber kills 33 at Shiite celebration|"SANAA: A suicide bomber dressed as a woman killed 33 people in central Yemen on Wednesday when he blew himself up at a celebration by Shiite militia supporters, medical and security sources said.

Dozens of people were also wounded in the attack in the mainly Sunni but Huthi militia-held city of Ibb, the medics said, warning that the death toll was likely to rise.

Yemen has been dogged by instability since an Arab Spring-inspired uprising forced longtime strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh from power in 2012, with Shiite Huthi rebels and Al-Qaeda seeking to fill the power vacuum.

Among those wounded in Wednesday’s attack was Ibb governor Yahya Al-Aryani, who was attending the Huthis’ commemoration of the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, a medic said.

A security source told AFP that the bomber had been wearing a woman’s black abaya and veil when he detonated his suicide belt.

Another bomb was discovered at the entrance to the event’s venue, the source added.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen branch of the jihadist organization, has pledged to fight the Huthis, who overran the capital Sanaa unopposed in September and have since advanced into other, mainly Sunni districts, including Ibb.

AQAP military chief Qassem Al-Rimi vowed in November to carry out fierce attacks against the Shiite militia, and several deadly bombings targeting Huthis have been claimed by the jihadist group.

Al-Qaeda has also carried out a spate of attacks against the security forces from its strongholds in the south and east in recent weeks.

In the southern province of Shabwa on Wednesday, unidentified gunmen killed police officer Col. Mohamed Al-Nessi near the provincial capital Ataq before fleeing, a police source told AFP.

There was no immediate claim for the shooting but last weekend AQAP claimed an attempt to assassinate a top general in an ambush that killed two soldiers and wounded 11.

In a second incident, AQAP said its gunmen opened fire on an army colonel in central Baida city, killing him instantly.

And on Tuesday unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle shot and killed an army officer in the southern port city of Aden.

AQAP is considered by the United States to be the global jihadist network’s most dangerous branch and its attacks on security forces have challenged Yemen’s longtime role as an effective ally in Washington’s fight against extremists.

Its proximity to oil-rich Saudi Arabia and key shipping routes in the Gulf of Aden have also raised fears that it could become a failed state similar to Somalia.

The US slapped sanctions on former president Saleh in November for allegedly supporting the Huthi advance.

It also blacklisted two Shiite rebel commanders, Abdullah Yahya Al-Hakim and Abd Al-Khaliq Al-Huthi, “for engaging in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen.”"
609|Scottish Ebola case triggers Save the Children investigation|"Save the Children has launched an urgent investigation into how a Scottish nurse contracted the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone, as health chiefs promise to review screening measures in the UK.

The charity’s humanitarian director, Michael von Bertele, said he had ordered an inquiry into whether Pauline Cafferkey caught the disease outside the treatment centre in Kerry Town where she had volunteered.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “I would say that protection, if people adhere to the protocols, is of a very high standard but … nothing is risk-free, particularly when dealing with a disease like Ebola.”

He said the investigation had started already.

“It’s really important for us to try and understand whether it was a failure of training, of protection, of procedure, or indeed whether she contracted it in some incidental contact within the community, because our workers don’t just work inside the red zone, which is a very high-risk area, they do also have contact - although we are very, very careful in briefing people to avoid personal contact - outside of the treatment centre.”

Cafferkey, from Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, contracted the virus while carrying out a five-week volunteer placement for Save the Children. She returned to the UK on Sunday night and told officials at Heathrow she felt unwell but was allowed to catch a British Airways flight to Glasgow.

The 39-year-old was diagnosed with Ebola the next morning and is receiving specialist treatment in a high-level isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital in London. A spokesman for the hospital declined to comment on her condition on Wednesday morning, but said an update would be issued in due course.

Dr Martin Deahl, a fellow NHS volunteer who returned to the UK with Cafferkey, told the Guardian that she almost certainly would have contracted the virus outside the treatment centre, which has strict protocols to protect staff and patients.

“I’m sure she did [contract it] outside the treatment centre,” he said. “I can’t imagine that anyone following the procedures and protocols in the treatment centre would have contracted it.”

Save the Children runs an 80-bed treatment centre in Kerry Town, which is believed to be where Cafferkey was based. A spokeswoman for the charity confirmed that it has volunteers working at the facility but could not say whether they were from the UK or whether more NHS health workers were due to fly out.

The Department for International Development said it expected more volunteers to be trained and deployed in the coming weeks. A DfID spokeswoman said a team of 25 travelled to Africa on 6 December and a dozen medics flew out on 21 December.

The chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, conceded that the case raised questions over Ebola screening precautions.

“We regularly keep under review what we are doing because this is a new process,” she told ITV’s Good Morning Britain.

“Clearly, queuing and things like that are unacceptable and we will review. But we will let people who are well travel because they will not infect the public.”

She said Cafferkey had been well. “She had no symptoms. Her temperature was within the acceptable range. She would not be transmitting the virus, therefore she was cleared as fit to fly.”

A Department of Health spokesman said: “We have been clear – this person was tested as part of the screening process at Heathrow and, as with all health workers, she was advised to contact PHE [Public Health England] if she had any concerns. She did this while still at Heathrow and went through a further six temperature checks.

“Her temperature was in acceptable ranges and she was cleared for onward travel, with the advice that if she did start to feel unwell, she should contact health authorities.

“After this person got home, she alerted health authorities that she was experiencing symptoms and was admitted to hospital for tests. Naturally, we will be reviewing what happened and the screening protocols, and if anything needs to be changed it will be.”"
610|The Source Weekly - Bend, Oregon|"The day before Christmas Eve was a typical winter day: Dozens of kids careened down the sledding hills at Wanoga Sno-Park, screaming with excitement while parents snapped pictures.

But, starting on New Year's Day, there will be a new dimension added to the activities at the popular park: Fat bikes will officially be welcomed.

Increasingly over the past several years, riders of so-called ""fat bikes""—mountains bikes with massive, monster truck-style tires—have rolled onto some of the favorite trails for Nordic skiers and snowmobilers throughout Central Oregon. But with the increasingly popularity, so has intensified the question where to put all the bikes and bikers.

Gary Meyer with the Central Oregon Trail Alliance (COTA) estimates there were around 150 fat bike riders in the area last year, up from approximately 30 just three years ago—roughly a five-fold growth spurt. Others put the number even higher, around 200 local riders.

But the sport has not been without turf wars. Just like snowmobilers and backcountry skiers, traveling at different speeds and with different attitudes, they occasionally quibble over who should be allowed on which trails. Riders of fat bikes are late-comers to the party—but are quickly working to figure out where their bikes can smoothly fit into the flow.

Most notably, a working group led by COTA came up with a viable solution: On January 1, it will open nine miles of singletrack snow trails branching out from Wanoga Sno-Park, specifically designated for Bend's booming new cyclist population.

""One of the big goals with these trails was to reduce conflict,"" Meyer says, sitting on a barstool in his kitchen. He has a wiry black-and-grey beard that hints at his outdoor lifestyle. Meyer says the trails are set to open in January for a two-month trial period to which the U.S. Forest Service agreed.

""What Gary's doing is great because it's gonna give us as fat bikers our own zone that we can ride in without creating any kind of conflict,"" says Mason Shannon with Bend Cyclery.

Zach Casper at Webcyclery underscores the need for specifying these trails for fat bikes. ""I'd much rather be on a singletrack with a fat bike,"" says the avid cyclist and skier. ""Riding a fat bike down a groomed Nordic trail is like riding a really cool road bike down a landing strip. It's so wide that it's boring. It's not a challenge."" This year's Desert Orthopedics Great Nordeen race on January 31 has added a 15 k fat bike race, starting at Mt Bachelor and running to Wanoga Park."
611|Central Africa: Angola's Great Lakes Engagement Praised|"Luanda — The US special envoy for the Great Lakes Region and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC), Russell Feingold, Tuesday in Washington highlighted Angola?s contribution to the pacification of that region of the African continent.

Russel Feingold was speaking at a video-conference from Washington, saying that since Angola took up the presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), the country has been dealing with matters concerning latent conflicts in some countries of the African sub-region.

He stated that the Angolan president José Eduardo dos Santos, the Defence and Foreign ministers and other Angolan officials are showing a great desire to help settle the Great Lakes problems

The diplomat expressed the United States' gratitude to Angola for its leadership of the ICGLR.

Russel Feingold recalled that the two countries recently had an excellent bilateral dialogue which improved their relations, with good perspective for a strengthened partnership with Angola, particularly within the UN Security Council.

The US diplomat reiterated his country's readiness to support the effort of the leaders from the region in the search for peace and prosperity for their peoples, with a view to regional development.

The current situation in the DRC, troubled by an internal armed conflict, is characterised by assassinations and violations by the rebel forces of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).

This rebel group that has agreed with the UN Peace Mission (Monusco) to disarm and confine its troops is still to fulfill the accord.

In July this year, the ICGLR and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) issued the FDLR a six-month moratoria to peacefully and voluntarily surrender. The deadline will expire on 2 January 2015.

The ICGLR and SADC released a communique on October 20, vowing military actions, against the FDLR, as decided by the heads of State and Government, should the rebel group fail to meet the 2 January 2015 deadline."
612|Islamic State ask on Twitter how to kill captured Jordanian pilot|"SEOUL - Asia's largest movie festival kicks off Thursday at a time when the region's influence on the global movie industry is on the rise.

Entering its 20th year in the South Korean port city, the Busan International Film Festival saw its influence and size expand in stride with the growth of box office sales in the region.



Asian countries fueled growth in the global film industry last year, while box office sales in the U.S. and Canada declined. With box office sales of $12.4 billion in 2014, the Asian region is the biggest and fastest-growing movie market in the world, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.



Despite the growing influence of Asian cinema in the world, the non-competition movie festival has kept its bar of pretense and hierarchy low, unlike the historic yet hierarchical Cannes Film Festival, which turned away some women in flat shoes from a premiere this spring.



Busan cinemagoers - in flats or heels, part of the media or not - do more than just gaze at award-winning directors, K-pop stars and Hollywood celebrities gracing the red carpet. They happily stay in queues from the wee hours to get tickets, ask questions to filmmakers and actors after screenings, and join public talk shows with them on the beach.



While the glamor and glitz will not be lost in Busan, most moviegoers and industry officials will travel to South Korea's second-largest city to discover the next-generation Wong Kar Wai or Ang Lee. The festival's New Currents section, which premieres Asian feature movies from novice directors, has broken major talents, including Venice Film Festival Golden Lion winner Jia Zhangke. Its Asian Cinema Fund program has provided financial lifelines to promising filmmakers.



""There are a lot of movies completed by support from the Asian Cinema Fund, introduced in Busan for the first time in the world and then went on to international acclaim,'' said Kim Jiseok, the Busan Film Festival's executive programmer.



The festival has not been without challenges during its 20-year ride. The most recent setback was the budget cut by South Korea's government after the festival went ahead with the screening of a controversial documentary last year despite pressure not to.



The state-run Korean Film Council cut its support to the film festival this year by nearly half to 800 million won ($677,000) from 1.46 billion won ($1.2 million). Many viewed the budget cut as punishment for the festival's decision to screen the documentary, which was about the 2014 sinking of a ferry that left hundreds of people dead, most of them South Korean students on a school trip, and the government's much-criticized rescue operation.



""I felt then that our society's democracy had a long way to go,'' Kim said.



After the standoff with the government, Kang Soo-yeon, an award-winning actress, was appointed the festival's co-director. She has since vowed to stand for the value of freedom of expression.



After its opening on Thursday with ""Zubaan,'' an India coming-of-age drama, the festival will screen 303 movies from 75 countries, including 94 world premieres.

People attend the opening ceremony of the Busan International Film Festival at Busan Cinema Center in Busan, South Korea, Oct. 1, 2015.









The glamor and glitz will be at its height when the A-listed celebrities walk the red carpet under the futuristic roof of the Busan Cinema Center on Thursday evening. The center's 85-meter (280-foot) -long roof displays moving images on its curvy metal surface, with lights beaming from hundreds of thousands of LED lamps. It provides what has become the festival's key image since its completion in 2011, as well as the official poster image this year.



An equally impressive list of movie stars is expected to walk the red carpet. From South Korea, iconic actress Jeon Do-yeon, who served as the Cannes Film Festival's feature section jury last year, will make an appearance. Heartthrobs Jung Woo-sung and Lee Jung-jae are expected to impress K-pop fans, while actress Tang Wei, who commands big followers in South Korea, will return to Busan on the first day of the festival.



A legion of veteran Asian filmmakers will gather to celebrate the festival's 20th edition as well. Chinese filmmakers Jia Zhangke and Hou Hsiao-hsien and director Johnnie To from Hong Kong are among those scheduled to join the opening ceremony. Silvia Chang, the veteran actress and director from Taiwan, is set to greet audiences as the head the New Currents section jury. Japanese director Kore-eda Hirokazu and Apichatpong Weerasethakul from Thailand are among those expected to be spotted on the streets of the harbor city, although their attendance at the red carpet event remains unconfirmed.



From Europe and the U.S., Nastassja Kinski, the German model and actress, is set to attend the festival for the first time as part of the jury. Sophie Marceau, Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton, a frequent visitor to South Korea, will also be there.

From left, Indian director Mozez Singh, actress Sarah Jane Dias, actor Vicky Kaushal and actor Raaghav Chanana smile during a press conference for the Busan International Film Festival opening movie "" Zubaan"" in Busan, South Korea, Oct.1, 2015.





While Greater China, Japan and South Korea have been the preoccupation of the festival, this year's edition will see a rise of movies, actors and directors from outside East Asia. The co-host of the opening ceremony is Marina Golbahari, an actress from Afghanistan whose breakout role in the 2003 movie ""Osama'' gave her fame. Out of the eight movies competing for a prize at the New Currents section, four are from outside China, Japan or South Korea. The section dedicated to unearthing hidden talents of Asian cinema has selected directors from Iran, Kazakhstan and India, showing the rise of emerging filmmakers beyond East Asia.







A special section of the festival will feature a rare chance to watch black and white movies from South Korea made in the 1960s, when the country saw a sudden surge in movie making and watching. ""The DMZ,'' by the late director Park Sangho, is more than a work of historic importance. It is the first movie that was shot in the demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas, depicting the country's division through the eyes of two children. ""The Body Confession'' and ""The Door of the Body'' describe the lives of prostitutes.







Many Asian movies to be premiered at this year's festival mirror angst toward society's hyper-competitive system or raise questions about society's treatment of those who are left behind. ""Reach for the Sky'' is a documentary that takes a rare look at the lives of South Korean high school students before and after they take the crucial college entrance exam that is believed to determine one's success in life. The fictional drama ""4th Place"" is a story of a teenage swimmer who is beat by his coach to improve his record and his mother who overlooks violence in favor of a better score. ""Collective Invention,'' inspired by the Hwang Woo-suk scandal and his rise and fall, touches on various subjects, including youth unemployment and skewed media coverage.



A number of movies this year bring their focus to the life and death of the elderly in Asia. ""Ashes to Ashes'' is a South Korean documentary about a man who holds funerals for those without any family. ""Radio Set'' tells a story of an old Indian man whose attachment to an analogue radio causes friction with his son."

614|Canadian Mass Murder Claims 9 Victims|"Nine people, including seven adults and two young children, were found dead at three separate crime scenes in what Edmonton's police chief on Tuesday called the city's worst mass murder.

Chief Rod Knecht told a news conference the killings were the result of domestic violence. The victims included a woman found Monday night by officers who were responding to a weapons complaint at a south Edmonton home.

The bodies of three more women, two men, a boy and a girl were discovered a few hours later in the northeast part of the city where officers had checked on reports of a depressed, suicidal male earlier in the evening.

None of the victims was identified, but Knecht said the public was not in danger.

""It is a tragic day for Edmonton,"" he said. ""This series of events are not believed to be random acts. These events do not appear to be gang-related, but rather tragic incidents of domestic violence.""

A man matching the description of the suicidal male was found dead in a restaurant in the Edmonton bedroom community of Fort Saskatchewan on Tuesday morning, Knecht said.

""Our homicide investigators have established associations and linkages between these homicides,"" he said.

Police would not elaborate on the connection between the deaths.

""It's a really complex case involving multiple locations and police have yet to identity the suicide victim so police cannot yet say with 100 percent accuracy what the connection is,"" said police spokesman Scott Patterson.

In Edmonton, a western Canadian city of 878,000 people, mass murders are extremely rare. Knecht said the case was the worst mass killing in the city since at least 1956, when six people were murdered.

John Etter Clark, a provincial politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for four years, killed his wife, son, three daughters and an employee of their family farm before taking his own life in 1956. Clark had been suffering from frequent nervous breakdowns in the years before the killings."
615|A national New Year's resolution: reducing our debt|"NEW YORK CITY, New York - The United States was joined by just two other major countries on Thursday in backing Israel in its bid to block a UN resolution to allow Palestine to fly its flag alongside other countries at the UN headquarters in New York.



Australia and Canada sided with the U.S. as Israel made its case for the vote to be defeated.



Israel was also able to muster the votes of 4 tiny Pacific island nations which have a combined population of 204,000 in support of their bid.



When the votes were counted on Thursday night the result delivered a crushing blow to the U.S.-Israel grouping. Of the 193 UN member states, 119 votes were in favour, or almost two thirds of the vote, while 8 countries voted against. 45 countries abstained.



The four tiny Pacific nations that regularly side with Israel at the United Nations and voted against the resolution included Tuvalu, a Polynesian island nation in the Pacific Ocean, which has a population of 11,000 people; the Marshall Islands, a designated associated U.S. state. It is also located in the Pacific Ocean and has a population of 68,000 people; Micronesia, comprising thousands of small islands in the western Pacific Ocean with a population of 104,000; and Palau, a a designated associated U.S. state in the western Pacific Ocean, comprising a population of 21,000.



The landslide vote has infuriated Israel whose Ambassador to the UN Ron Proser on Tuesday tried to block the resolution from being tabled, arguing with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and General Assembly president Ron Kutesa that only member states should be allowed to fly their flags at the UN. He described the resolution as ""another cynical misuse of the UN by the Palestinian Authority.""



In a letter of complaint about the initiative to Ban and this year's president of the 193-nation General Assembly, Sam Kutesa of Uganda., Proser wrote: ""For 70 years the United Nations has raised only flags of full member states."". He called the move ""another cynical misuse of the UN by the Palestinian Authority.""



""As the gatekeeper of this institution, I call on you to reject this aggressive behaviour,"" his letter said.



The 45 nations that abstained from voting included the United Kingdom, whose Prime Minister David Cameron met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier in the day.



France, Ireland, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Luxembourg, Belgium, Malta and Poland however came off the fence to vote yes.



""It's a step to the recognition of Palestine as a full member state of the United Nations,"" Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah told reporters in Paris on Thursday.



A statement by the United Nations following the resolution said the text of the motion was that the decision is to be implemented within 20 days. The vote is for the raising of flags by non-member observer states. This will also include the Holy See (the Vatican) which too has non-member observer status.



The Vatican has issued no statement on the affair or its intentions to fly its flag, although it earlier asked to be removed from being a supporter of the resolution.



For Israel Thursday delivered three humiliating blows. The European Parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution requiring that products made in Israeli settlements carry labels that say so, and that Europe distances itself from that part of Israel where settlements are located in relations it has with the country.



""The root of the conflict is not the settlements,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement afterwards. ""We have historical memory of what happened when Europe labeled Jewish products.""



Meantime U.S. President Obama was able to garner sufficient votes in the Senate on Thursday to stop a vote on a resolution of disapproval against the Iranian deal, which had been vigorously opposed by Israel and its prime minister.



Mr Netanyahu this week has scaled back his rhetoric over the Iran deal as the likelihood of Obama having to use a presidential veto diminished. On Thursday following his meeting with David Cameron he was even talking about re-opening talks with the Palestinians.



""I'm willing right now, without any preconditions, any preconditions whatsoever, to sit down with President Abbas and negotiate this peace,"" he told a press conference. ""I'm willing to go to Ramallah or President Abbas can come to Jerusalem, or, for God's sake, we can take up some of these suggestions for retreats in Sicily or fjords in Norway, whatever. Anytime, anywhere, now, without preconditions.""



The UN vote on the adoption of the resolution to allow Palestine to fly its flag at the UN headquarters alongside those of the 193 permanent member nations was as follows:



Voting in favour of the resolution: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Chad, Chile, China, Comoros, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire,Cuba, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Fiji, France, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guinea, Guyana, Honduras, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Sweden, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe.



Voting against the resolution: Australia, Canada, Israel, Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Tuvalu, and the United States.



Abstaining from voting: Andorra, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, Latvia, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Monaco, Myanmar, Nauru, Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, South Korea, Romania, Samoa, Singapore, Slovakia, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Vanuatu.



Delegations not in attendance: Armenia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominica, East Timor, Eritrea, Georgia, Guinea Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe, South Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia.



The UN media centre reported that delegates considered various aspects of the resolution before adopting it. Calling it ""a historic vote"", the observer of the State of Palestine said that the General Assembly had sent an important message to the Palestinian people at a critical time. While raising the flag would not end the occupation, it would signify to Palestinian people everywhere that the international community supported them.



Israel's representative called the resolution a photo opportunity, cautioning that as long as the Palestinians believed they could achieve their political goals without making concessions, they would continue to avoid taking the difficult decisions needed for peace. Instead, he said, the photo truly worth taking was one of an Israeli Prime Minister and a Palestinian leader raising the flags of the two peoples living together in peace.



Many speakers stressed that the focus needed to be on a return to meaningful negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Germany's delegate cautioned against changing an established practice while the representative of Austria reminded the Assembly that many current Member States had had to wait till they ascended to full member status before their flag was raised at the United Nations. Bolivia's speaker said that although the vote was symbolic, symbols were important and the Palestinian flag would be a reminder of occupation and injustice.

China will consider all options when choosing the naval base for its aircraft carrier, said Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun on Tuesday.

""The aircraft carrier is not the stay-at-home type… It will need a home in the end,"" Yang said during an interview with Global Times.

Yang said elements like geography, the economy, and defense will be comprehensively evaluated and considered for building the aircraft carrier's base.

Speculations on the Internet said China will build two major bases in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province and Sanya, Hainan province, and two auxiliary bases centered in Qingdao, Shandong province.

China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, anchored for the first time at its homeport in Qingdao in Feb 2013.

She says the records -- which have sensitive information such as abortion details and Social Security numbers -- were discovered when her dog was on the warehouse property, tore up several files, and then dragged them outside. When she went inside, she discovered not only the records but containers of opioid drugs as well.Cedillo says the records were left in the warehouse by a now-estranged relative who works at an abortion clinic.

618|CNN's Hypocrisy Shines Through In Light Of Latest 'Scandal'|"CNN contributed to the atmosphere in which two New York City police officers were murdered last week. Then, it shed tears for the dead cops. Their contribution included their inaccurate and sensationalized coverage of police confrontations with black criminals. Now, CNN is moving on, as Republicans prepare to take over both houses of Congress. The new target: a top House Republican who associated with extremists.

CNN wants people to believe the GOP is racked by various New Year’s scandals, including that House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) spoke to a pro-white group in 2002. Scrambling to answer to the liberal media mob, Rep. Scalise is putting out various statements, such as that he didn’t know what the group was all about. He said he now finds the group’s pro-white views abhorrent.

But why hasn’t there been a smidgeon of attention on CNN for the fact that Democratic Rep. Danny K. Davis (IL) was honored at the Communist Party’s headquarters in Chicago for a lifetime of “inspiring leadership.”

The Davis “honor” was only two years ago, in 2012. Scalise spoke to the pro-white group 12 years ago.

Welcome to the world of liberal media bias.

Another difference is that Rep. Davis knew precisely what the event was all about. In fact, he was proud of being honored by communists. But that’s not a story, even though communism is still very much alive, having already killed about 100 million people. The North Korean regime, the subject of so much attention in recent days, is run by communists. So is Cuba.

Once again, for the umpteenth time, we are given a demonstration of the liberal media’s double standard. Associating with alleged extremists is only a problem for Republicans, not Democrats.

Republicans have to learn that being perceived as pro-white is wrong; being pro-black and/or pro-Red is fine. That’s why Republican Senator Rand Paul (KY) gets praise for meeting with racial agitator Al Sharpton to talk about “criminal justice reform.”

But speaking 12 years ago to a group started by David Duke, who wasn’t even at the event in question, is now a major scandal for the Republican Party, as defined by CNN.

Davis, of course, is given even more leeway because he is President Obama’s buddy. Davis and Obama were members of the Chicago New Party, a group designed to move the Democratic Party to the left. They appeared together to talk about their shared values.

Jeremy Segal, a disciple of the late Andrew Breitbart, produced a video of Rep. Davis being honored by the communists. No video of Rep. Scalise’s 12-year-old speech has yet surfaced. But it’s bad enough, from CNN’s perspective, that he apparently did speak to the group and that information about the appearance was dug up by a liberal blogger. This makes it a huge scandal.

The stench of the double standard is made worse by the fact that CNN employs cop-killer apologist Marc Lamont Hill as a paid contributor. Hill sings the praises of convicted terrorist Joanne Chesimard, who was involved in the “execution style” murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster. She fled to Cuba to escape justice. Hill’s Twitter page had once been plastered with police mug shot photos of the convicted terrorist. In one post, Hill praised the terrorist, saying she was “one of the great heroes in the black freedom struggle.”

The Scalise “scandal” is based on the allegation that he spoke to a group run by David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who was not even at the event and had “moved to Russia,” according to various reports. As we have noted, Duke now has connections to a Vladimir Putin adviser and apparently sees the Russian regime as the savior of white people worldwide.

Scalise ran the group of House conservatives known as the Republican Study Committee. Speaking of extremists, we noted in 2013 that Scalise failed to take a stand against the expansion of terror TV channel Al Jazeera in the U.S. He told us through a spokesperson that he “believes Al Jazeera has a First Amendment right to expand its broadcasts in the United States and that a congressional investigation of Al Gore’s deal with the channel is not warranted.” We had asked for his position on the deal when Gore was selling his stake in Current TV to Al Jazeera.

We noted, “By offering the First Amendment excuse in favor of the deal, Scalise is ignoring the evidence that Al Jazeera is not a legitimate news operation but rather a conduit for propaganda from terrorist groups, with whom it has intimate and ongoing relations.” We explained that, in the United States, it is against the law to provide material support to terrorists, with “material support” defined as including expert advice or assistance and communications equipment.

The deal went ahead because Rep. Scalise and other top Republicans, including Rep. Michael McCaul (TX), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, refused to investigate or hold hearings on the deal. We later found out that Al Jazeera and Qatar had hired Capitol Hill lobbyists to push the deal through.

Regarding the aforementioned Marc Lamont Hill, Fox News fired him as a paid contributor on the channel after we brought his extremist views to the attention of News Corporation executive chairman Rupert Murdoch. CNN didn’t bat an eye in picking him up as a commentator and contributor.

We noted that, on December 6, 2006, when reports indicated that Cuban dictator Fidel Castro was sick, Hill declared on his blog that he was afraid the information might be true. “My fears about Fidel’s health are not only personal but political,” he wrote.

Some of the more extreme material has been scrubbed from his site, but he still features a letter from Chesimard from an undisclosed location in communist Cuba. Chesimard declared, “I am 60 years old and I am proud to be one of those people who stood up against the ruthless, evil, imperialist policies of the U.S. government.” Hill commented, “Let us give thanks for her life and her sacrifice.”

This is apparently acceptable to CNN, which now pretends to honor the sacrifices of our police officers.

On her birthday, Hill tweeted, “Happy Birthday to Assata Shakur on her 67th Birthday. Wishing you 100 more years of love, struggle, and freedom.”

CNN has no problem paying an apologist for a cop-killer living under the protection of the communist regime in Cuba. But it will be on top of Scalise’s 12-year-old speaking engagement to a pro-white group as long as it thinks it can milk some ratings from the controversy.

But forget about CNN covering Danny Davis’s communist connection. If they raised that, they might have to take a look at Obama’s relationship with Rep. Davis—and another Davis, the one named Frank Marshall Davis, his communist mentor. And that is definitely a taboo subject.

How can these CNN anchors and commentators keep a straight face? Should we really take them seriously? Is acting like MSNBC one of their New Year’s resolutions?

619|Iran denies report that US offered to swap prisoners for jailed ex-Marine|"Iran has denied reports that Washington offered to trade Iranian prisoners for a former U.S. Marine jailed since 2011.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham says there has been no formal request to trade U.S.-held prisoners for Amir Hekmati, 31, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen born in Arizona, who was arrested in August 2011. The U.S. has also flatly denied the report and reiterated its call for Hekmati's release on humanitarian grounds.

Hekmati was convicted of spying for the CIA and sentenced to death. But earlier this year Iranian authorities reduced the sentence to 10 years in prison.

His lawyer, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, said Tuesday that Washington had delivered the proposal for the prisoner exchange through the Swiss embassy, which handles U.S. interests in Iran."

622|Anti-malaria drug combo boon for children: study|"Melbourne : A new drug combination therapy may help treat malaria in children, a new study has found, reports PTI.

Artemisinin-naphthoquine drug-combo should be considered for the treatment of children with uncomplicated malaria in settings where multiple parasite species cause malaria, according to Tim Davis from University of Western Australia.

Malaria is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that kills approximately 600,000 people every year. Several different parasite species cause malaria and in some settings, such as Papua New Guinea, two species, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, are responsible for the majority of malaria infections.

However, the two species respond differently to currently available anti-malarial drugs. The study compared the current recommended therapy for uncomplicated malaria in children in Papua New Guinea, artemether-lumefantrine, with a different combination therapy, artemisinin-naphthoquine.

Researchers used a randomised, controlled trial study design including 186 children with Plasmodium falciparum infections and 47 children with Plasmodium vivax infections. They found that artemisinin-naphthoquine was non-inferior to (no worse than) artemether-lumefantrine for treating Plasmodium falciparum but was more effective for treating Plasmodium vivax.

“The efficacy, tolerability, and safety of three daily doses of artemisinin-naphthoquine suggest that this regimen should be considered together with other currently available effective (artemisinin combination therapies) for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in (Papua New Guinea) and similar epidemiologic settings with transmission of multiple Plasmodium species,” researchers said.

The research was published in the journal PLOS Medicine."

THE ISSUE:

Too many gaps exist in ethics, lobbying and open meetings laws for local governments.

THE STAKES:

How can taxpayers have confidence in their leaders' decisions without closing such gaps?

On the eve of a new legislative session, the New York Public Interest Research Group released a report validating what news media and community activists have been saying for decades: State laws to help foster honest, open local government are lacking.

NYPIRG started looking into the operations of local governments that would most likely be affected by hydrofracking, investigating whether citizens could have confidence that those governments would make decisions publicly and with their residents' desires at heart.

More Information To comment: tuletters@timesunion.com or at http://blog.timesunion.com/opinion

While the hydrofracking issue was rendered moot with the Dec. 17 announcement that the drilling process won't be allowed in the state, the message of ""Drilling Down: Local fracking decisions highlight failures in New York's municipal ethics laws"" remains relevant.

NYPIRG reported it found:

The state's ethics laws fail to ensure decisions by local municipalities are free of conflicts of interest.

The state's lobbying law contains a gaping secrecy loophole: Exempting reporting for municipalities with fewer than 50,000 residents.

The state's open meetings law contains gaps that can be used to deprive the public of timely notice of agenda items and access to pertinent documents.

Some small local governments lack the financial resources, infrastructure, expertise and personnel to substantially comply with the state's open government laws.

Capital Region residents don't need the nearly 50 pages of examples from NYPIRG's report to appreciate the findings. They have ample arguments right here for greater openness and accountability, from the questionable relationship between developer Bruce Tanski in Halfmoon and that community's power brokers to the East Greenbush Town Board's secretive deliberations on a proposed casino.

State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli surely appreciate the need, too. The Joint Task Force on Public Integrity they formed in 2011 has prosecuted about 50 people in a range of public positions.

NYPIRG recommends:

Overhauling the state's ethics law for municipalities to include strong conflict of interest provisions and more training.

Applying the same reporting standards on lobbying in municipalities with fewer than 50,000 residents as required in larger ones.

Strengthening the open meetings law to improve public participation and confidence in local government decisions.

Using measures like videotaping, archiving and webcasting meetings to bring local government transparency into the 21st century.

As the state Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo set the agenda for the 2015 session, these are surely worthwhile improvements to consider. While lawmakers and the governor have the state's own ethical loopholes to close as well, that hardly disqualifies them from making sure that local governments get it right."

626|Russia says NATO responsible for Afghan security after mission ends|"MOSCOW, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Wednesday that NATO continues to bear responsibility for maintaining security in Afghanistan after it withdraws troops from the country.

""Obviously, the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) activities have failed to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan for the (past) 13 years,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

""Multi-dimensional security threats, including religious extremism, terrorism, and drug crimes, which the mission has fought since 2001, not only continue to exist, but have a tendency to increase,"" it added.

Moscow said NATO still bears a great share of responsibility for training Afghan police and soldiers and for maintaining security in Afghanistan.

Zamir Kabulov, Russian special presidential envoy to Afghanistan, told Xinhua that following the end of the ISAF mission, armed groups of extremists, including the Islamic State, could spill into Central Asian countries such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan in early 2015.H He said the timing for the ISAF withdrawal was ""extremely inconvenient"" and accused the Western coalition of having done nothing substantial to bolster Afghanistan's economy since 2001."
627|Cuban Authorities Detain Artist, Dissidents, Thwarting Performance|"Cuban artist Tania Bruguera had a plan to test just how tolerant Cuba had become of dissident voices.

She planned a performance at Havana's Revolution Square for Tuesday afternoon. She would provide a microphone and Cubans were encouraged to speak about their vision for the island.

NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro spoke to Bruguera on Monday and asked her why she was planning the performance.

""It's just to tell people in the street come and share with us your doubts, your happiness - whatever you think right now about what is happening in Cuba, and what is the idea of Cuba that you want?"" Bruguera said.

Bruguera's performance would be the first event to really challenge the Castro regime's tight control of political dissidence, since Cuba and the United States announced their intent to normalize diplomatic relations.

Before the performance, Cuba's arts council issued a statement saying that after long conversations with Bruguera, they had decided not to support a performance of Yo también exijo, or I also demand.

The council said the performance was ""unacceptable"" in such a symbolic space and especially because of the ""vast media coverage and the manipulation which the performance has received by counterrevolutionary media.""

Ultimately, authorities blocked the performance from ever happening. According to 14ymedio.com, a news site run Cuban dissidents, Bruguera was arrested on Tuesday.

The site spoke to Yoani Sánchez, one of the site's contributors and Cuba's best known dissident, who said her husband Reinaldo Escobar was released from jail on Tuesday and he saw Bruguera at the same facility wearing a ""gray prison uniform.""

Diario de Cuba, a news outlet run from Spain, spoke to Bruguera's family who said Cuban state security agents knocked on Bruguera's door for hours before arresting her.

The news site reports that the plaza where the performance was going to take place was surrounded by police. One painter, a photographer, a former political prisoner and two journalists with Diario de Cuba were arrested as they made their way to the performance.

Roberta Jacobson, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said on Twitter that freedom of expression remains at the core of U.S. policy toward Cuba.

""We support activists exercising those rights and condemn today's detentions,"" Jacobson said.

Jeff Rathke, a State Department spokesperson, said that the U.S. will ""press the Cuban government to uphold its international obligations and to respect the rights of Cubans to peacefully assemble and express their ideas and opinions...""

The New York Times editorial board, which has for months called for an end to the U.S. embargo on Cuba, lamented Tuesday's events.

It wrote:



""By stifling critical voices, the Cuban government is showing its unwillingness to tolerate basic freedoms most citizens in the hemisphere enjoy. This move, unfortunately, will amplify the criticisms of those who opposed Mr. Obama's historic shift on Cuba policy. ""Heavy-handed tactics by the Castro government will give them ammunition next year, when Republicans will control both chambers of Congress, to stymie the Obama administration's steps to ease the embargo through executive authority and dim the prospects of legislative change to pare back the web of sanctions Washington imposes on Cuba. That result would be a shame and, in the long run, self-defeating for Havana.""

628|Using patient’s own tissues for breast reconstruction yields better results|"London : For women who have undergone mastectomy, breast reconstruction using the patient’s own tissues – rather than implants – provides higher level of satisfaction, research has found, reports IANS.

A mastectomy is surgery to remove a breast or part of a breast done primarily to prevent or treat breast cancer. “Autologous breast reconstruction (with the patient’s own tissues) leads to more satisfaction than does implant breast reconstruction, notwithstanding that women with an autologous breast reconstruction more often required a secondary correction,” said plastic surgeon Yassir Eltahir University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands.

Women have several options for breast reconstruction after mastectomy, in terms of the type of reconstruction and immediate versus delayed reconstruction.

The researchers used the recently developed “BREAST-Q” questionnaire to analyze patient satisfaction and quality of life after breast reconstruction.

The study included BREAST-Q surveys completed by 92 women who had breast reconstruction between 2006 and 2010. Forty-seven women underwent autologous reconstruction."

632|Who Was Kurmanjan Datka And What Does She Mean To The Kyrgyz People?|"When I found out several months ago about the upcoming release of ""Kurmanjan Datka, Queen Of The Mountains,"" it was an exciting thought for me. Like most who have traveled around Kyrgyzstan, I have seen statues to Kurmanjan Datka and streets named after her. But I only got pieces of her story here and there while I was wandering around the country, so I still wonder who exactly was Kurmanjan Datka and how significant is she to the Kyrgyz today?

Emily Canning's fine review of the movie includes a point I always felt keenly when she mentions a Kyrgyz girl who saw the film saying, ""Other people wouldn't understand, but I feel this movie in my heart.""

Indeed. How could I understand?

So I decided to contact someone who would understand and fortunately (very fortunately) for me I know Tynchtykbek Tchoroev (Chorotegin) who even among the Kyrgyz people is regarded as one of the leading sources of information about the nation and its history.

And because I've known him for so long I'm going to call him ""Tynch"" throughout this article. After all of these years Tchoroev just doesn't sound right to me. He's Tynch.

Tynch told me there were a few other female datkas (""datka"" in Kyrgyz; ""dadhoh"" in Persian, means ""righteous ruler"") in the first half of the 19th century, but none who compared to Kurmanjan (1811–1907), the daughter of Mamatbay from the Kyrgyz tribe of Mungush, because only Kurmanjan's authority as a powerful local ruler in the Alai Mountains and surrounding areas was recognized by three nations -- Kokand, Bukhara, and Russia.

She was given in marriage to a man she did not want and she fled back to her family. Such a thing is not heard of even today in the arranged marriages of people in the sedentary parts of Central Asia and in the 19th century it represented a major violation of patriarchal tradition, Tynch explains.

Kurmanjan's decision to marry a man she loved was also not the custom, though in her case the affection was reciprocated by Alymbek Datka (1799-1862), the son of Asan-biy from the tribe of Bargy, a part of the Kyrgyz tribe of Adygene, whom she married in 1832.

Tynch says Kurmanjan's stubbornness and insistence on marrying for love is ""the main message of the life of Kurmanjan, a hero of freedom for the Kyrgyz women.""

Alymbek was a capable nobleman who supported the unity of the Kyrgyz people and independence of the Kokand Khanate from tsarist Russia. Alymbek Datka was the governor of the Andijon Province in the Kokand Khanate and the ""atalyk"" (regent) of the 12-year-old Shah Murad, the khan of Kokand (in 1862, just before his own assassination).

After her powerful husband's assassination, Kurmanjan became datka, a transfer of power approved not only by the Kokand khan, who ruled lands that included Osh and Kurmanjan's homeland in the Alai Mountains, but also by Muzaffar, the emir of Bukhara, who temporarily ruled most of the Kokand Khanate during his invasion of this eastern Central Asian state.

Muzaffar officially met with Kurmanjan Datka in the city of Osh, not in the Alai Mountains, as depicted in the film.

Kurmanjan became, as Tynch says, ""a kind of general on one hand, and on the other hand a governor."" And it was a bad time to be either, for the Kokand Khanate was in decline and the Russian Army was making its way further into Central Asia.

Kurmanjan's husband had fought against the tsar's advancing army and some of her children did also. For instance, Abdylda-Bek, the older son of Alymbek Datka and Kurmanjan Datka, was a leading commander of the army of ""Pulat Khan"" during the huge people's uprising against the advancing Russian regime. Pulat Khan was a Ferghana Kyrgyz mullah named Iskhak Asan-uulu, who led the last powerful uprising against both pro-Russian Khudayar Khan and the Russian colonial administration.

Pulat Khan was executed by the Russians and Abdylda-Bek fled to Afghanistan via Pamir. He died in Afghanistan in 1877.

But vastly outmatched, ""Kurmanjan was wise enough to persuade the other Kyrgyz people not to fight against the very powerful Russian Army,"" Tynch notes.

Kyrgyzstan is the only Central Asian country that has had a woman president, Roza Otunbaeva.

As mentioned in Canning's film review, Kurmanjan did not fight to save her son from being executed by the Russians, according to some versions of Kurmanjan's story, she even attended the execution. She would not sacrifice the future of her people to save one of her offspring.

That is another message from Kurmanjan Datka's life, Tynch says, that ""her greatness was seen in the work for the interests of her people."" As he says, ""in the case of Kurmanjan, it's a reminder that a wife, a woman, could lead her nation.""

With all due respect to contemporary women in Asian politics such as Indira Ghandi, Benazir Bhutto, and Aung San Suu Kyi, Tynch adds that ""Kurmanjan Datka was such a woman at the end of the 19th century.""

Tynch notes that while the Russians treated Kurmanjan with respect and even bestowed the title ""tsaritsa Alaia"" (queen of the Alai) on her, she was still ""one of the tools to persuade the other Kyrgyz people in that region to live in peace within the framework of colonial Russia.""

But Kurmanjan was tolerant of different cultures, he adds, an important aspect since the area she lived in was and still is inhabited by scores of different peoples.

The people of her day seemed to respect Kurmanjan Datka for this tolerance and her ability to govern, because records of her can be found ""preserved in many manuscripts in Chagatai Turkic, Farsi (Persian), Kyrgyz, and other languages in Arabic script.""

One of the new legends about Kurmanjan Datka is the myth that she was writing poems in Persian and signing them with the name of Zinat. But Kyrgyz historians reject this, saying that Zinat was a male poet's pseudonym during the reign of Omar Khan in Kokand.

In the film, Kurmanjan is shown writing in Orkhon-Yenissei runic-like script. Tynch points out that even though the Kyrgyz could write in the runic-like script in the seventh-12th centuries, that script was first deciphered by the Danish scholar Vilhelm Thomsen (1842-1927) in 1893. Kurmanjan Datka would not have been aware of the early medieval alphabet script of her ancestors.

In 1906, Kurmanjan Datka was visited by Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, who was travelling as an ethnographer with the mission of a Russian secret intelligence officer from Russia to China via the Alai Mountains.

Mannerheim, who eventually became the president of Finland (1944-46), took a unique photo of Kurmanjan Datka. Mannerheim's photo was used when a Kyrgyz banknote was designed with Kurmanjan Datka's portrait.

The legacy of Kurmanjan Datka for the Kyrgyz people cannot be summed up in a few words or even many sentences, but if I could slip in my own comment I would point out that Kyrgyzstan is the only Central Asian country that has had a woman president, Roza Otunbaeva.

And Otunbaeva set a precedent in Central Asia -- that hopefully will be followed in the future -- by leaving office when her term expired without even attempting to groom a successor or keep a role in politics.

It is interesting to mention that in accordance with the decree signed by Otunbaeva on December 28, 2010, 2011 was declared the Year of Kurmanjan Datka in Kyrgyzstan in honor of the 200th anniversary of her birth.

633|Obama Won't Renominate Michael Boggs|"ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON -- It's over for Michael Boggs. Like, really over.

Georgia Sens. Johnny Isakson (R) and Saxby Chambliss (R) said late Tuesday night that President Barack Obama won't renominate Boggs next year for a lifetime post on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The news is a major victory for progressives who have fought Boggs' nomination all year.

""It is with regret that we announce that the President will not re-nominate Judge Michael Boggs to the United States District Court for a third time. We were informed of the President's decision by Denis McDonough, the President's chief of staff, prior to Thanksgiving. We regret the President's decision, as we have supported Judge Boggs throughout this process and remain steadfast in our support,"" the senators said in a statement.

They continued, ""Throughout the process, Judge Boggs has exhibited enormous restraint and the temperament expected of a jurist. These traits will serve him well for the opportunities we are confident the future holds for Judge Boggs. We wish him the best and thank him for his service to the people of Georgia.""

A White House spokesman confirmed that Obama won't renominate Boggs, but offered no additional comment.

Progressive groups and Senate Democrats threw everything they had at Boggs this year, determined to sink his nomination over his socially conservative track record. Abortion rights groups objected to votes he took as a Georgia state legislator to create ""Choose Life"" license plates and to post online the names of abortion providers at a time of high clinic violence. Civil rights leaders opposed him because of his vote to keep the Confederate insignia on the Georgia state flag. Gay rights groups opposed him for sponsoring a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.

It became clear earlier this fall that Boggs wasn't going anywhere this year, when Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) announced the Democratic votes weren't there to confirm him, and suggested that Obama withdraw the nomination. The lingering question has been whether the president would renominate Boggs in the new year, when Republicans control the Senate and would likely back him.

The White House calculation appears to be that it's not worth picking another fight with Democrats over the nomination.

Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.), one of Boggs' loudest critics, was thrilled with the news.

""I'm glad that the president has closed the door on this nomination so we can start the new year looking ahead, not back,"" Scott told HuffPost. ""There are hundreds of qualified attorneys in Georgia who could serve as a federal judge and I ask that an open and fair process be used to select the next nominees.""

NARAL Pro-Choice America, one of the groups that led the charge against Boggs, also celebrated the news.

""We're pleased that the deep concerns of tens of thousands of people and over 40 organizations were heard and that there will be one less federal judge who puts his personal ideology ahead of the constitutional rights of all Americans,"" said NARAL President Ilyse Hogue. ""2015 will be a better year because Michael Boggs will not hold the fate of millions of Americans in his hands.""

Obama had initially nominated Boggs as part of an all-or-nothing package of seven Georgia judicial nominees agreed upon by the president, Chambliss and Isakson. Some, like Boggs, were GOP picks and others were Democratic picks. The other six in the package were confirmed this year, but Boggs was held back.

Boggs' attorney Douglas Chalmers declined comment.

This post has been updated with comments from Scott and Hogue."
634|Indigenes express concern over choice of candidates|"By CHINELO OBOGO

Indigenes of Borno State resident in the South West region of Nigeria, known as the Yerwa-Oodua So­cio Economic Society, have expressed concern over the choice of gov­ernorship candidates representing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bor­no State.

In a press statement signed by the chairman of the association, Kachalla Bulama, he said Borno in­digenes were worried about the development in the state and demanded that only credible people with integ­rity be voted for.

He said the association did not have any political af­filiations and was not both­ered whether the PDP and the APC won the governor­ship but the interest of the in­digenes was on the credibil­ity of the person who would emerge governor.

According to him: “We are not card carrying mem­bers of any party, but we want the best candidates to represent the two main par­ties in the state, that is the APC and the PDP. The rea­son is so that if any of them wins, Borno State will have a good future.

“However, we are con­cerned about the candidate of the PDP, Mohammed Imam, who was allegedly imposed on the party by the former governor, Ali Modu Sheriff. We are aware that in the past, both men were not in good terms because of Imam’s attitude and we per­ceive that his candidature may be a problem for Borno if he is elected.”"

636|Losing Head and Heart|"Tragedies like the one in Peshawar are litmus tests for any nation- either bringing out the best, or exposing the bare bones. Pakistan’s response is curiously similar to the U.S response to 9/11. The fact that the U.S.’s counter-terror strategy accounts for the genesis of a much more brutal TTP and ISIS is lost to us. In the same manner as the US filled up prisons contravening law and depriving suspects and inmates of fair judicial process in its paranoia after 9/11, Pakistan is all set to establish special military courts in contravention of constitutional procedure, for swift conviction of ‘terrorists.’ The horrors that were unleashed in Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib and elsewhere in the name of national security are a forgotten narrative in the new Pakistan post 16/12.

Our collective response to the tragedy shows a febrile national demand for vengeance. Ironically, we are baying for the enemy’s blood just like the enemy is baying for ours- in the process, we lose the moral high ground we think we possess. In the process, ‘the faces change from pig to man and man to pig, and pig to man again- and already it is becoming impossible to say which was which.’

At present there are two extremist discourses in the country: the first, of course, is personified by the likes of the clerics at Lal Masjid and other fanatical groups, invoking religion to justify fanatical militancy. This religious extremism has come handy for movements like the Taliban who hide behind it for moral cover of their actions. There is, however, another extremist discourse: it comes from the liberals who have joined the chorus for an unrelenting militarist approach in response to the Peshawar attack. This high-pitched chorus decries any counter narrative or stirring of dissent. In the new Pakistan post 16/12, no one can take a different approach to dealing with the problem of terrorism in Pakistan, and have their opinion respected.

Anyone who does not take sides in these extremist discourses and believes in giving a chance to stable peace through justice and effective long-term peace-building is termed unpatriotic at best, and a terrorist-sympathizer, even supporter more commonly. There is no room for dissent. In this extremist furore, all hardline stances seem to have suddenly been vindicated. The iron-fisted policies of Musharraf that helped create the TTP are now being interpreted as farsighted wisdom. Frenzied calls for razing madrassahs to the ground or burning down mosques no longer sound outrageous in the spirit of febrile jingoism.

The strongly militarist strategy gives overweening powers to the army to deal with an issue that requires a more variegated long-term approach. It is likely to turn the country into a military state. The policy is uninsightful as it aims to do more of the same that created this monster, in order to eliminate it. The TTP emerged as a much more brutal and militant force than the original Taliban movement as a result of Pakistan’s disastrous decision to support the US in Afghanistan and sending its forces in the tribal areas to stop support for the anti-US Afghan resistance. This made the fiercely independent Pashtun tribes turn their guns against the Pakistan army and state. A renunciation of this ill-advised national policy is necessary as a first step to heal and rebuild, even as we take necessary firm action against the unrelenting perpetrators. Besides, the clandestine channels of support and funding to these militant groups must be traced and exposed before the nation. The enemy is not just the gun-toting Taliban militant, but his trainer, financier and facilitator. These vital connections have always been the state’s well-kept secret. And now, questions cannot be asked as we give a free rein to the military to ‘exterminate all brutes.’

In the tide of this nationalistic fervour to exterminate the brutes, drone operations in Pakistan suddenly and silently receive endorsement by national consensus. Questions are no longer welcome about civilian casualties or other fallout of the operation in the tribal areas. Answers are no longer deserved by the nation. The supreme ultimate goal is invincible national security, and ‘to this end, all means must give way.’ While the need for security is vital and understandable, bypassing all that is legal and rational and moral ought to be taken with a pinch of salt.

The deeper problems have to be dealt with through a wider, more insightful non-military approach: combating extremist discourse that misuses religion to justify terrorism and creating an effective counter discourse; listening and understanding, dialogue, mutual compromise and reconciliation; rehabilitation and peace-building. There are numerous examples in the past — even the recent past — of how war-ravaged communities drenched in the memory of oppression and pain, seething with unrelenting hate, have undertaken peace-building with some success. Possibilities to create the conditions that had led to ceasefires that brought temporary respite to the nation during this war, should have been explored with sincerity.

The series of executions after the Peshawar tragedy is also regrettable on many counts. Many of these convicts were juveniles when they committed the crime, brainwashed and swayed by passions. Many had confessions extracted through torture. These were the small fry, while the big fish have escaped the noose. So many high profile murderers and criminals go scot free, whereas these brainwashed juvenile offenders from an ethnic minority, a disadvantaged background are picked out selectively for blind ‘justice.’ Selective justice is injustice. Two such cases which have been highlighted by human rights groups are that of Shafqat Hussain convicted at the age of 14, and Mushtaq Ahmed who was tortured into a confession without being given access to a fair trial.

Our uninsightful reactionary policies reflect a loss of head and heart in the wake of the Peshawar tragedy. In this feverish frenzy of extremisms baying for each others blood, voices of moderation , justice and peace are dying out. And the rest is Silence.

638|Was the war in Afghanistan worth it?|"Today the coalition military operation in Afghanistan begins a new-phase. Afghan security forces are now in charge of providing stability across Afghanistan, supported by 13,500 foreign troops still arrayed throughout the country. Under the new NATO moniker ""Operation Resolute Support"", US, Australian, and other allied militaries will train, advise, and assist local forces. Though some US-led counter-terrorism efforts will persist, Pentagon leaders declared last Sunday that these will not be combat operations. By a pen stroke, on a press release rather than a peace agreement, this war is over.



The pressing question is what does this mean for Australians? And the answer I immediately reach for is this: precious little. Australians have been checked out of the war in Afghanistan since December 16, 2013 - the day our last troops left Uruzgan province and our base at Tarin Kowt was dismantled. That day Prime Minister Tony Abbott concluded that our troops departed ""not with victory, not with defeat, but with the hope that Afghanistan is a better place"". When asked what the military campaign had achieved the Prime Minister rightly pointed to the replacement of the Taliban, the disestablishment of Al Qaeda's operational sanctuary in Afghanistan, and the relative stability of modern Afghanistan. Pressed on whether the 13 year morass of money, machines, and mangled men and women had been worthwhile for Australians the Prime Minister concluded that it had, but presented his conclusion with little amplifying evidence or justification.



Speaking at this week's transition ceremony in Kabul, NATO's Afghanistan commander General John Campbell concluded ""we have lifted the Afghan people out of the darkness of despair and given them hope"". That little four letter word again, hope. When I was in the military, and in Afghanistan, my colleagues and I would joke that ""hope"" could never be a mission task verb. That is, we could not order our subordinates to hope for the right mission outcome. Ironically hope has become the outcome of a lengthy war in which billions have been spent and thousands of lives have been lost. The reality is that no one can truly say if the war in Afghanistan was worth it because no one yet knows how the fledgling experiment of newly democratic Afghanistan will turn out. Hope has been created. How effective it will be remains to be seen.



In Australia's case $9.3 billion has been spent on the campaign in Afghanistan along with 41 lives lost and more than 260 personnel wounded. More than 30 000 members of the Australian Defence Force cycled through the Afghanistan area of operations - all of whom have been changed in one way or another as the result of their experiences there. The cost to the Afghans has been far greater with thousands killed and maimed. Of course, death and destruction is common in war and doesn't necessarily indicate the futility of a military campaign. In an alternate reality, in which NATO forces never entered Afghanistan, the horror might have been much worse. But the question of whether this military campaign was worth it for Australia must certainly be answered - if only to help shape the military decisions facing us now, and that will certainly face us again in the future.



Yet to my knowledge, no comprehensive strategic review by the government is underway to ascertain how effective our campaign in Afghanistan has been. In more than a decade, parliament has conducted just one inquiry into the relatively narrow topic of the effectiveness of Australia's development assistance in Afghanistan. The Australian Army is examining lessons from Afghanistan pertinent to its institutional experience fighting there. But of the english speaking nations fighting in Afghanistan, Australia stands alone as the only one who has not yet publicly reviewed its performance there - or even its reasons for being part of the NATO military campaign.



Indeed, in the very year in which millions will be spent on military history, government has not even begun the process of writing the official history of the Australian Defence Force's involvement in the Afghanistan war. A study into the feasibility of an official Afghanistan War History was completed by the Australian War Memorial nearly three years ago. A proposal for the conduct of the Afghanistan official history was submitted to the federal cabinet almost 12 months ago. Yet in all its deliberations on national security matters in the past year the government has not yet, to the public's knowledge, found the time to commission an official historian for Afghanistan and begin the long process of formally detailing Australia's contribution to that war. The costs for the official Afghanistan history might run to $10 million, a puny investment given the ADF is spending as much for every week of current military operations in Iraq. And $10 million is a tiny downpayment to learn lessons from war that might save Australian lives in future military campaigns.



The Prime Minister to his credit has announced that Australians will formally mark the end of the Afghanistan war with a national series of homecoming parades on March 21 this year - a way of showing gratitude for the price paid on our behalf by veterans and their families. This is a noble sentiment and a welcome gesture. But absent of a dedicated effort to answer the big questions left about our involvement in Afghanistan, these parades will seem hollow. Australia's diplomats, aid workers, and soldiers had the courage to carry more than a decade of combat operations in Afghanistan. Now, we need the courage to confront the question of whether it was worth it.

639|Guinea Pig Barber Chews Hair|"

© Gina Cioli/I-5 Studio

Providing fun, safe toys is one way to prevent boredom in guinea pigs.

Q: I have two guinea pigs and just noticed that one is eating the other’s hair! Should I be concerned? Why is he doing this? Lux seems to be the only one of the two doing it.

A: This behavior is called ""barbering.” Guinea pigs do it to each other, and I have even had clients fall asleep with a guinea pig in their arms and wake up with an unwanted haircut. Barbering can be a sign of several things but the bottom line is that unless it is an isolated incident, the guinea pig will continue doing the behavior.

I have heard of a couple of possible reasons for guinea pig barbering. One is that it is a sign of affection in one guinea pig for another. A second is that it can be a result of boredom.

Providing an alternative like toys may remedy the situation if the cause is boredom. Try offering guinea pig toys or toys for large bird. Avoid toys that are made of latex, string or hide; closely inspect all toys to be sure none of these items are present on the toy.

In my experience, toys with bells are a great place to start with a guinea pig, preferably one that is on a chain so that it can be hung up. Hang it at about eye level so the guinea pig can manipulate the bell with his head or tongue. I have witnessed this a number of times as they will find the clapper with their tongue and then toss the ball with their head and then respond to the whole thing by popcorning wildly around the cage. They do this again and again with great glee.

Hard plastic cat balls are another treasured toy, as well as bird mirrors on a chain, cardboard toilet paper tubes stuffed with hay or hanging ""kabobs” that you can stuff with fruits and veggies. These ""kabobs” have a skewer secured with a bell at the bottom; guinea pigs will pick at it all day and be rewarded with the ringing of the bell while they are doing it.

Just like any creature who is confined, guinea pigs need an outlet for their energy and a distraction while in a cage. Providing these may change everything for the guinea pigs — and then it may not. I think some guinea pigs barber because they were formerly hairdressers who came back as guinea pigs (just kidding).

If you do not feel it is a matter of boredom, then a gentle application of lemon juice or bitter apple on the balding companion may discourage this behavior if it is becoming a matter of needing a shirt to cover the bald spots.

Another possibility is the guinea pig is pulling out his own fur. If you can confirm this by witnessing it, know that you might be dealing with a skin irritation, or an infestation. A visit to the veterinarian would be necessary to find out what is creating this condition. It has also been suggested that this can be a possible indication of something much deeper, such as a tumor, as these have been found on rare occasion located below the skin surface in the area of the chewing.

640|New Year stampede kills 36 in China's financial capital|"Shanghai (AFP) - A New Year's stampede on Shanghai's historic waterfront killed at least 36 revellers and injured dozens more, mostly women, as one police officer said fewer personnel than at previous events were securing the area.

While some witnesses said partygoers had scrambled for fake money thrown from a building, others said this was unlikely to have been the main cause and huge crowds were to blame.

Chinese President Xi Jinping demanded an immediate investigation.

The disaster, centred on a wide stairway leading up to a riverfront promenade, happened shortly before midnight on Wednesday as people packed the Bund area to usher in 2015.

The tragedy was a ""wake-up call that the world's second-largest economy is still a developing country which has fragile social management"", the official news agency Xinhua said in an unusually critical commentary.

""People were screaming, women were screaming and people started jumping off the staircase to get clear,"" said a Shanghai resident who gave her name as Sarah.

""There was quiet, and then people on the stairs fell in a wave and people started to get trampled,"" Sarah, a Singaporean national, told AFP.

People carried the dead and injured through a gap in the crowd as flashes from emergency vehicles and revellers' light sticks lit up the night, mobile phone video footage viewed by AFP showed.

American Andrew Shainker, an English teacher, posted on Chinese messaging network WeChat: ""I witnessed lifeless bodies being carried out of a crowd one by one and dumped on the street.

""You could hear screams of panic. What I thought was the best view on the Bund ended up being a front row seat to an international tragedy.""

View gallery Photo taken before midnight on December 31, 2014 shows revellers trapped on a stairway in a stampede …

""I felt I was suffocating,"" wrote one person posting on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. ""Some people with us will not come back.""

- Fewer police present -

City officials said 36 people were confirmed killed and 47 injured, 13 of them seriously. A Xinhua report late Thursday said seven of the injured had checked out of hospital.

Earlier, Xinhua said that among the dead was a Taiwanese, and that 25 of those killed were women. It added that the first 10 identified fatalities ranged in age from 16 to 36.

A Malaysian student at a Chinese university was among the dead, Malaysia's foreign ministry said.

Another Malaysian and two Taiwanese were among the injured, the Shanghai government reported.

The Bund, renowned for its colonial architecture, is the former financial district of China's commercial hub and now a popular tourist destination, packed with high-end restaurants and expensive boutiques.

Shanghai residents have traditionally flocked there to celebrate New Year, and more recently the district government has staged official celebrations.

This year's ""countdown"" included a light show, performances and fireworks.

View gallery Emergency vehicles move amongst the crowd after a New Year stampede at Shanghai's historic water …

It was scaled down and moved to a new location specifically due to concerns about overcrowding after nearly 300,000 people turned out to see the spectacle last New Year's Eve, the Shanghai Daily said.

Senior officer Cai Lixin acknowledged there were fewer police than for some previous events.

""Yesterday, there wasn't an event, therefore we didn't arrange for as many officers compared to something like last year's National Day celebration,"" he was quoted as saying by the government-linked Shanghai news portal Eastday.com, in a comment later apparently deleted from the website.

Shanghai television quoted authorities as saying a ""more than normal"" 700 police officers were present but more revellers than expected had shown up.

In its report late Thursday, Xinhua quoted Cai as saying some 500 police were mobilised after a surveillance camera showed a passageway near Chen Yi Square was congested after 11.30 pm.

Police forced their way into the heart of the crowd and found some people had ""physical discomfort"", he was quoted as saying.

Xinhua also stated that police ""expressed regret over their failure to effectively intervene"" when the flow of people ""increased irregularly"" at 11.30 pm.

- 'My wife is dead' -

Both Sarah and Shainker were in Bund 18, a shopping and entertainment complex where witnesses said dollar-like notes had been thrown from a window, prompting a scramble to retrieve them.

But others pointed out that a wide street separates the building from the staircase where the main crush occurred.

Pictures posted online showed the slips of paper were a similar size, shape and colour as US currency, but emblazoned with the logo of M18, a nightclub, and stamped ""New Year 2015"".

Xinhua said Thursday that surveillance footage showed the notes had been thrown after the stampede, at 11.47 pm, citing the Shanghai police official microblog.

Shanghai television said authorities were investigating the money-throwing incident, but attributed the cause of the accident to people slipping and falling in the crowded conditions.

The plaza where the accident took place is named for Shanghai's first Communist mayor Chen Yi, and mourners laid flowers at his statue Thursday.

Large numbers of police were stationed in the area Thursday and a nearby subway station was closed for safety reasons, Xinhua said.

One young man emerged from the Shanghai Number One People's Hospital, where most of the injured were taken, telling AFP: ""My wife is dead.""

Most large gatherings in China are carefully controlled but there have been other incidents in which overcrowding has caused deaths."

643|Tibet's economy registers twelve percent GDP growth this year|"The economy of Tibet Autonomous Region, in southwest China, grew by 12 percent in 2014, a local news agency reported on Wednesday.



Tibet's GDP is expected to hit 92.5 billion yuan (USD 15.11 billion) this year, maintaining its double-digit growth since 1994 even though China's overall GDP declined to about 7.8 percent last year.



China for the first time in recent years was expected to miss the official target growth of 7.5 percent.



""Tibet's sustained, rapid and sound development continued in 2014,"" Communist Party of China's Tibet Autonomous Region secretary, Chen Quanguo said.



The per capita net income of farmers and herdsmen in the region hit 7,471 yuan (USD 1245) this year, up by 14 percent year on year.



The per capita disposable income of urban residents also increased by 8 percent year on year to reach 22,026 yuan (USD 3670).



Tibet's economic growth was boosted by massive investments in infrastructure projects as China has been pouring billions of dollars to develop the region.



The remote Himalayan region boasts of five airports, railway and road networks connecting Chinese mainland besides wide network of dams on the rivers.Tibet's trade is also boosted by enhanced trade relations with bordering Nepal.

644|Tight supplies drive CME live cattle to 6th straight yearly gain|"CHICAGO Dec 31 Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures posted their sixth consecutive yearly gain, closing out 2014 up 23.2 percent bolstered by the smallest herd in 63 years after several years of drought damaged corps.

Of the 19 commodities listed by the ThomsonReuters- Jefferies CRB index, CME live cattle was the second strongest performer for 2014 behind coffee, which was up 50.5 percent.

Several factors are driving cattle including severe drought conditions that pushed feed costs to record highs, especially in 2012, said John Ginzel, an analyst with Chicago-based brokerage firm Linn Group.

Expensive corn prompted aggressive herd liquidation, which resulted in record-high beef and cattle prices, he said.

In November, slaughter-ready cattle reached an all-time high of $174 per hundredweight (cwt).

November retail beef hit a record $6.30 per lb, up 6 cents from the month before and 89 cents higher than a year ago, based on U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

In December, Chicago Board of Trade corn was at $3.88 1/8 per bushel, down sharply from its $8.07 3/8 record high in August 2012.

This year's bumper harvest brought down corn prices, but rebuilding the herd is a long process because it takes at least 2 years to raise a calf to maturity before they are accepted by meat packers such as Tyson Foods and Cargill Inc..

Furthermore, replenishing cattle lost to years of drought requires ranchers to hold back heifers and cows for breeding, rather than sending them to packing plants, thereby prolonging the rebuilding effort, said Ginzel.

Until then, the consequences of high beef and cattle prices will linger throughout the upcoming year, with some of that reduced production being mitigated by heavier cattle weights, he said.

On Wednesday, CME cattle closed the day lower on year-end profit taking. (Editing by David Gregorio)"

647|Another EUR 9mn to repair flood-damaged homes|"Politics Another EUR 9mn to repair flood-damaged homes Marko Blagojevic says the government has so far allocated RSD 4.2 billion for the reconstruction of houses damaged in the May floods. Source: Tanjug Wednesday, December 31, 2014 | 16:54 Tweet (Beta, file)

It also ""secured another EUR 9 million for the coming year,"" explained the director of the Serbian Government Office for Reconstruction and Flood Relief.

The funds to repair damaged homes in 2015 are secured through the European Union programs for the reconstruction of housing objects severely damaged in the floods, Blagojevic told the New Year's edition of Belgrade daily Informer.



Financial aid will be available in late January and early February, and it will also be transferred to the areas hit by September floods, such as the eastern Serbian municipality of Kladovo, on the banks of the Danube, he said.



Blagojevic specified that 17,700 families received funds totaling RSD 4.22 billion for the reconstruction of damaged homes, and accommodation has been provided for 292 out of the 337 families whose homes were completely destroyed by the floods.



""This means that they either received money to buy a new house or a new house was built for them,” he explained, adding that the remaining 45 houses under construction are to be completed in January. Most of the new homes are equipped with furniture and home appliances, he added.



The majority of damaged roads have been reopened for traffic, but much is yet to be done to remedy the landslides and repair the damaged banks and infrastructure, said Blagojevic.



As far as the energy sector is concerned, the work is going well and we expect the coal production in Kolubara to be fully restored in the spring, said the director of the Office for Reconstruction and Flood Relief."

653|Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth,... -- NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --|"NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Passive optical LAN (POL) is a Layer-2 transport medium, built with passive optical network (PON) technology, which provides converged data, video, and voice services at gigabit speeds over a single strand of fiber to the user's location. These solutions make use of a number of passive optical components. Majority of these components including optical cables, optical couplers, optical power splitters, optical encoders, patch cords and pigtails, optical connectors, optical amplifiers, optical transceivers, fixed and variable optical attenuators, optical circulators, wavelength division multiplexers/de-multiplexers, and optical filters can now be found in use in FTTH applications and current data networks. These components also find use in applications such as fiber in the loop (FITL), interoffice, loop feeder, hybrid fiber-coaxial cable (HFC), synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) systems and synchronous optical network (SONET).

Passive optical local area network (POL) solutions are more environment-friendly than the traditional copper-based Ethernet local area network. Instead of using workgroup switches, the POL solution uses optical splitters. By eliminating the workgroup switches, it adheres to HVAC standards, thereby eradicating the usage of thousands of KW energy and acting as a more cost-effective option. Furthermore, since there is no need for rack-mounted switches, usage of non-renewable electrical equipment is minimized and power consumption reduced.

Passive optical LAN (POL) helps in saving the total cost of ownership (TCO) by a huge amount, as the cost of installation of the equipment is low. In addition, the highly-efficient equipment promises high return on investments. This low cost of ownership is achieved with POL using a highly-centralized distribution network, which is passive in nature. With the savings in both capital and operating expenditure, POL offers considerable saving in the total cost of ownership. In traditional networks, network upgradation and patches lead to a large amount of operational expenditure. However, in POL, network upgradation is much easier, as it uses the existing fiber optic cable and only the electronics are to be replaced, rather than replacing the whole infrastructure, which helps to save 75% of the expenditure.

This market research study analyzes the passive optical LAN market on a global level, and provides the estimates in terms of revenue (USD billion) from 2014 to 2020. It recognizes the drivers and restraints affecting the industry and analyzes their impact over the forecast period. Moreover, it identifies the significant opportunities for market growth in the coming years.

The report segments the market on the basis of geography into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific (APAC), and Rest of the World (RoW), estimated in terms of revenue (USD billion). The report also segments the market based on components into optical cables, optical couplers, optical power splitters, optical encoders, patch cords and pigtails, optical connectors, optical amplifiers, optical transceivers, fixed and variable optical attenuators, optical circulators, wavelength division multiplexers/de-multiplexers, and optical filters. Based on applications, the passive optical LAN market is further segmented into fiber in the loop (FITL), interoffice, synchronous optical network (SONET), loop feeder, synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) systems and hybrid fiber-coaxial cable (HFC). All these segments have also been estimated in terms of revenue (USD billion) on the basis of geography.

For a better understanding of the passive optical LAN market, we have given a detailed analysis of the value chain. A detailed Porter's five forces analysis offers a better understanding of the intensity of competition in the market. Furthermore, the study also comprises a market attractiveness analysis, where the regions are benchmarked based on their market size, growth rate and general attractiveness.

The report provides company market share analysis of various industry participants. In addition, the key players in the passive optical LAN market have also been profiled. The company profiles highlight the company overview, financial overview, business strategies, SWOT analysis, and recent developments in the field of passive optical LAN. Some of the key market participants profiled in this report include TE Connectivity Ltd., 3M Company, Tellabs Inc., Zhone Technologies Inc., and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.

656|Chris Brown Cancels New Year's Eve Concert In Philippines|"Truth rating: 10

By Michael Lewittes

Chris Brown canceled his New Year’s Eve concert in the Philippines just hours before he was scheduled to perform because he reportedly lost his passport. Brown took to Twitter on Wednesday to announce that he was unable to make it to the Philippine Arena for the holiday show. “#TeamBreezyManila! Due to unfortunate circumstances I can’t bring in the new year with you,” he wrote. “Too bad since the Philippines Arena is one of the best arenas in the world! Stay tuned Team Breezy!!!!”

On Wednesday, Brown’s local representatives told the Maligaya Development Corp., the organizers of the event, that he was still in Los Angeles. The planners said in a statement, “According to them, Chris Brown lost his passport the day before the scheduled event. Hence despite having entered into a contract with us, Chris Brown would not be able to comply with his obligation to perform.” There’s no word yet whether Brown will make it up to the organizers.

Brown was slated to perform in the 55,000-seat arena along with other artists as a part of the New Year’s Eve concert, which also featured a fireworks show. What do you think of Brown being forced to cancel his performance?"

658|Somber New Year's as bad weather hampers AirAsia search|"Heavy rains and winds are impeding efforts to recover more bodies from the AirAsia Flight 8501 crash site in the Java Sea. VPC

Indonesian military personnel carry coffins of victims recovered from AirAsia Flight 8501 upon their arrival at the military air base in Surabaya. (Photo: Juni Kriswanto, AFP/Getty Images)

SURABAYA, Indonesia — As wind and rain hamper recovery operations of AirAsia Flight 8501, this city started a somber new year by canceling holiday celebrations as hundreds of people turned out for a candlelight vigil.

The search for 162 people who vanished Sunday aboard the Airbus A320 was severely limited Wednesday by heavy rain, wind and thick clouds over the Java Sea, forecast to last through Friday. Choppy conditions prevented divers from entering the water and helicopters were largely grounded.

Sonar images identified what appeared to be large parts of the plane, but strong currents were moving the debris.

""It seems all the wreckage found has drifted more than 50 kilometers (30 miles) from yesterday's location,"" said Vice Air Marshal Sunarbowo Sandi, search and rescue coordinator in Pangkalan Bun on Borneo island, the closest town to the targeted area. ""We are expecting those bodies will end up on beaches.""

The first two bodies of the seven already recovered arrived Wednesday at a military airstrip at Surabaya's airport. They were in simple wooden coffins — numbered 001 and 002 — with purple flowers on top. The two victims were a woman wearing blue jeans and a boy. The other five bodies — three male and two female — will remain on a warship until the weather clears.

Several churches around Surabaya held memorial services on New Year's Eve. One church — Manwar Sharon Church — lost 41 members in the crash.

On Wednesday, about 100 relatives gathered for a prayer service in a hall at the airport, where the Rev. Philip Mantofa urged the crowd to hold onto their faith despite their pain.

""Some things do not make sense to us, but God is bigger than all this,"" he said. ""Our God is not evil … help us God to move forward even though we are surrounded by darkness.""

Florida Rambu Bangi Roni was preparing for an evening service at Gereja Kristen Indonesia Ngagel church, a Presbyterian congregation of around 2,000. Three members of her church — two adults and their child — were on the flight. The pastor said the church was changing its planned New Year's Eve service into a memorial for the passengers.

""The tragedy of AirAsia is a reminder,"" she said. ""We don't know what time we will die. So we should care for others, make them happy. It's important.""

At a nearby evangelical megachurch, Andrew Rizal, a doctor, said he was thinking of the passengers and their families. ""It's really sad,"" Rizal said. ""There are so many families that can't have New Year with their loved ones tonight.""

For grieving relatives at the airport's crisis center, large flower wreaths were placed nearby as the wait continues for word about their loved ones and answers about what caused the crash.

William Kai — whose brother-in-law David Gunawan and his wife and two children, ages 7 and 10, were on the flight — said his family was leaning on each other and their faith in God for strength.

""We are devastated for sure,"" he said. ""We're humans. We're never ready for this kind of stuff. We just have to stay strong for each other.""

He said they were still holding on to a sliver of hope for survivors. ""Thinking logically, the chances are very, very low,"" he said. ""Right now, we live by faith, not by sight. We believe in God.""

Recovering bodies was expected to remain difficult for the near future. Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency predicted that the conditions would worsen, with more intense rains through Friday.

AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said Wednesday: ""The search-and-rescue operations were unfortunately hampered by bad weather today, but I am hopeful they will be able to resume the search tomorrow.""



Airport management company Angkasa Pura I officially handed over responsibility for the crisis center to AirAsia on Wednesday evening. The center will be relocated Thursday morning to Bhayangkara Hospital.

The Airbus A320, which took off from Surabaya for Singapore, lost contact with air traffic control Sunday morning. Pilots had asked permission to climb to avoid storm clouds, but six other aircraft were in the vicinity, so controllers denied the request. Minutes later, the jet vanished from radar screens without declaring an emergency.

660|Cheap Price Tag Is Just A Bait – MotoringCrunch|"The Chevrolet Colorado is definitely the highlight of this year as it came out to be one of the best pickup trucks in history. The Colorado exhibits great power while also being efficient. Some even say that the Colorado is also affordable but for us, it isn’t.

Apparently, the low base price of $20,995 for the entry level Chevrolet Colorado is nothing more than an illusion. To better understand the matter, consumers will have to refer to the Colorado vehicle generator found at Chevrolet’s website.

The online generator allows consumers to design the pickup truck with their needs in mind. The entry level fee of $20,995 only covers the 2-seater model with a small bed and all the basic appliances that runs on 2WD.

For certain, the basic model is not good enough for every consumer. For a decent rig, the Colorado will cost a whopping $38,915. This will add in 4-doors with an SLE Crew Long Box. Also, the decent Colorado is powered by a 3.6L V8 that has 305hp and 269ft-lbs of torque to spare.

The point here is that consumers need to fork out a minimum extra of ten grand if they wish for something decent and reliable. Considering the upgrades with that fee, the Colorado is without a doubt overpriced. For that same amount, there are many other great vehicles consumers can settle with.

Then again, none can question the love for the Chevrolet Colorado. Just by gazing at it, the pickup truck is by far the prettiest vehicle in its segment. Maybe, the above content can wake the masses from the Colorado hypnotism."

665|Three Children Have Died From Flu In Tennessee In December|"With the Sri Lankan navy arresting six more Indian fishermen for allegedly fishing in its waters, the fishermen's body on Thursday sought Central Government's intervention for a permanent solution to the long standing issue.



The fishermen were arrested yesterday for trespassing in the territorial waters of Sri Lanka and two of their trawlers were also seized by the Sri Lankan authorities.



The Sri Lankan navy confirmed the same in a brief press note published on its website.



The fishermen were arrested when they ""had been fishing 3.5 nautical miles and 5.2 nautical miles north-west of Kovilan Point.""



The Sri Lankan navy had earlier on Tuesday arrested 15 Indian fishermen and seized two boats.



Secretary of Fishermen Association, Kalaikudam Sagayam said that the fishermen were scared and asked the Centre to take strong steps to resolve the issue.







""A few days back Sri Lanka arrested 15 fishermen and seized our boats and now they have arrested six more fishermen. Despite our state government raising the issue with the federal government no action had been taken in this regard. If this goes on soon all our boats will be in the hands of the Sri Lankan navy,"" said Sagayam.







The arrested fishermen and the trawlers were taken to Kareinagar to be handed over to Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Jaffna) for further action. (ANI)"

667|"""You Must Never Give Up On Nigeria""; Muhammadu Buhari's New Year Message to Nigerian Youths"|"As we welcome the year 2015, I have shared a message to Nigerians in general, but I find it crucial to send another message directly to Nigeria’s youth, who are the major stakeholders of this enterprise.

The year 2014 was a challenging one for most citizens of our dear country.

We remember our compatriots who were brutishly killed or maimed by evil terrorists in 2014. I remember with a still broken heart that 219 of our children from Chibok are yet missing, let down by a country that should protect them. I remember that, even as I speak, some of our towns and villages are yet under the occupation of Boko Haram.

Yes, it is enough for you to despair. It is enough for you to wonder if your country cares about you and can protect you. But do not despair.

2015 has arrived at a time of great discomfort; but the beauty of the New Year is that we can look forward with renewed hope and the knowledge that things can and will change.

In Nigeria’s particular case, we can truly look forward to the change that the elections can, and will, bring. Our country will be secure again. Our country will prosper again.

I have faith that 2015 is the year we shall begin to write a new story – a story of our youth creating jobs and expanding the frontiers of innovation and creativity everywhere from Mavin Records to the

Co-Creation Hub; a story of genuine investment in our children and students be they in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka or in the Delta State University, Abraka; a country that finally makes a permanent

shift from our debilitating dependence on the free-falling price of crude oil.

I have unshakeable faith that 2015 will be the year of change.

Now some of you have asked me: what exactly does ‘change’ mean?

I have taken time to explain this at different opportunities, but on this special day, let me remind you in five short statements.

Change means:

1. A country that you can be proud of at anytime and anywhere: where corruption is punished, where your leaders are disciplined and lead with vision and clarity; where the stories that emerge to the world

from us are full of hope and progress.

A Nigeria in which neither yourselves, nor your parents, families or friends will have to fear for your safety, or for theirs. A Nigeria where citizens get the basics that any country should provide: infrastructure that works, healthcare that is affordable, even free; respect for the environment and sustainable development, education that is competitive and outcome-oriented in a

knowledge-economy. A country that provides jobs for its young people, reducing unemployment to the lowest of single digits and providing safety nets so that no one is left behind.

5. A Nigeria where entrepreneurship thrives, enterprise flourishes and the government gets out of your way so that you can create value, build the economy and aggressively expand wealth. Are these things truly possible? Of course. That is the essence and outcome of leadership, and that is what my party and I promise you as we get into 2015. My dear friends, this New Year, more than ever before, I am hopeful about Nigeria. Yes, you are disappointed and you are angry, as you are entitled to, but you must never give in to the temptation to feel so weighed down by those who have failed you that you lose your hope and your energy and your passion to see change. You must never give up on Nigeria. Together, we can build a nation that is secure, prosperous and gives everyone a fair chance. This is the promise that 2015 holds. That is the promise that change will bring. That is the promise that I bring to you. Once again, I wish everyone a happy and prosperous New Year. Thank you and God bless Nigeria.

Members of Pussy Riot are among eighteen protesters that have been detained in Moscow.

Pink News reports that Pussy Riot member Maria Alekhina said on Twitter that she and other protesters were detained by police early on Wednesday after congregating in Red Square.

According to the report, a few thousand people rallied outside Red Square on Tuesday in the boldest anti-government demonstration in years to protest against the court conviction of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and his brother. Navalny is a fierce critic of President Putin. He has called for LGBT pride events to be allowed in Moscow and has the support of Pussy Riot.

The U.S. State Department said the sentencing was “a disturbing development designed to punish and deter political activism.”"
670|Gun safety debate reignites after mother shot by two-year-old|"Veronica Rutledge with her son. (Facebook)

The accidental fatal shooting of a US woman by her own two-year-old son at a Walmart store has left her family devastated and again raised questions about gun safety in America.

Veronica Rutledge was out shopping with her son and three nieces on Tuesday in Hayden, Idaho when the child unzipped her handbag -- specially designed to carry a concealed weapon -- and the gun went off.

The 29-year-old nuclear research scientist, who held a concealed-carry permit, got the bag last week as a Christmas gift from her husband Colt Rutledge, with whom she shared a passion for guns.

""An inquisitive two-year-old boy reached into the purse, unzipped the compartment, found the gun and shot his mother in the head,"" her father-in-law Terry Rutledge told The Washington Post.

""It's a terrible, terrible incident.""

He added that his son, the victim's husband, now is grappling with how to break the news to the youngster, the couple's only child.

""He has a two-year-old boy right now who doesn't know where his mom is and he'll have to explain why his mom isn't coming home,"" Rutledge said.

""And then, later on (in) his life, as he questions it more, he'll again have to explain what happened, so we'll have to relive this several times over.""

Veronica Rutledge was a scientist at the Idaho National Laboratory, a federal nuclear research facility in the east of the state, and co-authored a number of published papers.

Staff at the laboratory are ""deeply saddened"" by her death, a spokeswoman told AFP.

Rutledge and her husband -- who married in 2009 -- shared a keen interest in guns, spending time at shooting ranges and going out hunting.

Rutledge illustrated her Facebook page with a smiling profile photo of herself and her little boy, alongside a panoramic photo of a rainbow.

Some 30,000 deaths a year in the United States involve firearms. The majority are suicides; many others are murders. But some involve children laying their hands on loaded weapons.

In 2011 alone, 140 children and teenagers died as a result of an unintentional shooting, more often than not inside a home, according to a study from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Several thousand more sustained non-fatal injuries.

Walmart closed its Hayden location -- normally open 24 hours a day -- after Tuesday's shooting, which occurred in the electronics department. It reopened Wednesday.

Coincidentally, the retail chain is the biggest gun retailer in the United States, which has seen an uptick in gun-buying in recent years among women looking for greater personal protection.

Fifteen percent of American women own a gun, according to a Gallup poll analysis.

There has been a corresponding boom in fashionable handbags specially designed to hold a concealed weapon, including one brand called Gun Tote'n Mamas.

Gun dealer Robin Ball, speaking to local TV station KREM, expressed surprise that a two-year-old would have the finger strength required to pull a trigger.

She speculated that the absence of an external safety mechanism -- common for many contemporary handguns -- might have been a factor.

""Murphy's law just came into play today in so many ways and there are irreversible consequences for that,"" Ball said.

Largely rural Idaho has one of the highest gun ownership rates in the United States, as well as a rate of violent crime below the national average.

And earlier this year, its state legislature passed a law intended to pre-empt the introduction of any new federal gun control laws.

""Accidents like this cause us all to pause and remember that firearm safety is one of those areas where we can never forget the awesome responsibility that comes with gun ownership and must always be aware and living the rules of firearm safety,"" said Carrie Lightfoot of The Well Armed Woman, a website for female gun owners.

Prospects for tougher gun control laws, however, remain thin.

In the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut school massacre in December 2012 in which 20 children died, President Barack Obama pushed for universal background checks for all gun-buyers.

But the proposal dramatically collapsed in the face of opposition in Congress, as did a bid to outlaw military-style assault rifles.

Meanwhile, over the years, a growing number of US states have adopted laws allowing their residents to obtain concealed carry permits.

In December 2011, the US Government Accountability Office estimated there were about eight million concealed handgun permits, but by June 2014, the number had grown to well over 11.1 million.

Florida has issued the most concealed carry permits -- 1.28 million. The state with the highest percentage of residents with such permits is South Dakota at 12 percent.

In August, a nine-year-old girl learning to fire an Uzi submachine gun accidentally killed her instructor at the Arizona Last Stop gun range in the southwestern state.

She was unable to control the weapon's recoil as she fired it, and an errant bullet struck her 39-year-old instructor in the head, killing him, a police report said.

671|Governor commutes last four death sentences|"Governor O'Malley today issued the following statement on the sentences of the four remaining inmates sentenced to death in Maryland:

“In a representative government, state executions make every citizen a party to a legalized killing as punishment.

“Two years ago, after much debate and consideration, the Maryland General Assembly abolished the death penalty in our State replacing the sentence with life without the possibility of parole.

“The General Assembly's abolition of the death penalty was not challenged in referendum.

“There are four inmates who currently sit on Maryland's death row.

“Recent appeals and the latest opinion on this matter by Maryland's Attorney General have called into question the legality of carrying out earlier death sentences -- sentences imposed prior to abolition. In fact, the Attorney General has opined that the carrying out of prior sentences is now illegal in the absence of an existing statute.

“I have now met or spoken with many of the survivors of the victims of these brutal murders.

“They are all good and decent people who have generously granted me the courtesy of discussing the cases of their individual family members. I am deeply grateful and appreciative of their willingness to speak with me.

“They have borne their grief bravely along with the additional torment of an un-ending legal process. If endless death penalty appeals were to continue, these family members would, no doubt, persevere through that process with continued courage and fortitude. Of this I have no doubt.

“The question at hand is whether any public good is served by allowing these essentially un-executable sentences to stand.

“In my judgment, leaving these death sentences in place does not serve the public good of the people of Maryland -- present or future.

“Gubernatorial inaction -- at this point in the legal process -- would, in my judgment, needlessly and callously subject survivors, and the people of Maryland, to the ordeal of an endless appeals process, with unpredictable twists and turns, and without any hope of finality or closure.

“In the final analysis, there is one truth that stands between and before all of us. That truth is this -- few of us would ever wish for our children or grandchildren to kill another human being or to take part in the killing of another human being. The legislature has expressed this truth by abolishing the death penalty in Maryland.

“For these reasons, I intend to commute Maryland's four remaining death sentences to life without the possibility of parole.

“It is my hope that these commutations might bring about a greater degree of closure for all of the survivors and their families.”"
672|UPDATE 1-TRLPC-EMEA lending of $1.2 trn highest since financial crisis|"* Loan volumes 25 pct up on 2013 total

* M&A financing doubles to $211.2 bln y-o-y

* Refinancing still dominates lending activity (Adds details)

By Alasdair Reilly and Claire Ruckin

LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Syndicated lending in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) reached $1.2 trillion in 2014, the highest annual total since 2007 and 25 percent up from $930 billion in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.

Lending activity was buoyed by the return of acquisition financing and record refinancing.

M&A loan volume of $211.2 billion was more than double the $100.2 billion raised in 2013, as confidence grew among borrowers to make debt financed acquisitions, while strong bond and equity markets gave lenders the comfort of quick repayments through the capital markets.

""The emergence of M&A was healthy and had been a long time coming. There was fresh blood brought to the market with new deals,"" a loan syndicate head said.

A 12.5 billion euro ($15.17 billion) loan backing German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen's acquisition of US rival TRW Automotive was the largest loan of the year. The underwritten financing closed oversubscribed in October, underlining the market appetite for drawn term debt.

In line with other large M&A transactions, the loan included a sizeable $9.3 billion-equivalent bridge loan.

German drugs and chemicals firms Merck KGaA and Bayer also tapped the market in 2014 for jumbo acquisition loans.

Merck backed its acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich in the US with an underwritten $15.6 billion financing that included an $11.6 billion bridge loan and closed in October.

Meanwhile, Bayer agreed a $14.2 billion loan in June, backing its acquisition of US-based Merck & Co's consumer care business. The financing comprised a $12.2 billion bridge loan and a $2 billion medium-term facility.

In September, British cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco closed $13.1 billion of loans for its acquisition of brands and assets from Reynolds American and for refinancing. The deal included a $4.1 billion bridge loan.

RECORD REFINANCING

The main driver of activity in 2014 remained refinancing, which made up 68 percent of total loan volume.

Refinancing reached $798.3 billion in 2014, the highest on record as many of Europe's largest borrowers returned to the market to refinance or amend and extend existing facilities. High levels of market liquidity and competition between banks saw many borrowers return early to refinance existing deals well ahead of their scheduled maturities on better terms.

With banks aggressively bidding to win mandates, loan pricing remained under pressure. Average margins for single-A rated companies fell to 20bp by the end of the year, while average triple-B margins remained at 50bp.

""The refinancings we've seen this year are all tightly priced, pure relationship plays with very high hit rates,"" a senior banker said.

Diversified natural resource company Glencore tapped the market in June for a $15.3 billion refinancing as it continued its trajectory away from a pure trade and commodity player, achieving cheaper pricing than on the $17.3 billion facility it arranged in 2013.

Nestle also returned to the market in 2014, closing an increased 6 billion euro refinancing of its one-year facility from 2013 and extending its 5 billion euro, five-year facility by another year.

Other sizeable refinancings were seen for Vitol, Shell , Volkswagen and GDF Suez.

With the main wave of refinancing over, banks will now be focussed on increased levels of M&A and other non-core market segments like trade finance and infrastructure financing.

Loan volume in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEEMEA) fell 23.5 percent to $145.5 billion in 2014 from $190.4 billion in 2013, driven by the collapse of the Russia loan market as a result of Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's role in Ukraine's crisis and plunging oil prices.

Lending to Russian borrowers -- traditionally the largest market in the CEEMEA loan market -- hit a ten-year low of $12.3 billion in 2014, 74 percent down from $47.2 billion raised in 2013.

LEVERAGED M&A PICKUP

M&A also fuelled an increase in activity in Europe's leveraged loan market, which rose 4.9 percent to $200.8 billion in 2014 year-on-year, the highest volume since the financial crisis.

Some $61 billion were acquisition-related, making up 30.3 percent of leveraged loan volume, up from 23 percent in 2013 and 17.9 percent in 2012, according to the data. Of all leveraged M&A volume, just under half (44.2 percent) was for corporate leveraged borrowers rather than sponsors, compared to 34.6 percent in 2013.

After ZF Friedrichshafen, the second largest European leveraged loan of 2014 was a 6.8 billion euro loan for DE Master Blenders, which refinanced debt and helped fund a merger of its coffee business with that of Mondelez into a combined company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The euro loan formed part of a wider 7.6 billion euro-equivalent financing.

A 2.85 billion euro loan, which included 1.9 billion euros of term loans, backing French telecoms operator Numericable's acquisition of rival firm SFR, was Europe's largest-ever covenant-lite leveraged loan. The loan formed part of a wider 4.7 billion euro-equivalent dual-denominated leveraged loan for the company, which in turn formed part of a wider $21.9 billion loan and bond financing.

""M&A has come back. 2015 will be another record year again as more M&A activity is expected next year,"" a lawyer said.

BNP Paribas once again topped the EMEA syndicated loan bookrunner league table, with a $55 billion share of the market from 249 deals. Deutsche Bank was a close second, with $54.6 billion and 151 deals, while Citigroup was third, with $40.2 billion and 113 deals.

673|Will Clinton run? She needs to decide in 2015|"WASHINGTON (AP) — A still undeclared candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton sits atop the prospective field of Democratic presidential candidates for 2016. But as Clinton has said before, if she runs again, she’ll work as hard as any underdog.

Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid stumbled, undermined by anti-war activists who opposed her vote to authorize the Iraq war, infighting among her staff and a large entourage that made it difficult for her to connect with voters on a one-on-one basis.

How she attempts to address those deficiencies — assuming she runs for president, as expected — will be a big part of Clinton’s efforts next year. Here’s a look at some things to watch from Clinton in 2015.

ANNOUNCEMENT: Speculation about the timing of Clinton’s announcement has been rampant. Some Democrats wanted her to make it official after the party’s dreadful midterm elections. Clinton has scheduled some paid speeches into March, raising the possibility that she will hold off until spring. Democratic insiders expect a different approach this time — recall her January 2007 video declaring, “I’m in to win” — that harnesses the grassroots activists sowed by outside super PACs and allows her to make a big splash in online fundraising. “All of these supporters are a ready-made asset, eager to help promote her message and to stand by her in what we can safely expect to be a relentless, even unprecedented, swamp of negativity from her opponents,” said Tracy Sefl, an adviser to Ready for Hillary.

RATIONALE: Clinton has said anyone who runs for president needs to have a specific agenda and have a reason to run. She offered hints at what her rationale might be during the fall campaign, advocating for middle-class economic prosperity, paid leave for working mothers and a hike in the minimum wage. The party’s liberal wing will look for signs that she might offer a brand of economic populism that has made them gravitate to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who says she’s not running in 2016.

OBAMA: Where Clinton embraces the president’s agenda, and where she seeks to separate herself from him, will be closely scrutinized. Obama was a liability for many Democrats during the 2014 midterm elections and saw his approval ratings sink during the year. Clinton will need to remain loyal enough to the president to maintain his voting coalition while displaying enough independence to appeal to those who have grown weary of Obama. Succeeding a two-term president in your own party is never easy."

675|Eurozone 'no longer has to rescue Greece': German MP|"Berlin (AFP) - Europe no longer needs to rescue Greece as the country has lost its ""systemic relevance"" to the eurozone and its power of political ""blackmail,"" a senior German lawmaker said Wednesday.

Fears of a potential Greek exit from the eurozone have rattled markets since a political crisis in Athens led to early elections, called for late January, in which a leftist anti-austerity party has good prospects of winning, threatening to unwind painful reforms.

Michael Fuchs, deputy parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, suggested the idea of Greece breaching its commitments to creditors and eventually leaving the single currency bloc was no longer a doomsday scenario.

""The situation is entirely different than three years ago,"" Fuchs told the Rheinische Post daily.

""The times when we had to rescue Greece are over. There is no potential for blackmail anymore. Greece is no longer of systemic relevance for the euro.""

He stressed that ""if Alexis Tsipras of the Greek leftist party Syriza believes he can roll back the reform efforts and savings measures of Greece, then the troika will also have to roll back the loans for Greece"".

Syriza, currently the front-runner in polls, has pledged to unwind many of the reforms imposed by the so-called ""troika"" of the International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank -- by cutting taxes and increasing state aid and public services.

Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras warned Tuesday that the financially-stricken nation may be forced out of the eurozone if the election is won by Syriza.

The European Union has renewed its calls on Greeks to stick by the often painful reforms adopted as part of a massive international bailout for the eurozone member state."
676|Islamic State ask on Twitter how to kill captured Jordanian pilot|"Islamic State ask on Twitter how to kill captured Jordanian pilot

Ohio Standard Wednesday 31st December, 2014

• The pilot, Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh, 26, a first lieutenant in Jordan's air force, was captured after his F-16 jet crash-landed near the Syrian city of Raqqa

• According to Vocative, some of the ideas shared by ISIS followers to kill Moaz include beheading him, burning him alive and running him over with a bulldozer.

• But people have also taken to Twitter to post on a hashtag that translates as ""We are all Moaz"", praising the pilot and offering messages of support for his family.

DAMASCUS/LONDON - Islamic State militants in Syria have invited suggestions on Twitter on the best way to kill a Jordanian pilot captured last week with their gruesome Arabic hashtag ""Suggest a Way to Kill the Jordanian Pilot Pig"" being retweeted over a thousand times.

The pilot, Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh, 26, a first lieutenant in Jordan's air force, was captured after his F-16 jet crash-landed near the Syrian city of Raqqa, which is held by ISIS (also known as ISIL).

Jordan has threatened the IS with ""grave consequences"" if the pilot is harmed, while the Islamists have demanded that Jordan quit the US-led coalition and release several prisoners in exchange for his release.

Several ISIS-affiliated Twitter accounts have asked the organization's followers to suggest ways of killing Kaseasbeh.

Kasaesbeh, also known as Moaz, was captured by IS fighters on Christmas Eve.

The IS published an interview with the pilot in Dabiq, its monthly English-language magazine, last week. The piece ends with the question ""Do you know what the Islamic State will do with you?"" To which Al-Kasasbeh replies: ""Yes They will kill me"".

According to Vocative, some of the ideas shared by ISIS followers to kill Moaz include beheading him, burning him alive and running him over with a bulldozer.

Many of the Twitter posts contained graphic embedded images, including photographs of beheadings and of wounded children. One showed a steamroller captioned with a message that translates into ""Goodbye Moaz"", while another featured a stock picture saying ""Nothing better than the axe"".

Another hashtag that translates as ""We all want to slaughter Moaz"" has been tweeted thousands of times too. That hashtag featured doctored images of the pilot with IS soldiers, including one of the man being held by ""Jihadi John"", the IS member that the group claims was behind the killing of many of the British and US men shown in videos released this year.

But people have also taken to Twitter to post on a hashtag that translates as ""We are all Moaz"", praising the pilot and offering messages of support for his family.

One participant, claiming to be the mother of a Syrian man killed by a coalition air strike, suggested that Kaseasbeh should be ""impaled and hung on a pole so that he dies slowly. And it would be mercy to kill him by gun or a knife"".

Moaz's plane was the first US-led coalition aircraft to be lost on IS territory since air strikes began in September.

The jihadist group claimed it had shot down the jet with a heat-seeking missile near the city of Raqqa.

But the Jordanian government and U.S. Central Command described the incident as an aircraft crash and adamantly stated that it was not shot down by ISIS.

677|Modi stands for Murder of Democratic India, says Jairam Ramesh|"Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Tuesday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying the country has been “trapped” in a culture of ‘NAMO’ or ‘No Action, Message Only’, ever since the BJP came to power at the Centre.

Reacting to the government taking the ordinance route to implement major laws like the one on land acquisition, the Congress leader said “now ‘MODI’ stands for ‘Murder of Democratic India’.”

He was reacting in a jocular vein to Modi’s usage of abbreviations like ABCD (Avoid, Bypass, Confuse, Delay) which the prime minister said should be replaced by ‘ROAD’ that stands for Responsibility, Ownership, Accountability, Discipline.

“The country is now trapped in ‘NAMO’ or ‘No Action Message Only’, Ramesh said. NAMO, denoting the first letters in the prime minister’s name, was used extensively for sloganeering and campaigning by the BJP during the elections.

Stressing on collective decision-making, Modi, at a day-long workshop on the ‘Make in India’ campaign on Monday had said that silos in government functioning have been demolished.

“Government is generally trapped in ‘ABCD’ culture from top to bottom…. A means Avoid, B-Bypass, C-Confuse, D-Delay. Our efforts is to move from this culture to ‘ROAD’ where R stands for Responsibility, O-Ownership, A-Accountability, D-Discipline. We are committed to moving towards this roadmap,” he said.

678|Putin uses his New Year's speech to hail Russia's annexation of Crimea as historic|"

Vladimir Isachenkov, The Associated Press





MOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has used his New Year's speech to hail his country's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula as an achievement that will ""forever remain a landmark in the national history.""

Putin's comment in his pre-recorded annual address on Wednesday already has been broadcast in Russia's far eastern regions, where the holiday was celebrated hours ahead of Moscow, given the time difference.

The Kremlin also published several dozen New Year's messages that Putin has sent to heads of state and international organizations, including one to President Barack Obama.

Putin reminded Obama of the upcoming 70th anniversary of the allied victory in World War II, and said that should serve as a reminder of ""the responsibility that Russia and the United States bear for maintaining peace and international stability."" Moscow is anxious for those bilateral relations to advance, but only as long as there is ""equality and mutual respect.""

After Ukraine's former Russia-friendly president was driven from power in February, Moscow sent troops to overtake Crimea, home to a Russian naval base. Those forces blocked Ukrainian military garrisons and set the stage for a hastily called referendum on Crimea joining Russia, which Ukraine and the West rejected as illegal.

The West has imposed crippling sanctions against Russia over the annexation of Crimea and Moscow's support for a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where the fighting between the government troops and the rebels has killed more than 4,700 since April.

Under the combined blow of the sanctions and slumping oil prices, the Russian ruble has lost about half its value this year and the national economy has drifted into recession. Putin has promised that the economy will rebound in two years, but he has failed to offer a specific plan for easing Russia's heavy dependence on oil and gas revenues.

In his speech, Putin praised Crimea's ""return home,"" a view widely backed by many Russians who saw Ukraine's control over the Black Sea region a historic injustice. Crimea only became part of Ukraine when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave the peninsula to his native land in 1954. That mattered little until the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 and Crimea ended up in an independent Ukraine.

Experts have warned that Putin's popularity, which soared after the annexation of Crimea, could fizzle quickly amid his nation's economic downturn. But the Russian leader refrained from directly referring to Russia's economic woes in his New Year address, praising his citizens for their readiness to stay united ""both in days of triumphs and at a time of trials"" and to maintain their ""unity and solidarity."""
679|UK firm sets further drilling in Itogon|"ECR Minerals Plc, operator of the Itogon gold exploration project in Benguet, said it would start on Jan. 15 the second phase of its drilling program to further define mineral resources in the area.

The UK-based company has the right to earn a 50-percent interest in the project.

The company said the drilling program was mainly intended to provide information on the orientation of the interpreted mineralized structures and the extent of near-surface mineralization.

“(This) phase of drilling at the Itogon project will be a crucial one (as) the results of the first phase were encouraging but expectedly left a number of geological questions unanswered,” said ECR chief executive Stephen Clayson.

Clayson said the hope was that the second phase would enable a geological interpretation for the main prospect area at Itogon to be set out with confidence, considering that such interpretation would then guide decisions regarding further work.

“The second phase had been planned to commence during the final quarter of 2014, but additional time to consider the exploration data generated by ECR to date was deemed necessary before the program could be finalized,” he said.

The earlier drilling program produced results as promising as ore samples containing 119.53 grams of gold per ton, located at just about 10 meters from the surface."

The disaster happened shortly before midnight on Wednesday as people packed the Bund area to usher in 2015.

Victims' families clash with security personnel at a Shanghai hospital

TThThThe official news agency Xinhua said a Taiwanese person was among the dead, and that 25 of those killed were women.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has demanded an immediate investigation.

It was not immediately clear what triggered the stampede, but state media and a witness said the incident was caused when people tried picking up fake money thrown from a building.

A makeshift memorial at the site of the stampede on the Bund

A man who brought one of the injured to a local hospital for treatment said fake money had been thrown down from a bar above the street as part of a New Year's celebration.

People rushed to pick up the money, triggering the stampede, said the man, who declined to be identified.

But Xinhua reported that surveillance footage showed the notes had been thrown after the stampede, at 11.47 pm, citing the Shanghai police official microblog.

Local TV reported authorities were investigating the money-throwing incident, but attributed the cause of the stampede to people slipping and falling in crowded conditions.

In an unusually critical commentary, Xinhua said the tragedy was a ""wake-up call that the world's second-largest economy is still a developing country which has fragile social management.""

Authorities had shown some concern about crowd control in the days leading up to New Year's Eve.

They had cancelled an annual 3D laser show on the Bund that last year attracted around 300,000 people.

The State Council gave the go-ahead earlier this month for Guangdong, Tianjin and Fujian to set up free-trade zones in their jurisdictions, a little over a year after it gave green light to one in Shanghai.



The Guangdong zone will cover 116 sq km, taking in parts of Guangzhou's Nansha New Area, Qianhai and Shekou in Shenzhen as well as Hengqin in Zhuhai.



Xinhua said the Guangdong zone would deepen cooperation with Hong Kong and Macau while transforming systems for cross-border cooperation.

Under the umbrella of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, the Guangdong zone would break up obstacles in the way of businesses from Hong Kong and Macau. It would also work with the two regions to align local foreign trade rules with international standards.



Qianhai would work with Hong Kong on financial measures; Hengqin would explore cooperation with Macau; and Nansha would take advantage of its central location in the Pearl River Delta, the report quoted Li Zhijian, a researcher involved in the zone's planning, as saying.



Fujian's zone will focus on cooperation with Taiwan to attract more foreign investment and help businesses in the province head offshore. Xinhua said the Fujian zone could strengthen links with Taiwan in aviation logistics, financial services, trade and cultural industries. The Tianjin FTZ is expected to help drive integrated development in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. (macaunews/xinhua)

News and Sentinel Wednesday 31st December, 2014

CLEVELAND (AP) -- A top official with the Cleveland branch of the NAACP says he has no confidence the city will make changes within the police department without federal oversight. Civil rights attorney Michael Nelson said Tuesday that the eventual court-ordered agreement between Cleveland and the U.S. Department of Justice will have to remain in place for years because the city cannot be relied on to make changes on its own. The DOJ issued a blistering report earlier this month that said an investigation had found a pattern and practice of Cleveland police officers using excessive force and violating people's civil rights. The city and DOJ have begun negotiating the terms of a consent decree that a federal judge must approve and an independent monitor will oversee. The NAACP has created a list of changes it wants adopted as part of the decree, to include: giving the Civilian Review Board authority to recommend discipline against police officers; the adoption of anti-profiling legislation; revising search and seizure policies; requiring officers to take periodic psychological exams; revising union contracts to make it easier to fire officers; and recruiting more minorities and women. A spokesman for the city declined to comment Tuesday. Mayor Frank Jackson has acknowledged there are problems within the police department but has insisted they are not systemic. Jackson also has noted that he asked the DOJ to review the police department's policies and procedures. The investi...

685|13 killed in fresh Boko Haram attack in Nigeria's Borno|"World Bulletin / News Desk

At least 13 people were killed in a new attack by suspected Boko Haram militants on a remote community in Nigeria's northeastern Borno State.

Militants in a 4-wheel drive vehicle and about five motorcycles attacked Kautikari at about 8pm local time on Monday, Ali Watika, a local resident who had fled to Chibok, a town some 10kms away, told The Anadolu Agency by phone on Wednesday.

He recalled that the insurgents first fired shots into houses to force residents out and then open fire, killing at least 13 people.

Watika said he saw corpses of the slain residents while fleeing the town on Tuesday morning.

A military source said troops are already in the town and feared the death toll could be higher.

He said the insurgents had burnt many houses and commercial centers in the town.

Boko Haram attacked Kautikari in mid-June, killing at least 21 people.

On April 14, Boko Haram militants abducted 276 girls from their school dormitories in Chibok, according to official accounts.

Boko Haram kingpin Abubakar Shekau later claimed responsibility for the abductions, offering to trade the kidnapped girls for detained militants held by the Nigerian authorities.

Since then communities near Chibok have come under heavy attacks by the insurgents.

Boko Haram raided Chibok itself in November killing at least 12 people.

For the last five years, Nigeria has battled a fierce Boko Haram insurgency that has ravaged the country's volatile northeastern region.

A seemingly emboldened Boko Haram recently stepped up its militant activity even further, seizing several areas in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states, where it has declared a self-styled ""Islamic caliphate.""

Several residents have fled to Maiduguri, Borno's provincial capital, and few areas considered safer in the three states."
686|The real, and not so real, in risk to the world|"The main purpose of year-end reviews, of course, is to hold the ads apart. But they can also serve as a kind of annual checkup on the political health — and also on the economic, demographic and even physical health — of the planet and its teeming human population. So imagine that we are a panel of high-priced medicos reviewing the health status of our most important client, the human race.

The first thing to note is that the client is still piling on weight at an alarming rate — up from two billion units to seven billion in the past seventy-five years — but continues to thrive, for the most part. And most of the ailments that it worries about are mere hypochondria.

Take, for example, the widespread concern (at least in the media and among what Bob Fisk calls the ""think-tank mountebanks"") that the emergence of the so-called Islamic State in the no man's land between Iraq and Syria will lead to catastrophe. There will allegedly be a surge in terrorist attacks around the world, a Sunni-Shia religious war spanning the entire Middle East, or even a global religious war between Muslims and everybody else.

The Sunni fanatics and the Shia fanatics are far too busy trying to kill each other to have time to spare for attacking non-Muslims. (Besides, most Muslims don't want to attack anybody; they just want to be left in peace.) Quite a lot of the slaughter in Iraq and Syria is driven by religion, but we are still a long way from a religious conflict that directly involves the really important states of the Middle East: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran.

Even the anticipated surge in terrorist attacks outside the region is not likely to come to pass. The only strategic purpose for such attacks by any organized group of Islamist extremists is to gain support and recruits within their own region. If they can lure Western powers into killing lots of Muslims in their region, then their cause will prosper locally.

As it turns out, Islamic State has not even needed to carry out terrorist attacks in the West to achieve this goal. Videos of Western hostages being beheaded have been enough to get the bombing going again, and Western governments are no more troubled by the sheer pointlessness of the bombing than they were in the past. Both sides are playing for the home audience, and really don't care much about the impact of their actions on the alleged enemy.

The whole ""Islamic State"" panic is a tempest in a fairly small teacup. The casualties are small, and the entire region matters little economically or strategically except to its own inhabitants. Even in the unlikely event that a Sunni-Shia religious war should engulf the whole of the Middle East, it would have no more effect on the rest of the planet than the European wars of religion four centuries ago had on the Middle East. That is to say, hardly any.

So in terms of the global system's health, the rise of radical Islamism is not a life-threatening disease. It's a local infection that will probably have to run its course. If it really gets bad, some quarantine measures may be needed, but this is not Ebola.

Speaking of which, the Ebola outbreak in Africa seems on the way to being contained, although it will probably remain as a low-level chronic problem in the three West African countries where it reached epidemic status: Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. There is a small risk that Ebola might take root in a densely populated country whose people travel widely, like Nigeria or, even worse, India, but so far, so good.

The other great shock of 2014 was a war in Europe. The Ukrainian revolution of last February was a messy and complicated business, but it need not have ended in Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and in a Russian-backed separatist war in Ukraine's two easternmost provinces.

We owe that mainly to Russian President Vladimir Putin's world-view as a former agent of the KGB, the Soviet secret police, which (as the old saying had it) thwarted 10 anti-Soviet plots for every one that actually existed.

The KGB was full of very clever people — indeed, it was the most intelligent and best informed part of the old Soviet regime, one of the world's strongholds of institutionalized stupidity — but it was also a nest of paranoid fantasists. You may debate to your heart's content whether this was a Russian cultural phenomenon or an extreme case of the disease that infects every great-power spy agency, but that's why Putin reacted the way he did.

Western European governments are so divided and introspective that they could not come up with a credible plan to boil an egg, and they care very little about the parts of Eastern Europe beyond the European Union's borders. The only section of the American population that sees President Obama's administration as capable of hatching a plot is the extreme right, and they think he's a foreign-born Communist plotting the overthrow of the United States.

Various Western politicians showed up in Kiev to cheer the protesters on, but these were just the usual suspects taking advantage of a good photo op. Their real intended audience, as usual, was back home. As for NATO, it is another Cold War institution that has long outlived its purpose, but it no more wants to bring Ukraine into the fold than it longs to recruit Mongolia as a member. Too much trouble, and no profit whatever.

There was no Western plot, but Putin is driven by the belief that there was. He has taken Russia into a confrontation with the West that it cannot win, and the country's economy is already crumbling under the twin strains of coping with Western sanctions and the collapse of the oil price. He is finding it almost impossible to back away without losing face, but he has nothing to gain by continuing the conflict, either. Risk of a new Cold War: minimal.

So far the patient's health is looking pretty good. There is the usual clutter of minor ailments — a mini-civil war here (Libya, South Sudan), civil rights protesters under attack there (Hong Kong, Missouri) — and there is a significant possibility that next year will bring another recession. That's as inevitable as catching a cold once in a while. But there has been nothing really out of the ordinary this year, nothing that sets off alarm bells.

The only big worry the doctors have is the same one that has bothered them for the past 25 years: the patient simply won't stop smoking. Their increasingly grave warnings are met with empty promises to cut back or quit entirely, but not right now, just some time far in the future. Maybe.

The news flows in endlessly, and some of it has significant impact on many people's lives — a billion people's lives when India elects a new prime minister or China gets an (unelected) new president, both of which happened this year. But truly fundamental change is much rarer than people think (and than the media encourage them to think). Now that the threat of large-scale nuclear war has died down, only one thing qualifies.

Climate change is the spectre at every feast, the unstoppable rot that undermines every positive development. The failure at Copenhagen in 2009 bleeds indistinguishably into the fudge at Durban in 2011 and on into the feeble compromise in Lima in 2014, which sets us up for the bigger disappointment of Paris in 2015. And even if by some miracle we get a useful agreement in Paris next year, nothing will actually be done until 2020.

The patient thinks there's still plenty of time to quit. There isn't."

SPECIAL TO FLORIDA W EKLY

Florida is the place that counts, New York.

The Big Apple is no longer No. 1. Or even No. 2.

By adding an average of 803 new residents each day between July 1, 2013 and July 1, 2014, Florida passed New York to become the nation’s third most populous state, according to U.S. Census Bureau state population estimates released Dec. 23.

Florida’s population grew by 293,000 over this period, reaching 19.9 million. The population of New York increased by 51,000 to 19.7 million, according to the bureau.

California remained the nation’s most populous state in 2014, with 38.8 million residents, followed by Texas, at 27.0 million. Although the list of the 10 most populous states overall was unchanged, two other states did change positions, as North Carolina moved past Michigan to take the ninth spot.

Another milestone took place in Georgia (ranked eighth), which saw its population surpass 10 million for the first time.

North Dakota was the nation’s fastestgrowing state over the last year. Its population increased 2.2 percent, followed by the 1.7 percent growth in Nevada and Texas. Each of the 10 fastest-growing states was in the South or West with the exception of North Dakota.

Six states lost population between July 1, 2013, and July 1, 2014: Illinois (9,972 or -0.08 percent), West Virginia (3,269 or -0.18 percent), Connecticut (2,664 or -0.07 percent), New Mexico (1,323 or -0.06 percent, Alaska (527 or -0.07 percent) and Vermont (293 or -0.05 percent).

The United States as a whole saw its population increase by 2.4 million to 318.9 million, or 0.75 percent.

In addition to the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the new statistics also include estimates for Puerto Rico. On July 1, 2014, Puerto Rico had an estimated population of 3.5 million, a decline of 47,000, or 1.3 percent, from one year earlier.

The Census Bureau produces population estimates each year, allowing the public to gauge the growth and demographic composition of the nation, states and communities. These statistics use administrative data to estimate population change between census years, using the decennial census count as a starting point. Local governments use estimates to locate services, and estimates are used by the private sector to locate businesses.

The Census Bureau also released estimates of the number of people 18 and older in the U.S., states and Puerto Rico. The downloadable file also includes total population and the percentage of people 18 and older. Internet address:

During 2015, the Census Bureau will release estimates of the 2014 population of counties, cities and towns, and metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas as well as national, state and county population estimates by age, sex, race and Hispanic origin.

688|Plans submitted to 'rediscover the soul' of Manchester's landmark Palace Hotel|"A multi-million pound vision for Manchester’s iconic Palace hotel has been revealed - aimed at ‘rediscovering the soul’ of the Victorian gem.

Architects have submitted designs for a major overhaul of the Oxford Road landmark, funded by the American investors who bought it last year.

Starwood Capital want to return the grand hotel to its former glory, claiming it has become ‘corporate and lifeless’ in recent years.

Guest bedrooms, suites, wining and dining areas will all get a full-scale upgrade under the masterplan.

Meanwhile a new terrace called the ‘Waterhouse Way’, using outside space off Whitworth Street currently used as a service area, will be created - potentially creating a new entrance at the back.

It will link the main Alfred Waterhouse building with the Excalibur block behind it - creating a new walkway that could be used as a courtyard, event space or outside area for the Tempus restaurant.

The plans - which seek listed building consent - say that in recent years the Palace has been targeted primarily at conferences and big groups of business people, leading to ‘unsympathetic alterations’.

VIEW GALLERY

“The effect has created a corporate and lifeless feel’, according to the application.

Instead the move aims to ‘completely’ transform what it describes as ‘an amazing historic building’.

General manager Richard Morrell told the M.E.N: “This is a significant investment which was needed for an iconic building - and it’s an exciting time to see it being replenished into one of the greatest hotels in the north of England.”

Completed in 1895, the Palace was designed by Alfred Waterhouse - the renowned architect behind both Manchester town hall and Manchester university - as a home for insurance firm Refuge Assurance.

It remained in use by the company for nearly a century until it departed for Cheshire in 1987. After lying vacant for several more years, the landmark was turned into a hotel in 1996.

Starwood bought operators Principal Hayley in February 2013, taking control not only of the Palace but also seven other grand old hotels in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds and York.

It aims to now turn them into a new brand of ‘colourful and soulful lifestyle hotels’."

691|Divide-and-conquer politics could fatally destabilise Pakistan|"OPINION

Bloodshed: Relatives mourn over the coffin of Mohammed Ali Khan, 15, after the school massacre in Peshawar. Photo: Reuters

In the mid-1990s, I shared a house with a colleague from Pakistan's Saraiki people.

In those days Pakistan was riven by conflict between the state and the MQM, a party that represented Mohajirs (""migrants"") - Muslim Indians who migrated to what is now Pakistan from the time of partition. The government of the late Benazir Bhutto brought a paramilitary force called the Rangers onto the streets of Karachi to combat the MQM, and its supporters were periodically cut down in what the authorities described as ""encounters"".

One evening my Saraiki friend brought round a fellow Pakistani - a big, bluff Pashtun. In the 1980s, Pashtuns and Mohajirs had fought each other in brutal turf wars for control of Karachi, and this fellow had clear ideas about the need of the hour.

Lost lives: Students hold a vigil for the victims of the Taliban attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar. Photo: Reuters

""You know what Ayub Khan would have done?"" he asked, referring to the country's dictator of the 1960s. ""You take one out of every 10 Mohajirs and bang"" - his fingers made the universal symbol for a gun - ""no more MQM problem, hai na [don't you think]?""

That logic surfaced again last week after the appalling massacre of children and their teachers at the Army Public School in Peshawar. The moratorium on the death penalty was lifted, followed by news that 500 convicts had ""exhausted all appeals"" and would be put to death ""in the coming weeks"".

And so, once again, the Pakistani authorities try to slaughter their way out of a political problem.

Force demanded: Supporters of Pakistan's MQM political party call for harsh measures at a rally in Karachi. Photo: AP

Having begun its life as two pieces torn from the fabric of British India, Pakistan has struggled ever since to assert its integrity. As early as the 1950s its leaders devised the ""One Unit"" policy, making the country's western half, with its diverse array of ethnic groups, a single Urdu-speaking entity for administrative purposes. The main motive for this fiction was to counterbalance the massive population and growing power of the Bengali-speaking east.

When the east won a general election and the right to rule the nation, the west's response was military: Operation Searchlight, in which Bengalis of every stripe were rounded up. Yet in trying to enforce unity, the military ended up amputating part of its own territory, which became a new and equally turbulent state: Bangladesh.

In the decades that followed, what remained of Pakistan became a political bed of Procrustes. All those viewed as threats to unity were exiled, internally or externally, or stretched on the rack. Instead of attempting to bridge the nation's divides through constitutional and political reform, the ruling class repeatedly fell back on force.

Balochistan - rich in resources but the country's poorest province - became the site of a rolling insurgency that rendered it ungovernable, allowing the Afghan Taliban's leadership to hide near its capital, Quetta, and their footsoldiers to repeatedly massacre Shiite Hazaras, who then look to our shores for asylum.

In Karachi, the Mohajirs were subjected to Operation Clean-Up, turning the country's largest city into a killing zone. Yet this week, after the school massacre, MQM supporters were out in force calling for the Pakistan Taliban to be ""crushed"".

In the Western world we tend to view both the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban as Islamist forces, yet they are also manifestations - albeit extreme ones - of Pashtun ethnic identity. In an interview in February 2009, Tooryalai Wesa - the governor of Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province - referred to his fellow Pashtuns as a ""nationality"" and noted that ""most of the kings in the history of Afghanistan were from Kandahar. Even the Taliban.""

Cold comfort: A man walks his children home from school in the north-western city of Peshawar after the massacre. Photo: AP

Pakistan's decision to become a rear base in the war against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan gradually brought Pashtuns and their ideas about Islam, society and their rightful place in it into Pakistan's mainstream. Millions crossed the Durand Line between the two countries and set up shop in Peshawar and Karachi, while the Pakistani government in Islamabad hoped that nurturing Pashtun militancy would give it a lever with which to control events in Afghanistan.

Instead it was rising Pashtun sentiment that reshaped Pakistan, most notably in 2010, when the North-West Frontier Province was renamed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a name that identifies the region with its Pakhtun (or Pashtun) population and was immediately the subject of protests by other ethnic groups there.

In the wake of the Peshawar massacre, Pakistan has revived long-repeated promises to repatriate the Afghan refugees and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has vowed to pacify the north-west. One of the first executions last week was of an ex-soldier called Arshad Mehmood. The Pakistani media noted the crowd at his funeral, and online readers were divided on what, if anything, such a turnout signified. What can be said without a doubt is that the execution of one man or 500 men by the state has repercussions, both political and social.

There are people in Peshawar and its tribal hinterland and across Pakistan who long for a state that can extend its care and protection into their lives. But there are others - whether they have militant relatives or not - who dread the indiscriminate attentions of Pakistan's armed forces and the whims and evidential standards of its courts. There are even more around the world who love Pakistan and its people but cannot believe that the cure for what ails the state can ever come from the barrel of a gun or a tank, or be fired from a drone. They fear that unless Islamabad can finally absorb the lesson of Bangladesh, Pakistan may become the author of its own demise.

692|Steve Scalise Might Have Just Been a Victim of Bad Hotel Records|"Here's a lesson for you, all you aspiring politicos. When you didn't do something, don't admit to it. Also, when scheduling your candidate to appear in hotel ballrooms, check the rest of the hotel's schedule. And for that matter, unless you're enjoying the culture, music and potent potables of New Orleans, just stay the hell out of Louisiana. Even if you're from there.

Although, yesterday, it was rather clear that Steve Scalise had given a keynote address to a room full of Neo-Nazi continental breakfast afficianados, today, it seems that he might have merely been the victim of bad hotel record keeping. According to Kenny Knight, the white supremacist who organized the annual ""EURO Convention,"" Steve Scalise wasn't actually on the schedule for the event itself. Instead, Scalise spoke to a group of community activists that Knight also organizes, and which Scalise also happened to be a part of, but who are less ""White Power"" and more ""Tuesday Night Bingo.""

Knight said on Tuesday that it’s “totally incorrect” to say Scalise spoke at that convention. “He spoke early in the day to a contingent of people, prior to the conference kicking off,” Knight said. “He was not there as a guest speaker at the conference.” According to Knight, he and Scalise were neighbors in 2002, living in the Old Jefferson neighborhood outside New Orleans. They were friendly and lived within a few blocks of each other. Knight recalls that Scalise would beep the horn and wave at him if he drove by in his car. “Now and then I’d see him at a Republican function, we’d say hello, but we never exchanged any philosophy ideas,” Knight said.

Apparently, Neo-Nazis also need event management and Knight was put in charge of booking the hotel conference space and setting up refreshments for EURO conference attendees. Since he had to book the space for the whole day, he decided to use the space for Jefferson Civic Heights Association's annual meeting, invited his neighbors, Rep. Steve Scalise, a representative from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Association (who chatted about neighborhood watch) and a speaker from the Red Cross (who instructed attendees in CPR). There was bleed over from one event to the next, white supremacist one, but according to Knight, it was pretty minimal (though, to be fair, Knight also claims that the EURO conference is just a simple meeting of middle-aged Christians).

Of course, Scalise has still publicly admitted to addressing the convention. No matter what, it's still an error in judgment, and Scalise's relationship with Knight is questionable at best. But it's a lot less overtly problematic if he just, say, happened to stay a little longer at a speech to chat over tea and cookies with a bunch of his neighbors and a couple of people who think Hitler was just misunderstood. Not a lot, but less."
693|L&T Hyderabad metro tries communication-based automatic train operation|"L&T Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited has successfully test run a train in Automatic Train Operation (ATO) mode here for the first time on Indian soil.

Hyderabad Metro is the first Indian metro project to implement Communication Based Train Control system. In this mode, train operates on its own and self controls its movement, speed, performance etc., with automatic application of brakes without intervention of the train driver.

The function of the driver is only to press a button to close the doors at stations and it is a prelude to completely driverless mode which Hyderabad Metro can upgrade any time it wants, NVS Reddy, MD, Hyderabad Metrol Rail Limited, said.

Simon Lee, a Hongkong based veteran in CBTC technology is supervising the Hyderabad Metro signalling system along with engineers of L&TMRHL and Thales who participated in the test run.

French company Thales has provided the technology and equipment for Hyderabad Metro signalling system, a radio communication based system which controls movement of trains through continuous two-way digital communication between trains and trackside equipment.

The main Operation Control Centre serves as the nerve centre for remote controlling and operation of the entire 72 km Hyderabad Metro Rail system.

The total Metro Rail system is divided into six zones, each controlled by a Zone Controller. Several sophisticated sub-systems ensure fail-safe protection mechanism against train collisions, speed regulation, programmed stopping, door control and other functions.

Automatic monitoring of train movement and performance removes any possibility of human error and prevent train collisions due to driver passing train beyond danger signal, which can happen in normal railway working. The system facilitates running of trains with one and a half minute (90 sec) frequency.

After Hyderabad Metro, the next phase of Delhi Metro has also opted for this technology.

697|Listen up, America: 12 lessons from Colorado’s first year of legal pot|"Listen up, America: 12 lessons from Colorado’s first year of legal pot

We’ve hounded the experts while on holiday to bring you an invaluable list drawn from the nation’s latest greatest experiment in permissibility: Here’s a dozen Colorado-legalized-it lessons. Enjoy responsibly.

Regulate it: “First and foremost we learned that regulation works,” said Mason Tvert, Communications Director at the Marijuana Policy Project. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of marijuana sales are now taking place in licensed, tax-paying businesses instead of the underground market. Colorado has shown that other states have the ability to take this new approach to marijuana policy.”

Crimes and mispredictions: “Many of the concerns that legalization opponents put forth during the A64 campaign did not come to fruition in the first year,” said Art Way of the Drug Policy Alliance. “That primarily involves a decrease in violent crime in the city of Denver, including burglaries.” Other fears, such as legalization dampening tourism and the broader economy, also appear unfounded. Tvert points out that more than 18,000 people have become licensed to work in the industry, which also supports ancillary industries from real estate to energy. Colorado’s economy has continued to improve through legalization with big companies like Google choosing to expand operations here. Ski resorts also report record highs in tourism.

Voters don’t regret it: In fact, the Durango Herald reports that 90 percent of those who voted for Amendment 64 say they’d vote for it again.

Don’t DARE: “The state’s largest survey of middle and high school students found that there was no increase in marijuana use among high school and middle school students and that’s been the trend since 2009,” said Tvert. “That’s not to say that it’s the result of the legalization system, but it’s also clear that it’s not driving use up like we heard opponents say it would.” Tvert also noted that teen dropout rates have continued to decline during legalization.

Criminal justice reform: Way says one of the most encouraging takeaways from the first year of legalization is how few people have been taken away. “Marijuana cases, charges and arrests have all plummeted. Meanwhile, intent to distribute charges have not risen, especially in communities of color, which was a personal fear of mine.”

Don’t be anti-social: “It was short sighted to not take into consideration that people will want to consume cannabis in a social setting,” said Jane West of Edible Events and Women Grow. A leading woman in the industry pushing for a classier model of consumption, West says events like Classically Cannabis with the Colorado Symphony at Red Rocks shouldn’t be so hard to put on. “Right now your only option is to break the law,” she said. West suggests a formal permitting process more or less identical to the one already in place for alcohol.

You’re not paranoid, everyone else is high: Just kidding. Use amongst adults also doesn’t seem to have increased, hovering at roughly 1 in 4. via Durango Herald.

No Maureen Dowd about it: “I think we underestimated both the demand for edibles and the education necessary for this new consumer market,” said West. Tvert agreed, adding, “People didn’t really think about just how engrained alcohol is into our culture. For example, Maureen Dowd would never have come to town, sat in bar, ordered a martini, drunk it really quick and said, “Wow I don’t feel anything,” and then immediately repeated the process five more times. People know the difference between a shot of tequila and a glass of wine. When it comes to marijuana, because it’s been illegal without much discussion of its effects geared towards responsible use, people aren’t aware of the effects these products have or how long it takes to feel them. What we have is a cultural element of inexperience with marijuana.”

Explain, don’t contain: When it comes to helping folks use edibles safely, advocates say the approach should be more about explanation than regulation. Mason says the next step should be labeling that’s more descriptive and specific in terms of the timing and impact of your weed gummies. Edible makers and marijuana advocates quickly took it on themselves to do just that with their “Start low, go slow,” campaign (featuring Maureen Dowd-esque model). The industry now encourages all new users of edibles to begin with 5mg. An approach industry folks aren’t such a big fan of? The state legislature’s move last session requiring marijuana products to be sold and kept in child-proof packaging. “For me personally I think childproof packaging is excessive and punitive,” said West. “It’s not the same regulation as for alcohol or other things in the home — cleaning products, for example — that are also dangerous. It’s created a very expensive undue burden on edibles companies.”

Momma’s lil helper: “I’m 38 with two kids and I think that THC/cannabis is a safer alternative substance of choice for women in my demographic, who are prescribed more antidepressants than any other group of Americans,” said West, adding that a range of very low-dose, high-quality tinctures and edibles like mints are making it easier for folks to try a little TCH when they might otherwise take a benzo-based pill. “Cannabis comes with letting things go and slowing down a very busy mind — which is what keeps most women up at night. I do think it’s a healthy alternative substance to try first before prescription medication.”

No perfect system: “We still see state legislatures around the country taking on alcohol regulation issues every year,” Tvert points out. “So the most important rule is that this [legalized marijuana] is an evolving system that is going to change over the course of history. It’s never going to be finished in other words.”

Who cares, man: A cannabinoidal fog has yet to settle upon Denver, squalor/ torpor yet to plague the streets and you still can’t overdose on THC. “The lesson learned is that life will continue to go on except marijuana will be legal,” said Tvert. “If you’re not interested in it, you won’t notice much difference.”

700|Morocco Bans ‘Exodus’ Film, Causes Controversy|"(AP). Morocco has banned Ridley Scott’s biblical epic “Exodus,” provoking an angry response by politicians and filmmakers in this North African country.

Morocco’s film commission issued a letter to all cinemas on Saturday, notifying them that the film, which portrays the story of Moses, has been banned for possibly portraying God in the scene of Moses’ revelation.

Islam and Morocco law both forbid the public display of images of God.

The movie has already been banned in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

However, a party in Morocco’s governing coalition has criticized the ban as “incomprehensible,” especially to a film industry that is important to Morocco. Morocco is a major destination for foreign movies.

“There should have been a more intelligent handling of this affair in a way that didn’t damage the image of the kingdom and preserves the freedom of creation and art,” the Progressive Socialist Party said in a statement that appeared in the press on Wednesday.

Morocco’s governing coalition is led by an Islamist party, though most power resides with the king.

The country’s organization of filmmakers also criticized the ban, calling it “ridiculous and irrational.”

“This decision risks discouraging film investment in our country and sending foreign productions to other destinations,” Abderrahman Tazi, the group’s chief, said in a statement issued Tuesday.

The Moroccan Cinema Commission’s decision to ban “Exodus” involved a scene in which a child, which could be interpreted as representing God, speaks to Moses.

The commission had originally authorized the film, but its leader, Sarim Fassi-Fihri, said a representative of the Communications Ministry had objections. After a second viewing, the panel banned the movie.

Minister of Communication Mustapha Khalfi confirmed that his ministry that raised objections to the film.

“All members of the commission made this decision and it has nothing to do with the freedom of expression,” he told The Associated Press."

Guam - High school students can learn how to program robots and solar panels with GCC's sustainable workshops. The Guam Community College has been hosting a five-day series that ended this afternoon.

Roughly 20 high school students from around the island came together to learn sustainable and technical skills such as solar photovoltaics and robotics, with GCC sustainability coordinator Francisco Palacios telling KUAM News, ""Right now we are introducing the students to their first taste of installing a 55-watt solar battery backup system. This is very important because solar is a growing industry here.""

GCC hopes to better prepare students for highly technical careers such as solar installation, design, and robotics. ""We're going to be introducing students to robotics - they're going to be building these highly complex level robots as well as programming the robots themselves, but the one thing we want to integrate in their minds is the idea of sustainability,"" Palacios explained.

Palacios emphasizes that the program is more than just about career opportunities, but also about keeping our island green. Theana Lynn Aromin and Justin Taijeron, students attending the workshop, seemed to share these sentiments. She said, ""I came here today because I thought it would be cool to learn about sustainable technologies 0030 and ways to prevent fossil fuels and stuff like that."" And Taijeron added, ""We're learning about renewable energy and the benefits of it, like what it can do for our island and how we can reduce the cost of sustainable energy like oil and gas and all that kind of stuff.""

GCC's sustainable workshop series is not only preparing the island's youth for technical careers, but also imparting to them the importance of sustainability.

Lt. Gov. Sue Ellspermann has announced that five municipalities have received Indiana Hardest Hit Fund Blight Elimination Program (BEP) awards in a second round of funding. The combined awards total approximately $4 million to help eliminate blighted and abandoned homes.

The Blight Elimination Program provides an opportunity for local units of government in all 92 Indiana counties to compete for funding to eliminate blighted, vacant and abandoned homes in an effort to decrease foreclosures. The program has made $75 million available for blight elimination throughout Indiana.

""The Blight Elimination Program continues to provide a valuable resource to communities large and small that have struggled to address abandoned homes,"" said Lt. Governor Sue Ellspermann, who chairs the IHCDA board. ""The additional round of funding allows for further progress to take place in these communities as they are able to transform blighted homes into functional, revitalized spaces that will once again contribute to the local economy.""

In the first round of Division Three funding, nearly $10.8 million was awarded; Alexandria received $355,000, Anderson received $1.4 million, Elwood received $625,000, Coatesville received $15,000, Evansville received $1.7 million, Muncie received $2.9 million, Terre Haute received $650,00, Elkhart County received $2.7 million and Vigo County received $425,000.

Anderson was awarded nearly $1.3 million to demolish, green and maintain 59 blighted residential properties. This will complement existing investment or redevelopment plans.

Daleville received an award of $43,000 to address two blighted structures. Town officials believe that the demolition, greening and maintenance of the two properties will positively impact public safety.

Tucson Post Wednesday 31st December, 2014

• The burger chain grew out of a hot dog stand

• Files for an IPO to raise up to $100 million

• Also operates in several international locations

NEW YORK - Their burgers and shakes are indeed Main Street popular but Shake Shack is now all set to test its popularity at the Wall Street with the burger chain going public amid market signals that stock offerings by restaurants have been a hit with investors.

Shake Shack filed for an initial public offering Monday, after 10 years of its humble beginning as a hot dog cart in Manhattan's Madison Square Park. It is seeking to raise $100 million and will list on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol SHAK.

Known for its Shackburgers, flat-top hot dogs and eponymous shakes, the joint was founded by restaurateur Daniel Meyer in 2001.

Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group LLC (USHG) also runs other popular New York eateries, including Blue Smoke, Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, which are not involved in the IPO.

The joint has grown to become a chain with 63 locations around the world, from Istanbul to Dubai.

It opened seven locations in the US in 2013. That drove annual sales up 40 percent to nearly $79 million. The company earned $5.4 million last year.

According to The New York Times, Shake Shack in its filing also disclosed financial data which reveals that its total revenue grew to $82.5 million from $19.5 million in over a three-fiscal-year period ending Dec 25, 2013.

More recently, for the 39 weeks ending Sep 25, it had revenue of $83.76 million, up nearly 41 percent from the same period in 2013.

Net income fell 20 percent, to $3.54 million in that period.

In a letter to potential investors, Meyer and Randy Garutti, Shake Shack's chief executive, said they intended the original location to benefit Madison Square Park.

They said that the restaurant would eventually go to the park as a gift, which would in turn earn a percentage of the revenue.

""And if it really worked, the park would feel safer, and much-needed dollars would be generated to provide funding for the park's robust budget for ongoing maintenance, horticulture and public programming.""

Shack Shake's public offering follows a string of successful IPOs by restaurants this year. These include El Pollo Loco and Zoe's Kitchen.

Zoe's shares are now at double their IPO price while El Pollo shares trade at about 38 percent above their IPO price.

Shares of burger chain Habit Restaurants more than doubled in their trading debut last month."

706|Yemen government spokesman refutes Foreign Ministry statements cutting ties with Iran|"CAIRO — Yemen's internationally recognized government withdrew media statements by its Foreign Ministry officials saying it cut ties with Iran, a government spokesman said Friday.

""Cutting ties with Iran does not align with Yemen's supreme interests,"" said Rageh Badie.

The internationally recognized government has long been accusing Iran of arming and training the country's Shiite rebels known as Houthis. Tehran admits to supporting and advising the rebels, but denies any military aid.

Several government officials blamed the diplomatic mix-up on Foreign Minister Riyad Yasin, with multiple officials telling The Associated Press that Yasin lacks political experience.

Yemen has been torn by a ferocious war between government forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis allied with army units loyal to a former president. The U.N. says at least 2,355 civilians have been killed in fighting in Yemen since March, when the Saudi-led coalition began launching airstrikes.

Earlier in the day, pro- government forces captured a key Houthi encampment near the Bab al-Mandab straight, the strategic southern entrance to the Red Sea and the gateway to the Suez Canal, security officials said.

Friday's fighting in the strategic area has killed 46 fighters and wounded dozens so far from both sides of the conflict, added the officials — who remain neutral in the war that divided the country.

The aim, pro-government officials said, is to open a new front line in the battle for Yemen's third largest city of Taiz, northeast of the straight. The battered city of Taiz, which lies in a province of the same name largely controlled by the Houthis, has long been the site of civilian casualties as Saudi airstrikes as well as rebel mortar shells often hit homes.

All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to brief the media.

Also Friday, a senior operative in Yemen's al-Qaida affiliate condemned the recent bombings of local Shiite mosques by the Islamic State group.

Both al-Qaida and the Islamic State group regard Shiite Muslims as apostates. But in a video released early Friday, Khaled Batarfi said that al-Qaida leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri had both banned the practice of attacking mosques.

The IS group has claimed responsibility for two bombings outside Shiite mosques that killed more than 20 people, saying the attacks were a blow against the Shiite rebels who control the capital, Sanaa. Batarfi said the bombings, ""killed far more Sunnis than Shiites."""
707|New Shocking Details About Executions By Islamic State|"Islamic State last week released a new propaganda video called “The Blood Of Jihad.” The video shows the brainwashing and brutal training of IS recruits. The video also called upon IS followers to attack ‘infidel nations’ such as the United States and Australia.

The release of the video came after the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights – which is monitoring the situation in Syria and Iraq – published new data on the number of people executed by the Islamic State over the last six months. The London-based organization said that 1,878 people were executed–among them at least 1,175 civilians.

Rami Abdulrahman, the head of the monitoring group, said that among those executed were children and women. The number of executed people is probably an underestimation. The Syrian Observatory wrote on its website that the number of people killed by IS is higher than the number documented.

Islamic State has also executed 116 of its fighters since November. These IS members were foreigners who decided to return home.

The group, furthermore, beheaded two U.S. journalists and one American aid worker in an attempt to intimidate the U.S.-led coalition that embarked on an air campaign against the Islamic State.

The Wall Street Journal this weekend published a shocking article about Islamic State child soldiers who received training in beheading. Among those receiving this training was an eight-year-old boy.

WSJ interviewed a 17-year old Syrian child soldier who described how Syrian soldiers were brought to the training in beheading and were forced to their knees. He then described how the soldiers were beheaded and said that it was like “learning to chop an onion.”

In related news, an Islamic State sniper gunned down General Hamid Taqavi, the local commander of Iran’s Al Quds Force in Iraq, on Sunday. The Iranian general served in Iraq as an adviser to the Iraqi army and local Shiite militias in their battle against the advancing troops of the Islamic State."
708|Federal NDP, Liberals take a leaf from Obama playbook|"OTTAWA —Barack Obama’s vote-getting days may be over, but the U.S. president’s campaign machinery and its methods seem destined to be a part of Canada’s federal election in 2015.

New Democrats and Liberals, in a bid to catch up with the Conservatives’ long-held advantage in digital and data campaigning, have been looking south, to U.S. Democrats in particular, for advice on how best to fight the next election here.

From consulting former Obama staffers to sending trainees to work with Democrats in the U.S. mid-terms — to outright imitation — the Liberals and NDP have been amassing the newest tools of the trade to trot out for Canada’s big day at the polls in 2015.

“We’re definitely going to see a lot of Obama tactics at play,” says Jennifer Hollett, a potential candidate in Toronto’s University-Rosedale riding in 2015, who has been at the forefront of the NDP’s efforts to modernize the party’s campaign machinery.

The Liberals’ national director, Jeremy Broadhurst, also acknowledges his party has dipped deeply into the Democrats’ well of knowledge.

“We closely follow developments in American political techniques as we do in a variety of different jurisdictions,” Broadhurst says, adding Obama’s people have much to teach Canadians on recruiting, engaging and mobilizing new volunteers to politics.

Toronto residents may have already had a bit of a sneak preview of Obama: the Sequel (North of 49th Parallel Edition). Peter Tanner, 32, works in Toronto’s financial sector these days but celebrated his 30th birthday working as a data analyst at Obama headquarters in Chicago on election night in 2012.

He wasn’t the only Canadian expatriate working there either — at least four other people among the approximately 50 members of Obama’s analytics team were dual, Canada-U.S. citizens.

“It’s not magic,” Tanner says whenever he’s asked about whether Big Data can win campaigns. However, in close races, analytics can make a big difference, Tanner says, especially if political parties concentrate their data efforts on finding voters beyond the already declared supporters.

The 2015 campaign in Canada could well be close — and it could turn on the ability of all parties to get tuned-out citizens to the polls, as Obama’s team did in 2008 and 2012.

Once back in Canada after the 2012 Obama campaign, Tanner helped out in John Tory’s successful Toronto mayoralty campaign last fall. It gave him a chance to see for himself how some of the U.S. Democratic methods were already migrating north — not just on Tory’s team, but in Olivia Chow’s campaign as well.

Chow had a website, for instance, called gottavote.ca. Obama had a website called gottavote.com.

Chow’s campaign also sent out an appeal for support in which people were invited to click a button titled “I’m In.” The same “I’m In” button also appeared in Obama’s campaign material in 2012.

Hollett, 39, who was head of digital operations for Chow’s campaign, unabashedly admits where she got her inspiration.

“Yeah, gottavote.ca, that was a complete ripoff of what we had seen working in Obama’s campaign,” she says. An enterprising Chow volunteer saw Obama’s website and quickly registered the name in the .ca domain, Hollett says.

If something works, “no need to reinvent the wheel,” she says.

“We were always looking to Obama’s work. . . . I looked at the language. I looked at what they were using. I talked to my friends who had worked on Obama’s campaign and got their feedback.”

Liberals, meanwhile, have been showing that they’re reading the Obama manual too, in large and small ways. The Liberalist database is a modified version of one invented by U.S. Democrats and Broadhurst says the party keeps up an “ongoing relationship” with its developers on how to manage data and field operations.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Democrats circulated postcards in communities, listing for residents which neighbours had voted and which hadn’t. In the 2013 Toronto Centre byelection campaign, Liberals were sent a letter by former interim leader and MP Bob Rae, saying: “When the list of Toronto Centre residents who voted is released, I hope your name is on it.” In the U.S., this has been called “shame-based” campaigning.

Liberal officials were also on hand at a training session by Obama strategists in Ottawa about a year ago, in which attendees learned that the words “should give” worked better in fundraising appeals than the more pleading, “please give.”

Sure enough, the word “should” soon started cropping up in Liberal emails to would-be supporters.

In October, the Broadbent Institute sent 11 trainees to the U.S. for on-the-ground experience in campaign methods, in conjunction with the 270 Strategies consulting firm founded by former Obama campaigners.

Jill Piebiak, a Concordia graduate student who hopes to work with the New Democrats in the next campaign, was one of them. She did a week of training in Chicago and then spent another few weeks in the midst of the Democratic campaign in New Hampshire, learning the intricacies of digital and data campaign strategy.

“The most important thing I learned was the idea of constantly checking in on how you’re performing,” says Piebiak, whose master’s thesis also focused on online, progressive campaigning.

In this brave new world of digital and data campaigning, those who have been absorbing the Obama methods say the No. 1 working principle is to test everything — every tactic, every method, even every word in emails.

“Only use your gut when you don’t have data,” Tanner says, reciting one of the lessons drilled into him while in Chicago.

“Don’t trust your gut,” says Hollett. “Test, test, test.”

For instance, in the 2012 presidential campaign, Obama’s team would send out different versions of emails to supporters every morning, and then watch in each time zone to see which wording generated the most feedback.

For some reason, the word “hey” in the subject line of an email turned out to be the most successful for the Democrats, though Tanner says that doesn’t mean the same will necessarily be true in Canada.

When Tanner talks to audiences about what he learned on the Obama campaign, as he did at a Marketing Magazine conference in Toronto in November, he carefully lays out the ways in which Canada cannot simply take U.S. techniques and make them work here.

The U.S. has a two-party system; Canada has multiple parties. Canada has strict spending limits and privacy rules too, which means campaigners simply don’t have access to the money or the individual voter information for an all-out, data-driven campaign conducting personalized, voter analytics as the Obama team did.

Hollett and Broadhurst agree the differences between Canada and the U.S. are as important as the similarities as their parties look south for campaign intelligence."
709|Teen’s note attributes death to lack of acceptance for transgender identity|"A suicide note left behind by a 17-year-old Ohio teen who died last weekend has sparked debate about transgender youth.

Authorities identified the teen as Joshua Alcorn, who preferred to be known as “Leelah.” WCPO Cincinnati reported that Joshua/Leelah was walking along the southbound lanes of I-71 when she was struck by a tractor trailer at 2:20 a.m on Sunday.

The Ohio State Highway Patrol have not released an official cause of death, but the teen left what is described as a pre-scheduled suicide note on Leelah’s Tumblr account, which appeared after her death. Their investigation is ongoing.

No charges have been filed, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.

“The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living… because I’m transgender,” the Tumblr note read.

The post went on to describe Leelah’s life and how her conservative Christian mother refused to acknowledge her gender when she told her about her transgender identity.

Leelah urged other parents not to make the same mistake.

“That won’t do anything but make them hate themselves. That’s exactly what it did to me,” Leelah wrote on her Tumblr account.

The post went on to describe Leelah’s experience with Christian therapy, stating she never got the help she needed, and recounted her parents taking her out of public school and forbidding her from using social media or contacting friends.

“I’ve decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully…I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound,” the Tumblr post states. “There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life getting worse.”

The Tumblr note ended with Leelah saying she wanted her assets to be donated to the transgender civil rights movement and support groups.

Following the post came a second titled, “Sorry,” apologizing to important people in Leelah’s life. After stifling her wish to transition, Leelah had a message for her parents: “You can’t just control other people like that. That’s messed up.”

According to WCPO Cincinnati, Leelah’s mother Carla Alcorn still declines to recognize Leelah’s gender in a posting on Facebook.

She said her “son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning,"" in the post. “He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck.”

A petition was started on Dec. 30 directed at Carla, asking for Leelah’s preferred name to be put on her headstone in true remembrance.

The petition, on the Change.org website, currently has 22,316 supporters."
710|Verso Settles With U.S. Department of Justice Regarding Pending Acquisition of NewPage|"Settlement Enables Completion of Acquisition in Early January 2015

MEMPHIS, TN--(Marketwired - Dec 31, 2014) - Verso Paper Corp. ( NYSE : VRS), a leading North American producer of printing and specialty papers and pulp, today announced that it has reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice that will permit Verso to proceed with its acquisition of NewPage Holdings Inc. The transaction, valued at approximately $1.4 billion, originally was announced on January 6, 2014. Upon the completion of the NewPage acquisition, Verso will have approximately $3.5 billion in annual sales and approximately 5,800 employees in eight mills across six states.

As part of the settlement process, the United States today filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Verso's proposed acquisition of NewPage would violate the antitrust laws. At the same time, the United States filed a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, will resolve the lawsuit and enable the transaction to proceed. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions.

The proposed settlement requires the divestiture of NewPage's paper mills in Biron, Wisconsin, and Rumford, Maine, as previously announced on October 30, 2014. The proposed settlement will be published in the Federal Register and will be subject to public comment, as required by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (known as the Tunney Act).

Verso expects to complete the NewPage acquisition in early January 2015. NewPage is expected to complete the divestiture of the Biron and Rumford mills to a subsidiary of Catalyst Paper Corporation in connection with Verso's acquisition of NewPage.

""The combination of Verso and NewPage will create a stronger, more stable company that will be better positioned to serve our customers and compete in a competitive global marketplace,"" said David J. Paterson, Verso's president and chief executive officer. ""We are pleased that we were able to address the concerns of the Justice Department while preserving the benefits of the transaction for our stockholders and customers.""

""Although this transaction has been among the most challenging and complex, the resulting combination will create value for all of our constituents, particularly our shareholders,"" said Mark Angelson, the chairman of NewPage. ""We would not have come this far without critical input from the Justice Department and the advisors, key shareholders and directors of both companies.""

Following the completion of the NewPage acquisition, Verso's existing senior leadership team will continue to lead the combined company.

711|Stopping female genital mutilation a difficult challenge|"It would be virtually impossible for authorities to stop people taking children overseas to undergo genital mutilation, unless they have received evidence ahead of time, according to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

Ms Bishop on Wednesday urged relatives or friends to alert authorities if they learned children were being taken abroad to undergo female genital mutilation.

It came as The Guardian Australia reported a Brisbane girl, believed to be aged between four and seven-years-old, was suspected to have been taken by her father, possibly to the west African nation of Gambia, for the procedure.

The Australian Federal Police have confirmed they have received a referral.

The deputy director of gynaecology at Mater Mother's Hospital, Elize Bolton, said she saw between three and five patients a year who had undergone the procedure, which is also known as female circumcision, at the anti-natal clinic the hospital runs for refugees.

During the procedure, females, often just girls, have their external genitalia removed, most often without anaesthesia.

Depending on how far the person performing it goes, the clitoris, urethra, labia minora and labia majora can be cut off, with tools ranging from knives to anything sharp, such as a tin lid. The area is then stitched, leaving a small vaginal opening for the woman to menstruate and urinate.

Complications include bleeding, infection, difficulty passing urine and pain during sexual intercourse. Depending on the level of scar tissue, child birth can be an issue.

Dr Bolton said in many cases, the woman's vagina had to be cut open in order for her to give birth.

""It is horrible for us because we are not used to it – but in Africa you do what the community does, because if you don't you get thrown out – so a mother may take a daughter, because even if it was traumatic for her, if she doesn't do it, she will be thrown out,"" she said.

""And we think why would a mother would do that to her daughter, but we don't have to fight day to day for our living. And if she didn't, she would be thrown out of her community. And being thrown out to live on your own in Africa...that doesn't bear thinking about.

""...I am from Africa, so I know a little bit more about it than the average person.

""And it is hard to understand why people would take their daughters to Africa to have it done when they live in Australia, but their culture can be so ingrained into them, they just do it. It is cultural and that can be very difficult to shake off. It doesn't make it right, but it is hard to change.""

Dr Bolton said she did know of cases of where women themselves had asked for the procedure to be done, but often, it was a traumatic experience.

In some areas, the woman's legs are bound together after the procedure for up to a week, in order to stop the bleeding.

Country ‘most risky for media’ BRUSSELS



The International Federation of Journalists has termed Pakistan the most dangerous country for media, with 14 journalists killed in the country in 2014 alone.



The overall number of journalists who died in targeted killings, bomb attacks or shootings around the world rose to 118 in 2014 from 105 the year before, International Federation of Journalists said.



Another 17 died in accidents or natural disasters while on assignment, according to the Brussels-based organisation.



Pakistan was followed by Syria, where 12 journalists were killed. Nine killings each occurred in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories. Eight journalists each were killed in Iraq and Ukraine.



The International Federation of Journalists said its figures were a reminder of the growing threats to journalists, and it called on governments to make protecting members of the media a priority.



“It is time for action in the face of unprecedented threats to journalists who are targeted not only to restrict the free flow of information, but increasingly as leverage to secure huge ransoms and political concessions through sheer violence,” Federation president Jim Boumelha said.



“As a result, some media organisations are weary of sending reporters to war zones out of fear for their safety,” Jim added.

715|California snow survey shows higher snowpack|"ECHO SUMMIT, Calif. (AP) - The winter’s first survey of the Sierra Nevada snowpack found more snow than last year at this time, but officials said much more is needed to end the California drought.

The Department of Water Resources conducted the survey Tuesday at an elevation of about 6,800 feet some 90 miles east of Sacramento.

Frank Gehrke, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program, said there were 21.3 inches of snow on the ground after recent heavy storms.

It was more snow than this time last year, but the water content was still far below average for the date.

California’s snowpack supplies about a third of the water needed by state residents, agriculture and industry as it melts in the late spring and summer.

“California needs much more rain and snow than we’ve experienced over the past two years to end the drought in 2015,” said department Director Mark Cowin. “The department encourages Californians to continue their water conservation practices.”

Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency Jan. 17.

After three years of drought, most storms that drenched the state this month have been powerful but relatively warm, delivering above-average rainfall to most of the state while providing a modest early winter snowpack.

The water content of the snow measured Tuesday was about 33 percent of average.

Statewide, 105 electronic sensors in the Sierra detected a water content of about 50 percent of the multi-year average for the day. That compares favorably with last winter’s first survey, when the snowpack water content statewide was only 20 percent of normal, which tied with 2012 as the driest readings on record.

Tuesday’s readings indicate that water content in the northern mountains is 20 percent of the average on April 1, when it normally peaks before the spring melt.

The Department of Water Resources and other agencies conduct manual snow surveys around the first of the month between January and May to check the accuracy of real-time electronic readings.

More snow is good news for those heading to the mountains to celebrate the arrival of 2015.

“Skiers have certainly enjoyed the early season snow storms, and cold temperatures have offered ideal conditions for snowmaking,” said Rachael Woods, a spokeswoman for Northstar California Resort. “We’ll ring in the New Year with fresh snow on the slopes.”

The company operates the Heavenly, Northstar and Kirkwood facilities in the state."

Police have seized an illegal handgun during a dramatic raid at an inner-west house targeted in a drive-by shooting last month.

Heavily armed police surrounded the house in Roslyn Street, Ashbury, on Wednesday afternoon to search for illegal firearms.

A police spokesman said Gangs Squad detectives were conducting a Firearms Prohibition Order search with the assistance of the Tactical Operations Unit.

More than 200 people in NSW are subjected to Firearms Prohibition Orders which ban the acquisition, possession or use of a firearm or ammunition.

Those issued with a ban are predominately gang members and organised crime figures, police have previously said.

By Wednesday evening, officers had seized a handgun but continued to search the property.

Roslyn Street remained closed at 6.30pm, and several helicopters were hovering overhead.

Officers could be seen talking to occupants at the front of the one-storey brick home while a heavily armed tactical response team guarded the scene.

Residents said the same home was targeted in a drive-by shooting in the middle of the night last month.

Several shots were fired at the house at 3.10am on November 25.

Police believed the shooting may have been linked to another shooting the previous night in Monterrey, in southern Sydney.

In that shooting, two shots were fired into the rear of a house on O'Connell Street at 9.40pm."

719|Speculation rife, eyebrows raised in ISRO succession|"Geologist Shailesh Nayak was named chairman, selected ad hoc, ahead of senior space scientists like M Y S Prasad and Kiran Kumar







Atime-honoured tradition in the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) was broken on Wednesday. Dr K Radhakrishnan retired as chairman of the Bengaluru-headquarteredorganisation without naming a successor, making tongues wag in the science and bureaucratic circles. He was apparently under instructions from the Centre to refrain from exercising the privilege of handing over the baton.



Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reported to be keen on having a 'trusted' man to head the space organisation . So at the fag end of Wednesday, Dr ShaileshNayak , secretary in the ministry of earth sciences who joined ISRO in 1978 as geologist, has been named as acting chairman, also a first in the organisation's 45-year history.



The only other time an ad hoc chairman was appointed was when Dr VikramSarabhai died in office on December 30, 1971; that of course was an exigent situation. Prof MGK Menon was appointed to the post ad hoc until Satish Dhawan took over in September 1972. Speculations suggest that the Modi government is buying time and may even go with Nayak as permanent chairman after his one-month 'interim' tenure comes to an end.

One way or the other, there is much concern over the developments in ISRO. ISRO scientists who Bangalore Mirror spoke to also expressed worries over a geologist being named as chairman, although ad hoc, but with full-fledged role subsequently. All the ISRO chairmen so far have been from the fields of physics, aerospace engineering, space sciences and research, satellite technology or astronomy.

In fact, questions are being raised over why Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) director MYS Prasad or ISRO's Space Application Centre (SAC) director Kiran Kumar were not named well in advance, both having served meritoriously over the years, besides being actively involved in several recent missions that have won ISRO and India many accolades from the world over. Modi is said to be not impressed with either.

Interestingly, Prof UR Rao, former Isro chairman and ex-space commission member, had been given the charge of a committee to search for Radhakrishnan's successor. Prof Rao is understood to have pushed for the names of both these senior space scientists, but the shocker came on Wednesday when, in the absence of any successor being named in advance, 2009 Bhaskar awardee Dr Nayak's name cropped up late in the day that Radhakrishnan retired.

Prof Rao confirmed to Bangalore Mirror that this was the first time that an ISRO chairman's successor was not named in advance.

SURPRISED!



Radhakrishnan was felicitated by chief minister Siddaramaiah at a function organised by the Bangalore Press Club. At the event, Siddaramaiah was surprised to learn that he was felicitating Radhakrishnan on the day he was retiring. When the chief minister asked him for confirmation, Radhakrishnan plainly said: ""Yes, I have just arrived after signing the last few papers.""





HIGHS & LOWS

Radhakrishnan took over as ISRO chairman in October 2009. But his initial leadership was marred by two back-to-back failures of the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicles in 2010 April and December. However, the success achieved in the Mars mission in September 2014 and the December 2014 successful test flight of GSLV Mark III that proved ISRO's capability to launch 4 tonne satellites proved to be the high points of his leadership.

721|Stanbic IBTC Deepens ETF, Lists 11.45m Units|"A wholly owned subsidiary of Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, Stanbic IBTC Asset Management Limited, has listed 11.447 million units of Stanbic IBTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) 30.

The company, on September 15, 2014, issued an initial public offering (IPO) for the Stanbic IBTC ETF 30 with 10 million units of the fund at N100 each at par with a minimum subscription of 10,000 units and in multiples of 5,000 units thereafter.

The offer was oversubscribed to and fully allotted, representing 114.47 per cent of the entire offer.

The chief executive officer (CEO), Stanbic IBTC Asset Management, managers of the fund, Olumide Oyetan, said, “In line with the growing ETF industry, Stanbic IBTC developed the Stanbic ETF 30 to give investors optimal exposure to the Nigerian bourse by tracking the movement of the NSE 30 index. This is the first ETF for Stanbic IBTC and we are coming with many more that will track different underline before the end of June, 2015.”

He said that the offer was 14 per cent over subscribed to and disclosed that a few clients have promised that once it is listed, they would invest more in the ETF. He emphasised that Stanbic IBTC Asset management is at the fore front of promoting the ETF and creating awareness on the products.

“The opening of the Stanbic IBTC ETF 30 is a direct response to increased investor demand for passive investment strategies that will deliver the market return for the index being tracked, which in this case is the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) 30 of the NSE.

“Our ETF is merely providing a transparent and flexible structure that allows investors to efficiently gain exposure to the securities of these companies that have over time out-performed the broad equity market,” he said.

Oyetan added that ETFs are essentially index funds that are listed and traded on the exchange like shares.

Buying and selling ETFs is as simple as buying and selling of shares.

He explained, “Unlike shares and mutual funds however, the ETFs will trade continuously all day long and allow investors to lock in a price for the underlying stocks immediately, rather than being bought and sold based on end-of-day prices.”"

723|Al-Jazeera journalists jailed in Egypt could be freed|"LONDON -- Three Al Jazeera journalists jailed in Egypt for the past year are looking forward to a court hearing on Thursday. The men were convicted of supporting the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and of spreading false news, but from the start, the case has been more about politics than crime.

Now, however, CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer reports the political winds in Egypt are shifting, and there's hope that the next court date could see the trio set free.

Al Jazeera correspondent Peter Greste, producer Baher Mohamed and Cairo bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy - and the men's families, have been living a nightmare.

""We just hope so much that everything sorts itself out on the 1st of January,"" Lois Greste, the correspondent's mother, said recently. She and her husband are hoping an appeal judge will rule on New Year's day that their son is free to leave Egypt and fly home.

To keep the pressure up, Al Jazeera staff held a vigil at the network's headquarters in Doha, Qatar this week, while in London, friends and colleagues demonstrated outside the Egyptian Embassy.

Supporters have tweeted their solidarity for months with the hashtag #FreeAJStaff.

Journalism is Not a Crime. #FreeAJStaff. Watch our @ajam special. Peter,Mohamed,Baher have been in jail for 1 year pic.twitter.com/Jh5tgS0CgJ — Nick Schifrin (@nickschifrin) December 29, 2014

The three men were arrested last December in their hotel room in Cairo - where they'd been covering the story of Egypt's military seizing power from the elected president, Mohammed Morsi. But the government accused them of acting as a mouthpiece for a banned hardline Islamic party, the Muslim Brotherhood, which backed Morsi.

In fact, most diplomats believe the men are guilty of nothing more than working for a TV network funded by the Arab kingdom of Qatar, Egypt's bitter enemy.

""Mohamed is a pawn in a cold war between Egypt and Qatar,"" said Marwa Omara, Fahmy's fiancé. ""He didn't do anything, he didn't commit any crime."" In June, the men were convicted in a trial that was farcical and chaotic.

President Obama has joined the chorus of international calls for their freedom, saying his administration has ""been clear both publicly and privately, they should be released.""

Palmer says there is now some reason for optimism; relations between Egypt and Qatar have recently thawed, and Al Jazeera has made a concession and shut down its Egyptian affiliate.

""I'd like to think that it's removed the political aspect of the reason why Peter was arrested,"" said Michael Greste, the Al Jazeera newsman's brother, ""which is another reason why we'd like to be a bit hopeful that we might have a just outcome on the first (of January).""

As Palmer notes, however, Egyptian courts are notoriously unpredictable -- sometimes verdicts are delivered in a matter of minutes while in other cases, the parties involved are left waiting days to learn the outcome."
724|Suicide blast kills 20 Al Houthis in north Yemen|"Sana’a: Tension intensified in Yemen on Wednesday when Al Qaida-linked suicide bomber blew himself up inside a gathering of Al Houthis in the northern province of Ibb, killing at least 20 people and injuring dozens as analysts warned that the country is teetering on the brink of a wider sectarian warfare.

Witnesses told Gulf News that a young man dressed like an Al Houthi infiltrated into a ceremony to celebrate the birthday of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) in Ibb city. Yazzer Abbad, a local journalist who survived the attack, said the Gulf News that the suicide bomber waited until the middle of the ceremony to set off his explosive belt.

“It was a bloody day. I saw the police carrying the bodies of 18 people from inside the building. There were nearly 250 people inside the hall.”

Abbad said that the security measures were high prior to the ceremony as both the Al Houthis and security services deployed many armed vehicles and men outside Cultural Centre hall in Ibb city. “ The police and the Al Houthis only checked the journalists and left many people to enter unchecked,”

The governor of Ibb, Yahyia Al Arayani, and many senior local officials who were sitting in the first rows survived with injuries, according to the witnesses. Abbad said that among the dead were some primary and secondary students who attended the ceremony.

Unlike many provinces that were impacted by the spiralling violence since the beginning of anti-regime protests in early 2011, the province of Ibb has long enjoyed peace and security until Al Houthis gained control of the capital in September. As they were expanding their influence into new territories in northern Yemen, Al Qaida militants battled them into some parts of Ibb and announced in October the capture of the district of Oudian. Al Houthis are now fully in control of the province of Ibb.

Analysts in Yemen have warned that the country is poised to be another Syria or Iraq with the increasing suicide bombings that target Al Houthi gatherings.

Jamar Amer, the editor of Al Wasat newspaper, told Gulf News that Al Qaida-orchestrated suicide attacks have expanded into new areas.

“This is a very dangerous development. Al Qaida’s suicide attacks have never reached Ibb province. The militants want to send a message that they are there in Ibb.”

Amer said that the expansion of attacks in the future depends on Al Houthis’ ability to secure their areas. Al Houthis have recently called upon Yemenis to openly celebrate the birthday of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) across the country.

Amer predicted bloodier attacks on Al Houthis celebratory gatherings. “The Salafis see these celebrations as a deviation from Islam.”

In the south, unidentified men shot a dead a security official in the province of Shabwa, local sources said. Witnesses said a group of armed men inside a car approached security officer Mohammad Ahmad Al Nasi and killed him inside his car. The attackers fled the scene to an unknown destination. Hundreds of similar drive-by shootings killed hundreds of security personal across the country in the last four years. The government blames Al Qaida’s active branch in Yemen for the attacks."
725|Another UN Failure|"The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Tuesday rejected a Jordan sponsored Palestinian resolution calling for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and the establishment of a Palestinian state by 2018. The resolution needed 9 votes in favour, but it managed to receive only 8, while there were five abstentions. Even if it had got one more vote, it would still have failed, since the US had, not surprisingly, already vetoed the resolution. The rejection of even this, much watered-down, resolution further reiterates the glaring limitations of the UN and makes sure its most high-profile failure continues to blight its facade. An interest oriented, real-politick stance was always expected from the US – the UN was designed to counterbalance exactly this self-serving tendency of nations – so criticizing states, as we have done vociferously in the past, is a futile exercise. The decades of injustice perpetrated in Gaza and the West Bank seem to be finally morally compelling European states to change their policies; despite this the US still has its finger on the jugular and it is unwilling to budge.

The world’s attention must be drawn to the body itself, which, despite grand premises and lofty ideas, is ineffective where it matters the most. The UN has done brilliant work codifying an extensive catalogue of human rights and continues to monitor, mediate and rebuild in many conflict-struck areas. Yet, these are ancillary objectives; the UN has failed in fulfilling its main objective of preventing conflict and mitigating warfare. For many, the cause of this lies in the structure of the UN itself; the veto leads to deadlock whenever the veto powers feel their interests are threatened. The only times the UN has played an effective part, in Libya and Yugoslavia, is when global interests coincidently aligned. What is the use of a multi-lateral body that relies on coincidence to function? The old justification of the veto – since the five nations are global powers, any action not in accordance with their wishes would lead to global conflict – has become untenable now that we see it propagating conflict instead. It is time for a reassessment of the UN."

728|‘Welcome refugees and reject racism’|"BERLIN: Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to turn their backs on a growing grass-roots movement of anti-Muslim protesters, calling them racists full of hatred, and said Europe’s biggest economy must welcome people fleeing conflict and war.

In an unusually strongly worded New Year address that also condemned Russia for its actions in Ukraine, Merkel said it was essential for Germany to help the children of persecuted people to grow up without fear. Many Germans are worried about a flood of asylum seekers, many from Syria, pouring into the country. A new movement, Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA), is holding weekly rallies in the eastern city of Dresden.

Referring to protests that took place before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Merkel said, “Today many people are again shouting on Mondays: ‘We are the people’. But in fact they mean: You do not belong - because of the colour of your skin or your religion.

“So I say to everyone who goes to such demonstrations: Do not follow those who are appealing to you! Because too often there is prejudice, coldness, even hatred, in their hearts.”

Partly in response to its Nazi past, German asylum rules are among the most liberal in the world. Asylum granted elsewhere had helped many opponents of the Nazi regime to survive."

730|Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast,... -- DUBLIN, Dec. 30, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --|"DUBLIN, Dec. 30, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/lpx2w9/wound_dressings) has announced the addition of the ""Wound Dressings Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2014 - 2020"" report to their offering.

http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130307/600769



Traditional wound care practices have been followed since the earliest of human civilizations. These practices were not complete, as these did not provide adequate condition for the growth of new skin cells. It was recently discovered by modern science that moisture and proper aeration is necessary for adequate growth of underlying epidermal or endoderm cells. This not only helped the wound heal faster, but also decreased discomfort to a large extent.



Currently, consumers of wound care products are not limited to trauma patients or household accidental cases, but include the diabetic geriatric populations with ulcerative complications. Skin ulcer and tissue necrosis are leading global concerns among the rural and diabetic population with inadequate access to medical care. This major driver led to innovations in wound care technology, which is presently provided by advanced wound management products across the world.



The wound dressings market has been categorized based on types of products and geography. The product segment has been further sub-segmented into traditional wound dressings and advanced wound dressings. The traditional wound dressings segment includes wound closure products (gauze tapes, sponges, surgical cotton swabs and others), basic wound care products, and anti-infective dressings. The advanced wound dressings segment includes emerging and advanced wound dressings such as films, foams dressings, hydrofiber, hydrocolloids, hydrogels, collagen and alginates. Foams is the leading sub-segment of the advanced wound dressings segment in terms of revenue.



This is because foams are versatile, in terms of applicability and healing, and are readily available in stores. Foams also witnessed the fastest growth due to faster healing and advances within the basic design, thereby offering wide range of wound coverage. Films, collagen, hydrogels and alginates would witness slow growth during the forecast period. Products such as hydrocolloids and hydrofiber would demonstrate impressive growth potential and are expected to continue growing in the near future with increasing prevalence of trauma wounds, burns, injuries, chronic medical conditions such as AIDS, cancer, diabetes and other skin ulcerative diseases.

731|Kim Jong-un may visit China in 2015: Ta Kung Pao｜WCT|"Kim Jong-un inspects a manufacturer of children's food in Pyongyang, Dec. 16. (Photo/Xinhua)

North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un has made no overseas trips since he took power upon the death of his father Kim Jong-il three years ago, but media and analysts believe Kim is likely to visit China in 2015 barring unexpected incident, Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao reports.

Some South Korean scholars have noted however a cooling in the longstanding alliance between the two countries, with China becoming more outspoken in opposition to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, while Beijing has also rejected Pyongyang's requests for aid in military modernization and economic development.

Qiu Guohong, China's ambassador to South Korea, said in September however that Kim might visit Beijing at an unspecified date, saying mutual visits by the top leaders of the two countries are normal as the two have maintained normal relations.

Qiu had said in April that mutual visits between the top leaders of China and North Korea must take into account the atmosphere of the international community in addition to political considerations. Qiu's remarks in September may thus be a signal of an olive branch.

North Korea's nuclear program remains a major bone of contention. Pyongyang insists it will not relinquish nuclear weapons as long as the US sees it as an enemy.

There is meanwhile plausible media speculation that Kim could visit Russia in May 2015 to break the nation's diplomatic isolation. Xi Jinping of China visited South Korea last year after becoming China's president in a break with previous tradition whereby a visit by an incoming Chinese leader was first paid to the North, a move which is understood to have displeased Kim, who might choose to visit Russia first to reflect this."
732|AirAsia crash: bad weather hinders attempts to investigate suspected wreck|"Divers looking for the wreck of the crashed AirAsia Indonesia jet off Borneo were unable to resume full-scale operations on Thursday in poor weather and heavy seas.

Rescue teams now fear it could take a week to find the black box flight recorders and establish exactly what went caused the Airbus A320-200 jet carrying 162 passangers and crew to crash.

Crews were on standby to descend to a large object detected by sonar on the ocean floor, lying just 30-50 metres (100-165 feet) deep. Rescuers believe it is the plane, which disappeared on Sunday en route from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore.

“I am hoping that the latest information is correct and aircraft has been found,” airline boss Tony Fernandes tweeted on Thursday. “Please all hope together. This is so important.”

Toos Sanitiyoso, an air safety investigator with the National Committee for Transportation Safety, said he hoped the black box flight data and voice recorders could be found within a week, suggesting there was still doubt over the plane’s location.

“The main thing is to find the main area of the wreckage and then the black box,” he told reporters. None of the tell-tale black box “pings” had been detected, he said.

A break in bad weather on Thursday morning raised hopes that divers would be able to investigate the object, but frogman commander Lieutenant Edi Tirkayasa said the weather had worsened and was making it difficult for even professional rescue divers.

“What is most difficult is finding the location where the plane fell – checking whether the aircraft is really there,” he told Reuters.

“This is very difficult even with sophisticated equipment. With weather like this, who knows. We are still hopeful and optimistic that they’ll find it. They must.”



Investigators are working on a theory that the plane stalled as it climbed steeply to avoid a storm about 40 minutes into the flight.

So far, at least eight bodies have been recovered from the Java Sea. They have been taken in numbered coffins to Surabaya, where relatives of the victims have gathered, for identification. Authorities have been collecting DNA from the relatives to help identify the bodies.

Some of the bodies recovered so far have been fully clothed, including a flight attendant still wearing her AirAsia uniform. That could indicate the Airbus was intact when it hit the water and also support the aerodynamic stall theory.

Most of the 162 people on board were Indonesians. No survivors have been found.

Strong wind and waves hampered the search, and with visibility at less than a kilometre (half a mile), the air operation was called off on Wednesday afternoon.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo said his priority was retrieving the bodies.

Relatives, many of whom collapsed in grief when they saw the first grim television pictures confirming their fears on Tuesday, held prayers at a crisis centre at Surabaya airport.

The plane was travelling at 32,000 feet (9,753 metres) and had asked to fly at 38,000 feet to avoid bad weather. When air traffic controllers granted permission for a rise to 34,000 feet a few minutes later, they received no response.

A source close to the probe into what happened said radar data appeared to show that the aircraft made an “unbelievably” steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the Airbus A320’s limits.

“So far, the numbers taken by the radar are unbelievably high. This rate of climb is very high, too high. It appears to be beyond the performance envelope of the aircraft,” he said.

The source, who declined to be named, added that more information was needed to come to a firm conclusion.

Online discussion among pilots has centred on unconfirmed secondary radar data from Malaysia that suggested the aircraft was climbing at a speed of 353 knots, about 100 knots too slow, and that it might have stalled.

The Indonesian captain, a former air force fighter pilot, had 6,100 flying hours under his belt and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, according to the airline, which is 49 percent owned by Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia.

Three airline disasters involving Malaysian-affiliated carriers in less than a year have dented confidence in the country’s aviation industry and spooked travellers.

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing in March on a trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew and has not been found. On July 17, the same airline’s Flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.

On board Flight QZ8501 were 155 Indonesians, three South Koreans, and one person each from Singapore, Malaysia and Britain. The co-pilot was French.

The AirAsia group, including affiliates in Thailand, the Philippines and India, had not suffered a crash since its Malaysian budget operations began in 2002."

The embassy tweeted on Tuesday that the Dominican government respected its right to perform the ceremony under the Vienna Convention and that the British government has recognized the marriage.

Embassy officials said they have advised the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that additional ceremonies would be performed.

The couple was not identified, with the embassy saying only that it is a Dominican and a British man. Embassy officials tweeted a picture of the ceremony that showed only the hands of one man placing a wedding ring on the other.

The United Kingdom announced in June that same-sex couple could marry at British consulates in 25 countries, including the Dominican Republic. It is the only Caribbean country on that list.

The U.K. parliament approved same-sex marriages in July 2013, and the law went into effect in England and Wales in March of this year.

The Palestinian draft resolution ""can never be a unilateral step either by the Palestinians or by the Arabs. It is a legal right for the Palestinian people to establish their state,"" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Xinhua.



""The Palestinian leadership is urged to immediately launch alternative steps in the light of what happened in the UN Security Council,"" Erekat said.



The Arab-backed draft resolution, presented by Jordan Tuesday, failed to gain the minimum nine votes in favour needed for adoption from the 15 state members of the UN Security Council.



The US and Australia voted against it.



Even if it had gained the nine votes needed for adoption, the US, one of the five permanent members of the council, would have vetoed it.

736|Welcome refugees and reject racism, Merkel says after rallies|"Update: 11:33, 31 December 2014 Wednesday

Welcome refugees and reject racism, Merkel says after rallies

World Bulletin/News Desk

Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to turn their backs on a growing far-right movement of anti-Muslim protesters, calling them racists full of hatred, and said Europe's biggest economy must welcome people fleeing conflict and war.

In an unusually strongly worded New Year address that also condemned Russia for its actions in Ukraine, Merkel said it was essential for Germany to help the children of persecuted people to grow up without fear.

Many Germans are complaining of asylum seekers, many from Syria, pouring into the country. A new movement, Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA), is holding weekly rallies in the eastern city of Dresden.

Referring to protests that took place before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Merkel said, ""Today many people are again shouting on Mondays: 'We are the people'. But in fact they mean: You do not belong - because of the colour of your skin or your religion.

""So I say to everyone who goes to such demonstrations: Do not follow those who are appealing to you! Because too often there is prejudice, coldness, even hatred, in their hearts.""

Partly in response to its Nazi past, German asylum rules are among the most liberal in the world. Asylum granted elsewhere had helped many opponents of the Nazi regime to survive.

The number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany has surged to about 200,000 this year, four times the numbers in 2012. Net immigration has hit a two-decade high.

Consequently, immigration has moved up on the political agenda. Some members of Merkel's conservative bloc worry that they risk losing support if they do not respond to voter fears.

Growing support for PEGIDA's marches - a week ago more than 17,000 attended - and the popularity of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party since it shifted its focus from euro-scepticism to immigration is causing shockwaves in Berlin.

Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, also reiterated that Russia had questioned the foundation of Europe's peaceful order - self-determination - with its actions in Ukraine. She said Europe would not allow Russia to abuse human rights."
737|The Wall Street Journal: France to start crackdown on ‘Uberpop-type’ services|"The sale of marijuana for recreational use began in Oregon on Thursday as it joined Washington state and Colorado in allowing the sale of a drug that remains illegal under U.S. federal law.

Oregon residents 21 years and older can buy up to seven grams (a quarter-ounce) of dried flowers at roughly 200 existing medical-use marijuana dispensaries as a new law took effect that backers hope will help curb a flourishing black market.

""You can get all the best strains from Oregon, which can make this into a top tourist spot,"" said Sue Vorenberg, a former cannabis industry worker and editor of the Cannabis Daily Record.

Voters in Oregon and Alaska last year approved marijuana use and possession in state-regulated frameworks. Retail pot shops, like those already operating in Washington state and Colorado, are expected to start in 2016. The District of Columbia has also legalized marijuana possession.

While marijuana use remains illegal for any reason under federal law, 23 states allow cannabis use for medical purposes.

Legalization measures will be on the ballot in Ohio in November and in other states in 2016.

In Oregon, possessing and growing pot became legal in July.

Come January, the state expects to start accepting applications for retail businesses. Through 2015, recreational-use pot sales will be untaxed, though that will likely change next year.

Legalization measures have drawn opposition from anti-marijuana groups who say they heighten drug use and access by children.

Roughly 30 municipalities in Oregon have enacted bans, while others have sharply limited the nascent industry.

In Portland, the state's largest city, lawmakers on Wednesday were considering limits on the number of stores allowed in each neighborhood and operating hours.

""We've lost the war on marijuana,"" Klamath County Commissioner Jim Bellet said last month as he voted to support the county's cannabis ban.

Vorenberg said people have been traveling from Oregon to neighboring Washington state to buy marijuana and could continue to do so in search of lower prices."

741|Russian Opposition Leader Detained for Trying to Join Protest|"Russian Opposition Leader Detained for Trying to Join Protest

VoA - News Thursday 1st January, 2015

MOSCOW - Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been detained after trying to join his supporters in central Moscow Tuesday protesting his sentencing on fraud charges earlier in the day.

The court gave the lawyer and blogger a suspended sentence for embezzlement but ordered his brother Oleg Navalny, who also was on trial, to serve three-and-a-half years in prison.

Political analysts said the court's action demonstrates the Kremlin's fear of leaders who can mobilize public opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Hundreds of Alexei Navalny's supporters protested near the Kremlin Tuesday night, demanding that the opposition leader and his brother Oleg be set free.

Police, out in full force, detained Alexei Navalny as he tried to join the rally, in violation of his house arrest.

Earlier in the day, Alexei Navalny called for sustained street protests after he and his brother were sentenced.

""This power does not deserve to exist, it should be destroyed. I am calling today on everybody to take to the streets, I'm calling to take to the streets until the power which tortures innocent people is removed,"" Alexei Navalny said.

In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke called the guilty verdict ""disturbing.""

""The decision is a disturbing development in our view, and it appears to be designed to further punish and deter political activism. This appears to be another example of the Russian government's growing crackdown on independent voices,"" Rathke said.

Jeff Mankoff, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the targeting of high-profile activists sends a message to the Russian public that they, too, are vulnerable and the law will not protect them.

""So even though you haven't had the widespread visible opposition you had, say, in late 2011, and even though Putin's approval ratings are around 80 percent, I think the careful handling of this case indicates the fact that the political leadership is still worried that somewhere below the surface that opposition sentiment continues to bubble,"" Mankoff said.

A surge in nationalism this year following Russia's annexation of Crimea distracted the public's attention from the corruption issues championed by Alexei Navalny. He led protests in 2011 and 2012 against Putin that were the largest shows of public opposition since the Russian leader came to power.

The court's decision to jail Navalny's brother, Oleg, but not him is a sign that the Kremlin fears making the opposition leader into a martyr, said Russian political analyst Nikolai Petrov.

""They are very afraid of making Navalny a hero who is staying behind bars and who can serve as informal leader for all opposition movements, for protests and so on,"" Petrov said.

""And, I think that when making this final decision about a pretty soft sentence, the Kremlin took into consideration, well, a worsening economic situation and the possibility of large-scale social protest and, well, this movement in social networks,"" he added.

Over 33,000 Navalny supporters signed up to protest the verdict on January 15, but the court on Monday abruptly moved up the date by two weeks.

At the hastily arranged evening rally, a much smaller group of Navalny supporters chanted for freedom in Russia and denounced Putin.

The turnout was pretty good considering the timing - just a day before New Year's Eve and with freezing temperatures, said protester Mikhail.

""Of course they wanted to weaken the reaction, because on the 15th more people would have turned out. But I think they will still come on the 15th,"" Mikhail said.

Some scuffles broke out as supporters of Putin clashed with the protesters. A number of people were arrested as busloads of riot police moved in after a couple of hours to clear the square of any signs of public opposition."

743|UPDATE 1-Ebola spreads in Sierra Leone as global cases top 20,000 - WHO|"(Adds details)

GENEVA Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Ebola virus is still spreading in West Africa, especially in Sierra Leone, and the number of known cases globally has now exceeded 20,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.

The death toll from the outbreak, which has been mostly confined to West Africa, has risen to 7,905, the WHO said, following 317 fatalities recorded since it last issued figures on Dec. 24.

The number of known cases, including fatalities, totalled 20,206 at year-end, it said.

Sierra Leone accounted for 337 of 476 new laboratory-confirmed cases since Dec. 24. They included 149 in Freetown, the highest incidence in the capital in four weeks.

The urgent need for assistance in Sierra Leone prompted the United States Agency for International Development to airlift two ambulances to Freetown from Liberia's capital Monrovia, once the worst Ebola hotspot, the United Nations said.

However, the number of cases in Sierra Leone over a three-week period has fallen below 1,000 for the first time since Sept. 28, suggesting the spread of the disease is slowing. In neighbouring Guinea, the three-week total rose for a second week to 346, suggesting the epidemic is growing there.

Nine countries have now reported cases of Ebola. In Britain, a nurse was diagnosed with the virus this week upon her return from Sierra Leone. She is being treated with blood plasma from a survivor of the virus and an experimental antiviral drug, the London hospital treating her said on Wednesday"

She told Cosmopolitan’s Body magazine that the cold weather had changed her appetite.

Nicole, who is in a relationship with Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton, said: “When I finish work it can be really hard to eat healthily – when it’s cold you just want to eat a melted-cheese panini and soup.

“I’m going to turn into a cup of tea and a curry by the time I leave London! I eat differently in the UK from when I’m in LA.

“Over there, I’m happy eating a kale salad and sushi rolls but with this weather I’ve been eating a lot of curry. I do miss the sun in LA, but London inspires me in a different way. It’s like being in a movie.”

Nicole, who used to suffer from bulimia, credited exercise with giving her a positive outlook.

“[Exercise] changes everything about how I approach my day and helps me go about life with confidence – that’s the main reason I do it,” she said.

“It gives me clarity and makes me feel stronger. It’s not so much for the physical and vanity side of it. I do it more for the emotional and mental strength it gives me.”"
746|Pakistan ‘most dangerous country for media’ in 2014|"BRUSSELS - One hundred and eighteen journalists and media staff were killed around the world in 2014, with Pakistan and Syria the deadliest countries, the International Federation of Journalists said Wednesday.

The IFJ said those killed, 13 more than in 2013, were either targeted for their work or caught in the cross-fire while another 17 died in accidents or natural disasters while on assignment.

It renewed its call to governments to ""make the protection of journalists their priority"".

Journalists are ""targeted not only to restrict the free flow of information, but increasingly as leverage to secure huge ransoms and political concessions through sheer violence,"" IFJ president Jim Boumelha said in a statement.

He said some media organisations are now wary of sending reporters to war zones or even using material from freelancers there, warning that war coverage will ""be poorer for lack of independent witnesses"" unless media safety is improved.

Pakistan was the deadliest country with 14 journalists killed, followed by 12 dead in Syria and nine each in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories.

Among those killed this year was AFP journalist Sardar Ahmad, 40, who was shot dead in March when Taliban militants stormed a hotel in the Afghan capital Kabul. He died along with his wife and two of his three children.

Eight journalists each were killed in Iraq and Ukraine while six died in Honduras and five in Mexico.

IFJ said the public beheadings of journalists, including US freelancers James Foley and Steven Sotloff, by the Islamic State militant group were a ""game changer in the governments' attitude to media projection.""

The IFJ figures, which include presenters and other staff such as drivers working for the media, are sharply higher than those given by the Committee to Protect Journalists which said a week ago that 60 journalists were killed this year.

Another watchdog, Reporters Without Borders, reported on December 16 that 66 reporters had died in 2014.

In Pakistan, like the previous years, 2014 remained tough for the journalists as more than a dozen of them lost life in different terror related and sponsored violence while scores other received threat calls and intimidation letters.

Media houses were attacked and the media persons performing field duty thrashed by the police and the political activists. Despite the fact media in Pakistan faced intense situation some media groups showed schism while other posed neutrality.

The first casualty of the journalist took place in Larkana where Shan Dahar fell victim to a terror attack. In Sindh, Jewan Arian was another terror victim from Khairpur. In Punjab, Yaqub Shahzad from Hafizabad and Mian Nadeem Haider from Mianwali died in violence. Irshad Mastung and Ghulam Rasool were killed in their office in Quetta, Balochistan, while another Afzal Khwaja in Jaffarabad in what is dominantly believed to be a terror-related incident.

The murder of the 14 media persons raised the countrywide death toll of journalists to over 100 during the last decade. Except in two cases, the culprits have been traced out while the families of the victim journalists are continuing to live in deep miseries.

Senior anchorperson of a private TV channel Hamid Mir faced life attempt in Karachi. Mir blamed a secret agency of the country for the attack which led to a propaganda war between the state elements and the media organistion he is working for. Another anchorman of a TV channel, Raza Rumi, narrowly escaped a bid on his life in which his driver was killed.

In addition to it, four workers associated with a private TV channel were gunned down in North Nazimabad Karachi when they were sitting in their DSNG. A bomb was hurled at the residence of Jamshed Baguwan, Bureau Chief of the same channel, in Peshawar. Zafar Aheer, resident Editor of an Urdu daily was kidnapped and subjected to torture."

748|Hindus to Free India of Christians and Muslims by 2021|"By Joseph DeCaro, Worthy News Correspondent

NEW DELHI (Worthy News)-- A group dedicated to the Hindu principles of ""cosmic law"" has declared that India will become a Hindu rashtra (dominion) by 2021, according to The Daily Mail (India).

The Dharma Jagran Samiti group has been promoting programs designed to reconvert Hindus who have left for other religions.

""Muslims and Christians don't have any right to stay here,"" said Rajeshwar Singh, leader of the Uttar Pradesh chapter of the DJS. ""So they would either be converted to Hinduism, or forced to run away from here.""

Singh said that although he had temporarily suspended the ""ghar wapsi"" or reconversion programs that were planned for December 25, they would soon be restarted.

""I will ensure that India is freed of Muslims and Christians by December 31, 2021,"" Singh said.

Singh said he wouldn't let Muslims and Christians convert the Hindus.

""The enemies have tried many a time in the past to finish Hinduism. But every time, Ram, Krishna and Chanakya came forward to finish them and restore the glory of Hinduism.

""I am also doing the same.""

Drunk driving crackdowns are planned in various parts of Wisconsin Wednesday night, as well as into the New Year.

A task force of over 230 officers in Milwaukee and Waukesha counties has been targeting OWI offenders since October -- and they've made 69 arrests while giving out 730 citations.

The task force is made up of state troopers, county sheriff's deputies, and municipal police. They plan to hold a roll call ceremony at 4 p.m. in front of the Waukesha Fire Department to kick off their night of enforcement.

Numerous communities will offer safe rides home to revelers who've had one too many. The Tavern League of Wisconsin's Web site has a list of establishments offering rides home.

Miller Brewing is providing free bus rides in a number of cities including Milwaukee, Madison, Waukesha, and Green Bay.

Meanwhile, other authorities urge those hosting New Year's house parties to make sure their guests are safe -- and make a plan for those who get too drunk.

Portage County chief deputy Dan Kontos says that among other things, hosts should collect car keys from guests as soon as they come in -- and give them back only if they're sober enough to drive at the end of the night.

THE number of Irish recruits joining the British army has stabilised after a dramatic decline following threats levelled by dissident Republicans.

Share Facebook Twitter Google Email

Go To

The Ministry of Defence (MOD) had seen the number of Irish citizens joining the British Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy halved in the space of just 12 months following threats to one Royal Irish Regiment recruit from Limerick just days before he was due home on leave.

However, the latest estimates indicate that about 70 Irish recruits joined Britain's security forces in 2013 - roughly the same recruitment level as in 2012.

An official recruitment figure is not yet available.

In 2012, 70 Irish citizens joined the British Army, which contrasts with 123 Irish citizens opting to join in 2011.

That represented a 44pc decline year on year.

MOD sources stressed that there were many factors involved in the fluctuation of recruitment numbers ranging from the scaling down of combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the recession in the Republic and perceived threats from dissident Republicans.

One British Army source said recruits from the Republic were especially prized because most boasted a decent educational background and all wanted to make the military their career.

755|Texas energy company slashes jobs as stock plummets 50%|"In a shocking start to the high school football season in the U.S., after a week one player is dead and another has been paralysed.



Last Wednesday Jasiel Favors, 16, a junior varsity running back at Stony Point High School in Round Rock, Texas, suffered an acute spinal cord injury (broke his neck) leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.



Tyrell Cameron, 16, in his first junior varsity game for Franklin Parish High, in Winnsboro, north Louisiana, suffered an acute spinal cord injury (broke his neck) in a game against Sterlington on Friday night while returning a punt.



After being transported by ambulance from the Franklin Parish field Patriot Stadium, Tyrell died shortly after being admitted to hospital.



While Jasiel Favors comes to grip with his new life he is being treated at Seton Medical Center Williamson in Round Rock, where on Sunday he was operated on to have a a tracheotomy inserted in his throat to assist him in his breathing.



""His attitude hasn't changed since he's been here,"" his mother Debra Favors told the Austin American-Statesman. ""He's had just one bad day. It was overwhelming for him when a bunch of friends came to visit. They were trying to read his lips because they couldn't understand what he was saying, and that frustrated him.""



The young player is being regularly visited by his teammates and coaches. High school Principal Anthony Watson has stopped by the hospital every day to see Jasiel.



Among Jasiel's visitors, according to the Statesman was a 14-year-old boy from Pflugerville who was paralyzed last year in a diving accident. Patrick Messer, sitting in a wheelchair, and his father, Patrick Sr., told Jasiel there is life after paralysis.



""They walked me through all the steps I'm going to need to take with my own son,"" Debra Favors said.



Debra said Jasiel is expected to remain at Seton Medical Center Williamson for at least 2 more weeks. She will travel to Houston on Thursday to visit TIRR Memorial Hermann, a rehabilitation hospital. That's where Patrick Messer underwent rehabilitation after suffering his spinal cord injury last summer.



Meantime teammates, coaches, the Franklin Parish High School principal, teachers and students, and indeed the entire Winnsboro community attended a candlelight vigil at Tyrell Cameron's high school to commemorate his life.



There were six deaths last year in American football, as a direct result of injuries. These involved 5 high school players, and one college player, according to the National Center for Sports Catastrophic Injury Research at the University of North Carolina.



There were no direct fatalities reported in organized youth, professional, or semi-professional levels.



There have been fewer than 10 head and neck injuries per year for each of the past 25 years.



There are currently 4.2 million football players in the U.S. according to the research center."
756|Behind The Scenes, Sony Was A Complete Mess After The Attack|"It’s going to take some time before Sony fully recovers from the attacks.

The recent Sony attack is considered one of the worst cyberattacks in US corporate history. The hackers stole over 100 terabytes of data, including personal data of thousands of employees and business partners.

So it’s not hard to imagine how chaotic it was for the 6,000 employees at Sony.

According to The Wall Street Journal, company email was immediately shut down after the attack, forcing every employee to resort to “an old-style communication network.” They relied on phones, gmail accounts and note pads to reach each other. They even took out old BlackBerrys because of smartphones’ own email servers, while paychecks had to be cut manually, using an old machine.

When Kevin Mandia of the cybersecurity firm FireEye was brought in to clean up the mess, he described the damage as “unprecedented in the history of corporate cyberhacks,” it says.

In fact, despite all the investigation, it’s still unclear who was behind the attacks, and according to the WSJ report, it will take another eight weeks to fully restore Sony’s network.

And if anything, this should all serve as a wake up call to every company in America.

As the WSJ report points out, the way Sony treated corporate security was pretty subpar. Despite suffering from a massive hack in 2011, which resulted in losing personal data of over 100 million Playstation users, Sony seems to have mismanaged its cybersecurity system again. Although it beefed up its security team and firewalls, it still failed to “monitor one firewall and 148 other pieces of computer gear” while turning over its cybersecurity work in-house, the report says.

And this will only result in long-term damages, as Sony CEO Michael Lynton said, “”It took me 24 or 36 hours to fully understand this was not something we were going to be able to recover from in the next week or two.”

On Nov. 24, computer screens of Sony employees flashed a warning indicating the company’s computer systems had been compromised and data had been stolen.

Sony’s systems were crippled. A unknown group calling itself GOP claimed credit for the hack.

Hackers dumped information online and news organisations scrambled to cover every possible angle. Threats of violence against movie theatres led to Sony cancelling the Dec. 25 theatrical release of “The Interview,” a film in which Seth Rogen and James Franco play talk show hosts enlisted by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

American officials have concluded that North Korea was “centrally involved,” and the investigation is ongoing.

The movie was later released online and ended up being shown in some theatres on Christmas Day.

758|Boy in shooting 'unzipped' special purse gun pocket|"© AP Photo/The Spokesman-Review, Kathy Plonka This photo shows Wal-Mart with a shopping cart in the foreground in Hayden, Idaho, Tuesday, Dec. 30, 2014.

SPOKANE, Wash. — Concealed weapons are part of everyday life in Idaho, and that's unlikely to change in the Mountain West state despite a shocking accident in which a 2-year-old boy reached into his mother's purse, got ahold of her gun and shot her in the head inside a Wal-Mart.

Veronica J. Rutledge, 29, was shopping Tuesday morning with her son and three nieces in Hayden, Idaho, when the small-caliber handgun discharged one time, killing her.

Terry Rutledge, Veronica's father-in-law, told The Spokesman-Review that the boy unzipped the special gun compartment in the woman's purse where the weapon was kept while she was looking at clothing.

Terry Rutledge said his daughter-in-law did not put the weapon ""loosely into her purse.""

Victoria Rutledge had a concealed weapons permit, and guns were a big part of Rutledge's life, her father-in-law said.

""She was not the least bit irresponsible,"" Terry Rutledge said in a brief interview with The Associated Press. He complained about people using the incident to attack his daughter-in-law.

Meanwhile, the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office on Wednesday afternoon released a few more details about the incident. The boy removed the 9mm semi-automatic handgun from his mother's purse and shot her once in the head, killing her instantly, the sheriff's office said.

The manager of the store, who was nearby when the shot was fired, stepped in and took the firearm from the child, the sheriff's office said. The manager and other employees secured the scene and evacuated customers.

The woman's purse was new and was designed to carry a concealed firearm, the sheriff's office said. Detectives continue to analyze video from the store, examine the weapon and interview witnesses, the sheriff's office added.

Terry Rutledge told The Washington Post that Veronica Rutledge and her husband practiced at shooting ranges and each had a concealed weapons permit. He said for Christmas this year, her husband gave her the purse with a special zippered pocket for a concealed weapon.

About 7 percent of adults in Idaho had concealed weapons permits at the end of 2012, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. That ranked Idaho among the top third of states.

Kootenai County, which has about 140,000 residents, has issued close to 16,000 concealed weapons permits, Kootenai County sheriff's spokesman Stu Miller said Wednesday.

""It's very commonplace in northern Idaho for folks to have a concealed weapons permit,"" Miller said, and most businesses do not prohibit firearms.

Veronica Rutledge lived in Blackfoot, in southeastern Idaho, and her family had come to the Hayden area to visit relatives for Christmas.

She was an employee of the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho, where she was a nuclear scientist. The laboratory supports the U.S. Department of Energy in nuclear and energy research and national defense.

""We're deeply saddened by this tragedy,"" said Nicole Stricker, a spokeswoman for the lab.

Rutledge graduated from high school in Harrison, a lakeside town in the Idaho Panhandle. She was the valedictorian of her class. She graduated from the University of Idaho with a degree in chemistry.

She had taken the children to Wal-Mart on Tuesday morning to spend their Christmas gift cards, family members said. Her young son, her only child, was in a shopping cart.

Responding deputies found Rutledge dead in the electronics section of the Wal-Mart in Hayden, a rural town of about 12,000 people 40 miles northeast of Spokane.

Colt Rutledge, 32, arrived at the store in Idaho's northern panhandle shortly after the shooting around 10:20 a.m. Tuesday, Miller said. All the children were taken to a relative's house.

Officers viewed surveillance video provided by the store to determine what happened, Miller said.

Like other Western states, gun rights are a big issue in Idaho. State lawmakers passed legislation earlier this year allowing concealed weapons on the state's public college and university campuses. Despite facing opposition from all eight of the state's university college presidents, lawmakers sided with gun-rights advocates who said the law would better uphold the Second Amendment.

Terry Rutledge told the AP that his daughter-in-law ""was a beautiful, young, loving mother.""

""She was taken much too soon,"" he said.

759|Another hanged in Peshawar for attack on Musharraf|"Strict securi­ty enforc­ed during execut­ion, unauth­orised person­s not allowe­d in the vicini­ty of the prison­

PESHAWAR: A convict involved in an attack on former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf was executed in Central Jail, Peshawar on Wednesday morning, Express News reported.

Niaz Muhammed, a former Pakistan Air Force junior technician, 40, was convicted for his involvement in the attempted suicide attack on Musharraf on December 25, 2003 in Rawalpindi and was handed the death sentence by a military court in 2006.

Following his execution, the body was handed over to his family, doctors had said.

Strict security was enforced during the execution and unauthorised persons were not allowed in the vicinity of the prison.

In the wake of the recent attack on Peshawar’s school children by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had lifted the six-year moratorium on death penalties.

Following the resumption of executions, two high-profile terrorists were executed on December 20, followed by a further four on December 22 – all involved in attempted attacks on Musharraf.

Officials have said they plan to hang 500 convicts in the coming weeks, drawing protest from international human rights campaigners.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has also announced the establishment of military courts for terror-related cases in order to accelerate trials, describing them as “an extraordinary solution to an extraordinary problem.”

Despite the moratorium, which began in 2008, courts continued to issue death sentences and Amnesty International estimates there are around 8,000 people on death row in Pakistan.

The United Nations, European Union, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called on Pakistan to re-impose its moratorium on the death penalty.

Rights campaigners say Pakistan overuses its anti-terror laws and courts to prosecute ordinary crimes."
760|What the cluck? Start-up cooks up a new burger|"One food industry veteran has some beef with the traditional store-bought burgers. He says he can do healthy burgers better.

""It's 52 percent less fat, has 34 percent fewer calories and it's also certified gluten free,"" pitched Steve Gold, founder of burger start-up Cluck 'n Moo.

Watch the above video to see Gold cook up his 60-second pitch to a panel with Chef Huda of ""Cutthroat Kitchen,"" Nick Marsh, CEO of Chop't Creative Salad Co., and Nikhil Kalghatgi, partner at Vast Ventures. Will the ""Power Pitch"" panel eat up his chicken and beef hybrid or call it unappetizing?

© Provided by CNBC

As a former vice president of sales and marketing for major poultry supplier Murray's Chicken, Gold has more than 30 years in the food industry under his belt.



""With my guidance, Murray's was the first to introduce antibiotic-free chicken and turkey burgers,"" he told CNBC. Gold then hatched Cluck Inc. back in 2003.



The brand currently offers three items: a preshaped chicken burger with grass-fed beef, another preshaped chicken burger with grass-fed beef and kale, and it also sells the chicken and beef ground mix separately, for those who want to shape their own patties. All three are certified gluten-free.

The start-up produces the burgers in southern New Jersey. ""We use chicken and beef from family farms in the United States that follow our strict humane growing practices,"" said Gold.

The founder has a patent pending on his burgers, but would not disclose specific details.



During the ""Power Pitch,"" Marsh asked, ""Is it appetizing to hear the animals clucking and mooing in my head while I'm eating them?""

""We believe food should be fun. And our goal is to have Cluck 'n Moo and [future brands] Gobble 'n Moo and Oink 'n Moo become spokes-animals to teach kids how to eat healthy, and for families, how to eat healthy together,"" Gold explained.

A July 2014 report by market research firm IBISWorld, projects that revenue for the beef and pork wholesale industry will grow to $50.7 billion in the next five years. The firm also found that the United States is the world's largest beef producer, and that beef is the second most-consumed meat per capita in the U.S., with chicken in the lead. However, IBISWorld also noted that per capita, U.S. beef consumption has declined during the past five years.

But Gold's half beef, half chicken burgers continue to get gobbled up. The products landed on the shelves of major supermarkets like Fairway, ShopRite, Hannaford and Kings, plus the start-up also sells via its own website. The burgers retail for $7.99 to $8.99 for a one-pound box of four, 4-ounce burgers. The founder said Cluck 'n Moo sold close to 78,000 individual burgers last summer.

Although the start-up is not yet profitable, Gold said the company hit $100,000 in monthly sales during the peak of barbecue season from May through September 2014.

Self-funded with a total of $550,000, Cluck 'n Moo is headquartered in West Nyack, New York. The start-up officially launched in March 2014 and plans to roll out turkey burgers called ""Gobble 'n Moo"" in early 2015. Gold anticipates cooking up halal and kosher versions of his products in the near future.

762|Gazprom : Uzbek gas supplies to southern Kyrgyzstan resumed|"Written by TCA

BISHKEK (TCA) — Russia's gas giant Gazprom has agreed with Uzbekistan to resume Uzbek natural gas supplies to the south of Kyrgyzstan , Kyrgyz media reported. The supplies were stopped by Uzbekistan on April 14, 2014 , and the south of Kyrgyzstan stayed without natural gas during 8.5 months.



Tahir Alimov , the deputy director of the Osh branch of Gazprom Kyrgyzstan, was quoted as saying that Uzbekistan resumed gas supplies to Kyrgyzstan's southern Osh province on December 30 .



Gazprom Kyrgyzstan said in a statement that under the contract with Uzbekistan , natural gas supplies to southern Kyrgyzstan will amount to up to 100 million cubic meters. Tariffs for natural gas in the region will remain the same as in the northern part of the country.



It is unclear what prompted Uzbekistan to resume gas supplies to its eastern neighbor.



Uzbekistan suspended gas supplies on April 14 when the contract with Kyrgyzstan expired. That happened soon after Kyrgyzstan officially sold its state gas company Kyrgyzgaz to Russia's Gazprom for a symbolic $1 and promises from the Russian company to overhaul Kyrgyzstan's gas infrastructure.



During his visit to Bishkek in September, Gazprom Chairman Alexey Miller said that his company was ready to start construction of a natural gas pipeline connecting the North and South of Kyrgyzstan .



""Construction of the gas pipeline will solve the issue of provision of the south of Kyrgyzstan with gas in the long-term perspective. The project's approximate cost has already been determined, and the timeframe depends on decision-making. The start of the project depends on the decision of the Kyrgyz side. If the principal decision has been made, Gazprom is ready to fund construction,"" Miller said.



Miller said that the pipeline's length would be about 600 kilometers, the pipe's diameters 500 mm, and the throughput capacity – 240 million cubic meters per year.



In 2007 Gazprom and the Kyrgyz Republic Government signed the Agreement on the common principles for the geological survey of subsurface resources. Under the document, Gazprom obtained two subsurface use licenses for the Kugart and Eastern Mailu-Suu IV blocks in southern Kyrgyzstan .



Kyrgyzstan's proven natural gas reserves are estimated at 6 billion cubic meters. The domestic gas production averages 20 million cubic meters per annum. Gas consumption makes up some 300 million cubic meters per annum, 90 per cent of which is imported from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan ."
763|Oil set for biggest fall since 2008|"Oil fell below $56 (€46.15) a barrel yesterday and was heading for its biggest annual decline since 2008, pressured by weakening demand and a supply glut prompted by the US shale boom and Opec’s refusal to cut output.

The price of global benchmark Brent crude has nearly halved in 2014 as demand growth slowed, the US expanded output and Opec, dropping its strategy of trimming supply to keep oil around $100 a barrel, chose instead to defend market share.

Yesterday, prices came under further pressure from a survey showing China’s factory sector shrank for the first time in seven months in December — a bearish indication on the strength of oil demand in the world’s second-largest consumer.

“Here we are on the very last session of the year and Brent is making new lows, again,” said Tony Machacek, an oil broker at Jefferies Bache in London.

READ NEXT Funding on the up at CIT’s Rubicon

“There’s no reason to see why the downtrend should not continue.”

Brent was down $1.72 at $56.18 by 8.26am, after earlier dropping to $55.81, its weakest since May 2009. US crude was down $1.19 at $52.93.

The annual decline for Brent is set to be the biggest since 2008, when demand crumbled in response to the financial crisis.

Prices were, eventually, propped up by Opec’s last formal decision to cut production.

In contrast, Opec at a November 27 meeting this year decided against a cutback to defend its market share against shale oil and other competing supply sources, despite its own forecasts of a growing surplus in 2015.

Turmoil in Libya has effectively led to a drop in Opec supply in December to a six-month low, a Reuters survey showed on Tuesday, though forecasts still point to a large excess supply next year.

Traders will focus on the latest US government report on oil inventories to see if it confirms the unexpected increase in stockpiles reported on Tuesday by industry group the American Petroleum Institute.

US crude inventories rose by 760,000 barrels last week, the API said, compared with analysts’ expectations for a fall of around 100,000 barrels.

The Obama administration on Tuesday bowed to months of growing pressure over a 40-year-old ban on exports of most domestic crude, taking two steps expected to increase the flow of ultra-light oil, or condensate, onto the global market."
764|John McCain Taking Steps To Squash Arizona Tea Party?|"John McCain, the Arizona Republican Senator who ran as an ultra-conservative in his 2008 presidential bid, has seemingly done a political 180. McCain has always donned the moniker of a political “Maverick” in the Republican party because he has worked with the other side of the aisle.

Now, according to Politico, he seems to want to crush what should be an ally that exists within his own party. Though, it might come as no surprise to many that the Tea Party and Senator McCain are not good bedfellows.

The Oregonian states it was the Tea Party who started the political war. In January, the conservative wing of the Republican party, struck Senator McCain with a censure. The censure, which apparently holds little power to affect the McCain’s senatorial seat, was put to a “voice” vote in Maricopa County.

The resolution was passed by a 1,150-to-351 vote. The Tea Party vote listed a number of what the party called “disastrous” and “harmful” policy decisions toward Arizona and the country. The “liberal” policy record he holds included votes for amnesty, and a refusal to defund Obamacare are among the charges. The amnesty charge comes from the fact that Arizona is border state, and the issue has been boiling over the past several years. The Inquisitr reported on the ongoing fights over illegal immigration.

The wording of the resolution was very serious and stern in its declaration, the Arizona Repubic reports.

“Only in times of great crisis or betrayal is it necessary to publicly censure our leaders. Today we are faced with both. For too long we have waited, hoping Senator McCain would return to our Party’s values on his own. That has not happened.”

Despite the fact the original report did not utilize the term “Tea Party,” but merely “Maricopa County Republican Party,” John McCain in recent months chose to strike at state Tea Party leaders. Politico suggests John McCain is “getting his revenge” on “Tea Party agitators”. His “revenge” would appear to be to unseat influential Tea Party held positions throughout the state.

McCain’s focus has been on state “precinct committeeman.” According to Politico, these positions determine how state and local Republican Party funds are spent, which candidates are promoted in an election year, and which political issues are highlighted. Prior to local elections on August 26, the majority of the positions were held by Tea Party Republicans.

Now, 40 percent of the positions are held by committeeman that are “McCain friendly.” Gordon James, a John McCain advisor, says there has been a “huge organizational” effort that are “hostile” to John McCain. The fact that Senator McCain and his allies are seemingly intentionally shutting out Tea Party opposition, Mr. James finds this to be a good thing.

“A lot of the party folks who were hostile to John McCain have been marginalized, and that’s a good thing.”

Two such purported Tea Party committeeman were ousted thus far. Timothy Schwartz, the man who authored the censure resolution, was booted and replaced by a “McCain-aligned” candidate. Another McCain “detractor” and Maricopa Republican Party Chariman, A.J. LaFaro was seemingly forced into resigning when support seemed to dry up.

According to Schwartz, it was “very clear” what was going on, and McCain’s “money” and “prominence” was the cause of the loss of his seat.

“Look, John McCain has prominence and money and influence and because of that he thinks he can ramrod us.”

Since John McCain’s censure, he has started a Super PAC group to crush his opponents in Arizona, ironically called “Arizona Grassroots Action PAC.” It has raised $300,000 so far. Politico reported that this was mostly made up of Gregory Wendt and Gregory Maffei, two long time donors to he Arizona senator.

767|MOJ will evaluate Chen case Monday|"MOJ will evaluate Chen case Monday

TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Former President Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) will not be released on medical parole on the last day of 2014 as many speculated, as the Agency of Corrections (AOC) decided yesterday that it will be holding a new evaluation of Chen's case next Monday.

The remarks were made by Deputy Justice Minister Chen Ming-tang (陳明堂), who stated that the paperwork related to Chen's medical parole application was delayed during transportation from Taichung Prison to the AOC, making it impossible to release the former president before 2015.

Taichung Prison yesterday morning received the medical report from a recent evaluation conducted by a group of experts who recommend that Chen ""be treated outside the prison.""

Heavy Traffic Postpones Deliberation

Cheng Ming-tang claimed that the papers were delivered late due to the heavy traffic and promised that the case will see a result before noon on Jan. 5. ""We call for (the public) to remain calm and rational,"" said the deputy minister.

Taichung Prison, where Chen is being held, sent the documents to Taipei yesterday afternoon, and they arrived in the capital at 5:56 p.m. According to the AOC, not only did the delivery take too long, the agency was also without sufficient information to process Chen's application for medical parole.

As the AOC deemed that the case should be deliberated with the utmost care, a special investigative team will be conducting an evaluation starting Monday morning, ""so we will be reaching our final decision (on whether to release him) after the procedure is finished on Jan. 5,"" said Chen Ming-tang, who added that former Vice President Annette Lu's (呂秀蓮) sit-in and hunger strike would not affect the ultimate decision.

Unnamed AOC officials revealed that the agency was not dedicating off-work time to Chen's case as it was trying to avoid public accusations of the former president being subjected to ""special treatment,"" and usually only inmates suffering from a stroke or serious illnesses are granted immediate or speedy processing of a medical parole application.

Electronic Documents not an Option: MOJ

In response to widespread suspicion that the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) was dragging out Chen's medical parole by technical methods, the deputy justice minister denied the allegations and said that the MOJ had many loose ends to wrap up before a medical parole could be decided on.

While many in the public voiced the possibility that the MOJ could use electronic official documents to avoid transmittance delays, Chen Ming-tang pointed out that the documents concerning the former president's case filled a large box with medical assessment reports, past court verdicts, medical parole application papers, health check-up reports and more, and it would be impossible for the MOJ to obtain electronic copies of all materials.

DPP Slams Government for Indifference

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spokesman Huang Di-ying (黃帝穎) blasted the MOJ for delaying Chen from receiving treatment with their supposedly necessary bureaucratic procedures.

""I hope Chen will receive the best possible medical care after he is granted medical parole and reunited with his family to heal peacefully. This is only humane; society should refrain from viewing this as a political issue,"" said DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文)."
768|Program puts end-of-life decisions in order|"Program puts end-of-life decisions in order

Advertisement

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- It’s a conversation nobody wants to have -- but one that everybody needs to have, especially the older we get.

There’s no easy way to initiate a frank discussion with your loved ones about the family’s preferences in regard to “end-of-life” planning and lifesaving medical intervention.

But far better to do so now -- while you’re capable of making those decisions yourself.

Perhaps you’ve already done so with a living will and/or advance directive. But, historically, there are problems with those documents, says Dr. Stuart Bagatell, an internist with JFK Medical Center and instructor at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University.

“First, because they’re written in legalese, they’re often just too ambiguous to be medically useful,” he explains. “Second, and more importantly, doctors, EMTs, next of kin -- nobody is legally required to follow those often-ambiguous instructions.”

That’s why Bagatell has become one of Florida’s biggest advocates for the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment paradigm -- or POLST (polst.org).

As the movement’s website explains, “The National POLST Paradigm is an approach to end-of-life planning based on conversations between patients, loved ones and health care professionals designed to ensure that seriously ill or frail patients can choose the treatments they want or do not want and that their wishes are documented and honored.”

Law of (some of) the land

Initially conceived in Oregon in the early 1990s, 15 states have enacted POLST laws -- but Florida is not among them.

In states that have passed POLST legislation, the standardized POLST forms that are signed by both patients and their doctors are legally binding.

“They’re medical orders, signed by a physician, so all other health care providers -- nurses, EMTs, paramedics, etc. -- can feel confident and comfortable in following them,” notes Bagatell.

Since moving to South Florida from New Orleans in 2008, Bagatell, a 39-year-old married father of two originally from Long Island, has been passionate about trying to persuade the Florida Legislature to adopt the POLST paradigm.

He’s been working closely with the folks at Florida State University’s Center for Innovative Collaboration in Medicine and Law to further the POLST cause.

In addition, in 2011, he helped launch the POLST pilot program at JFK Medical Center -- where, he says, his colleagues “have been enthusiastic about implementing it.”

Bagatell also travels all over Palm Beach County explaining the POLST paradigm to residents of nursing homes, assisted living facilities and physical rehab centers.

For those who want to fill out a POLST form -- which includes sections on cardiopulmonary resuscitation, medical interventions, artificially administered nutrition and palliative care -- Bagatell walks them through the process.

Bagatell has observed that “most people tend to feel a sense of relief after making their end-of-life wishes known.”

And, while the POLST paradigm was first created for those facing terminal conditions, Bagatell believes “everyone -- no matter their age -- can benefit from filling out this form.”

After all, a serious accident or sudden illness could thrust any of us into a life-threatening crisis.

Perhaps, then, we should all make the completion of a POLST form one of our New Year’s resolutions.

770|Government blocks 32 websites including GitHub, DailyMotion, PasteBin and more – Tech2|"In yet another case of mass blocking of websites, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has issued an order to block as many as 32 websites including popular sites such as SourceForge, DailyMotion, GitHub, Pastebin and so on. The DoT has issued the order under section 69A of the Information Technology(IT) act, 2000 and the IT act Rules, 2009.

The Section 69A of the IT Act, 2000 states “Power to issue directions for blocking for public access of any information through any computer resource”. Based on the DoT directive internet service providers have blocked access to 32 websites.

According to Arvind Gupta, the national head of BJP’s IT cell, the said websites have been blocked due to security reasons. He tweeted out the reasoning behind DoT’s decision to block the said sites.

The websites that have been blocked were based on an advisory by Anti Terrorism Squad, and were carrying Anti India content from ISIS. 1/2 — Arvind Gupta (@buzzindelhi) December 31, 2014

The sites that have removed objectionable content and/or cooperated with the on going investigations, are being unblocked. 2/2 — Arvind Gupta (@buzzindelhi) December 31, 2014

The entire order to block the sites was shared by policy director at Bangalore-based Centre for Internet and Society Pranesh Prakash on his twitter account.

While security concern is a valid point, the idea of blocking particular objectionable URL’s (that is again, debatable as ‘objectionable’ is quite a vague term) rather than entire websites seems a bit odd. And we have, in the past, seen websites as well as torrent sites being blocked based on John Doe orders.

In the current batch of blocked websites we have Vimeo and DailyMotion- which are YouTube like video sharing websites; GitHub is a forum where software developers host and share programming code and so on.

According to Gupta, Vimeo.com has been unblocked some hours ago and should be accessible. He said that websites which will comply with the Anti Terrorism Squad directives will be unblocked.

772|Maybe New Jersey is to blame? - Dave Ross|"A young Mom takes a group of kids to the Walmart in Hayden, Idaho including her 2-year-old boy. The boy starts exploring her purse, which, in most cases, means the keys fall out or the credit cards get scattered and the child comes away learning you don't play with mommy's purse.

Not this time.

""A small child accessed a concealed weapon that was inside the victim's purse and discharged it, striking the victim. And she's deceased on scene,"" explained a police officer.

The mom probably had the gun to protect herself and her children, and she had every right to carry it.

The police don't want to blame the victim, but what else can they say?

""I'm a big proponent of a concealed weapon for your own safety,"" said the officer. ""However, you have to be responsible. Unfortunately, all the precautionary measures weren't taken to ensure the safety of the weapon.""

If only you could buy a childproof gun. It would make sense in a country where so many moms carry them.

It turns out they do exist, some of them can sense fingerprints. One model uses a special wrist watch so that the gun can be fired only when it's in your hands. As soon as the gun loses radio contact with the watch, it is automatically deactivated.

So the smart guns exist, but there is extreme pressure not to sell them because of a law in New Jersey which says that the moment any company sells a smart gun, all guns shops in New Jersey must begin to convert their inventory to smart guns. Maybe it's time to repeal that law and let the market decide."
773|Women with atypical hyperplasia are at higher risk of breast cancer|"Mammograms showing a normal breast (left) and a cancerous breast (right). Credit: Wikipedia. Women with atypical hyperplasia of the breast have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than previously thought, a Mayo Clinic study has found. Results of the study appear in a special report on breast cancer in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Atypical hyperplasia of the breast is a precancerous condition found in about one-tenth of the over 1 million breast biopsies with benign findings performed annually in the United States. Viewed under a microscope, atypia contains breast cells that are beginning to grow out of control (hyperplasia) and cluster into abnormal patterns (atypical). Atypia lesions are considered benign, but by its risk and appearance and genetic changes, they exhibit some of the early features of cancer.

Data from hundreds of women with these benign lesions indicate that their absolute risk of developing breast cancer grows by over 1 percent a year. The study found that after five years, 7 percent of these women had developed the disease; after 10 years, that number had increased to 13 percent; and after 25 years, 30 percent had breast cancer.

The finding places the more than 100,000 women diagnosed each year with atypical hyperplasia—also known as atypia—into a high-risk category, where they are more likely to benefit from intense screening and use of medications to reduce risk.

""By providing better risk prediction for this group, we can tailor a woman's clinical care to her individual level of risk,"" says Lynn Hartmann, M.D., an oncologist at Mayo Clinic and lead author of the study. ""We need to do more for this population of women who are at higher risk, such as providing the option of MRI screenings in addition to mammograms and encouraging consideration of anti-estrogen therapies that could reduce their risk of developing cancer.""

Previous research has shown that women with atypia have a fourfold to fivefold increased ""relative risk""—meaning that they are four to five times more likely to develop breast cancer than women who don't have these lesions. But few studies have had the patient numbers and follow-up time to report the patients' ""absolute risk""—the chance that she will develop breast cancer over a certain period of time.

To clearly define this risk, the Mayo Clinic team followed 698 women with atypia who had been biopsied at Mayo Clinic between 1967 and 2001. They reviewed pathology and medical records, and used patient follow-up questionnaires to determine which women developed breast cancer and when. The researchers found that after an average follow-up of 12.5 years, 143 women had developed the disease.

Importantly, the Mayo findings were validated by researchers at Vanderbilt University using biopsies from a separate cohort of women with atypia. Both data sets revealed that at 25 years following biopsy, 25 to 30 percent of these women had developed breast cancer.

The Mayo team had previously showed that two common statistical risk prediction models (the BCRAT and the IBIS models) performed poorly in women with atypical hyperplasia, underscoring the need to provide alternative approaches for predicting risk in this population.

""Instead of relying on a statistical model, our study provides actual data of breast cancer cases that occurred in a population of women with atypia. These absolute risk data are preferable to a hypothetical model,"" says Amy Degnim, M.D., co-lead author and a breast surgeon at Mayo Clinic.

The researchers were able to give an even more accurate estimate of risk by incorporating information from a patient's pathology specimen. They found that as the extent of atypia in a biopsy increased, as measured by the number of separate atypia lesions or foci, so did the woman's risk of developing breast cancer. For example, at 25 years post-biopsy, 47 percent women with three or more foci of atypia in the biopsy had developed breast cancer, compared to only 24 percent of women with one focus.

Based on these results, the research team recommends that women with atypical hyperplasia be recognized as having significantly increased lifetime risk of breast cancer and thus be candidates for screening MRI. Moreover, anti-estrogen medications like tamoxifen have already been tested in clinical trials in women with atypia and shown to lower their risk of breast cancer by 50 percent or more. Yet, Dr. Degnim says, many women with atypia are not taking the medications, in part because they and their physicians have not had solid estimates of their breast cancer risk to guide them.

774|Mental health advocate selected South Cobb s 14 Citizen of the Year|"Mental health advocate selected South Cobb’s ’14 Citizen of the Year



Kathy Breen was honored in May as the South Cobb Citizen of the Year for 2014. She is the president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, South Cobb affiliate. / Staff-Kelly J. Huff slideshow

MARIETTA — Kathy Breen of Powder Springs was drawn to mental health advocacy when a family member was diagnosed with a mental illness. She began working with the National Alliance on Mental Illness’ South Cobb affiliate in 1996 and has served as secretary, treasurer and vice president before landing her current role as president.“I’m the go-to person for Cobb County” on mental health issues, she said. “Basically, I just work with people. People call from all over the United States … I do the best I can to help them out and let them know they’re not alone, that mental health affects everybody.”In addition to NAMI, Breen is also a member of the Cobb Community Collaborative, where she serves as the mental health advocate and works with the group’s policy council on homelessness. She said she has been politically active in the capitol, writing letters to legislators as an advocate for the mentally ill.For her advocacy work, Breen was recently named the South Cobb Citizen of the Year by the South Cobb Rotary Club and Cobb Chamber of Chamber of Commerce’s South Cobb Area Council.“It’s a wonderful experience,” Breen said. “There are many other people a lot more worthy, I think, than myself, but it was an honor.”Breen is the president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness’ South Cobb affiliate, one of two affiliates in Cobb County. NAMI is a national mental health organization based in Arlington, Virginia, that advocates for access to services, treatment, support and research.Mildred Cunard, who said she has known Breen for about 40 years, nominated Breen for the award. When Cunard retired as the head of the South Cobb NAMI, which she founded about 30 years ago, she said she had no problem handing the reins to Breen.“She’s one of the sweetest, most intelligent, kind and dedicated people I’ve eve+r met in my life,” Cunard said. “She makes life more pleasant for anyone who has any kind of mental disorder. She pays no attention to race or status of anybody. She’s got a kind heart and there’s no boundaries in her life as far as everybody is concerned; if they need her help, she’s there for them.”Breen said her biggest goal is to break the stigma of mental illness. She also said too many people are ignorant of its causes, and its importance as a public health issue. She said her work is about communicating to people that those with mental illness are human beings and just like everybody else in that regard, adding ignorance plays a big role in the stigma surrounding mental illness.“The brain is part of the body,” she said. “You either understand it or you don’t. You’ve got to understand it to move forward.”In the wake of the actor Robin Williams’ suicide, awareness surrounding mental health, particularly depression, became a national topic of conversation. Breen said while it was good people were talking about mental health, the attention waned after a while and not enough progress was made.“The sad thing is, and this is just going off of my years of experience,” she said, “(awareness) is really tremendous for a short period of time but then it just fades away, it’s like other news stories.”Breen said during her time with the South Cobb NAMI, she has seen many improvements, including the groundbreaking of a behavioral health center in Marietta.In May, state and local officials broke ground on the 19,000-square-foot center at 1775 County Services Parkway in Marietta, which is expected to open in spring 2015.Breen said the center is part of a settlement Georgia reached with the federal government following a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice that alleged unlawful segregation of individuals with mental illness and developmental disabilities in state hospitals. She also said people had died in hospitals because of this negligence.Gov. Nathan Deal attended the groundbreaking, alongside his wife, Sandra Deal, and said the federal lawsuit caused a burden on the state, but added the center will provide a valuable resource for Cobb.“Sometimes when life is a puzzle, it’s hard to see how the pieces fit together,” Deal said at the groundbreaking.Breen said she appreciates Deal being proactive about mental health issues.“He is the first governor that has ever supported Mental Health Day in the Capitol,” she said.She also pointed to the creation of a mental health court in Cobb as a positive step forward. Last year, the Cobb Board of Commissioners authorized the creation of Cobb’s first mental health court, which is overseen by Superior Court Judge Mary Staley.Tom Charron, administrator for the Superior Court, has said the goal of the mental health court is to keep non-violent offenders who have committed a felony and who have a mental illness, such as bipolar disorder, out of jail and in a treatment program.Charron said the Cobb County jail spends $252,000 a year on mental health medications. While it costs $58 a day to incarcerate an inmate, Charron said it costs $78 a day to incarcerate one with mental health issues.Breen said the court is a big deal because not only does it save money but it also ensures people with mental health problems are given treatment rather than simply being incarcerated.“If someone has a mental health issue, they’re now able to get both treatment and help to deal with the situation,” she said.She said in both November and December, her NAMI affiliate fed and gave gifts to about 100 people each month. She said NAMI partners with Davis Funeral Home and WellStar to do so, noting it was Cunard who started the program.“There’s a lot of positive things going on in Cobb County in regard to getting information out there,” she said. “I remember going to NAMI (meetings) back in the ’90s, there was only like, four or five members who would attending meetings. Now we’re up to about 25 or 30.”For more information or to get involved, visit www.nami.org or www.namiga.com. South Cobb NAMI meets the third Thursday and the fourth Tuesday of each month at the Macland Presbyterian Church at 3615 Macland Road in Powder Springs. Meetings run from 7 to 8:30 p.m."
775|Asymptomatic bacteriuria no more prevalent in female ARD patients than healthy controls|"In the Journals

Asymptomatic bacteriuria appeared to be prevalent among immunocompromised women with autoimmune rheumatic disease, but it was no more common in this population than in healthy women, according to recent study data.

In a case-controlled, prospective study, researchers evaluated 260 consecutive women who presented with autoimmune rheumatic disease (ARD) to the outpatient rheumatology clinic of a tertiary care hospital in Athens, Greece. Eligible patients were seen between February 2010 and April 2012, were aged older than 14 years and had no baseline symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI). The researchers also enrolled age-matched women (n=238) attending the hospital’s ambulatory endocrinology clinic for comparison.

All patients and controls were screened at baseline for asymptomatic bacteriuria through two urine cultures within 1 week. Baseline data also were collected, including demographic characteristics, type and duration of ARD, diabetes mellitus history and history of UTI.

The researchers found that 93.5% of ARD patients were undergoing treatment with immunosuppressive agents. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was identified in 24 of the ARD patients (9.2%) and in 22 of the control patients (9.2%; P=1). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen detected (66%) in the ARD patients. Among the independent predictors of asymptomatic bacteriuria were diabetes (adjusted OR=6.597; 95% CI, 1.633-26.649) and ARD duration longer than 84 months (aOR=4.428; 95% CI, 1.287-15.232). Nine patients with baseline asymptomatic bacteriuria remained bacteriuric for the 1-year study period, while 11 were sporadically bacteriuric. Four of the 24 patients (16.7%) with asymptomatic bacteriuria at baseline developed symptomatic UTI, while 29 of the 236 patients (12.3%) without baseline asymptomatic bacteriuria developed symptomatic UTI (P=.522).

According to the researchers, these findings suggest screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in women with ARD may not be warranted.

“The occurrence of [asymptomatic bacteriuria] was detected in a substantial proportion of immunocompromised women with ARD studied; however, its prevalence was not significantly higher than that of age-matched women without ARD,” they wrote. “At 12 months of follow-up, baseline [asymptomatic bacteriuria] was persisting in the majority of the patients, but it was not associated with higher risk for symptomatic or severe UTI. Thus, screening for or treatment of [asymptomatic bacteriuria] in women with ARD does not appear justified.”

Disclosure: The researchers report no relevant financial disclosures."
776|Liberman: PA Provocations Won’t Lead to Any Achievements|"Foreign Minister, Avigdor Liberman, said that the failed Palestinian Authority bid to the UN Security Council must teach the PA that provocations and attempts to force unilateral processes upon Israel will not lead to any achievements, but rather the opposite.

According to Liberman, “The PA’s mockery of the most important countries in the international community, headed by the US, stems from the backing it received from some European countries. Thus, it is up to any country truly interested in furthering accords, to act responsibly and make it clear to the PA that decisions are only made around the negotiations table.”"
777|Man shot, killed by Missoula police officer was strangling girlfriend|"MISSOULA -- The Missoula man who was killed by a city police officer Wednesday morning was allegedly strangling his girlfriend in the car before the officer fired the lethal shot.

Authorities haven't released the names of the officer or the deceased man.

Police initially responded to a 9-1-1 domestic disturbance call at a Missoula home involving two women and the 20-year-old man. The time was 2:04 a.m.

The man fled the scene, taking his girlfriend hostage, Missoula County sheriff's spokeswoman Paige Pavalone explained Wednesday afternoon.

""He was non-compliant with the officers' instructions and negotiation efforts,"" Pavalone said.

According to a written report issued by the sheriff's office, the intoxicated man led police through downtown and along West Broadway. Officers attempted to apprehend him in front of Safeway, but he fled again, leading officers on a high-speed chase further west on Broadway.

He attempted to drive the wrong way up the North Reserve Street ramp, where his car inexplicably stopped, Pavalone said.

""The vehicle just died,"" she said. ""They don't know how it died. It could have been because it ran out of gas, but that will be determined later.""

Pavalone said the man wasn't using a weapon to threaten the woman, but was strangling her before the officer fired his gun – fatally wounding the man. The time was 3:18 a.m.

It was unclear if the man had a weapon in his car or concealed on him, and authorities would not provide that information on Wednesday.

It's also unclear whether or not the officer shot through the driver's-side window or if the suspect stepped out of the car before he was shot. Pavalone said that information would be revealed later in the investigation.

Missoula police spokesman Travis Welsh confirmed the city police officer has been placed on administrative leave, per standard procedure.

The man's body was lying on the icy North Reserve Street ramp, alongside the light-colored Buick and partially covered in a white sheet from the time of the shooting until about 10:23 a.m., when his body was moved to the Montana State Crime Lab.

He appeared to be wearing shorts and wasn't wearing shoes. The driver's-side window was shattered.

Pavalone said officers blocked off the area and waited to investigate the scene until daylight. Because it was an officer-involved shooting, a civilian coroner was called from Sanders County to assist with the investigation. She asked that the body not be moved until she arrived.

Sanders County Coroner Kathy Harris arrived on scene shortly after 10 a.m.

Missoula County sheriff's deputies and detectives, led by Lt. Scott Newell, are conducting the investigation because a city officer shot the man.

The on/off ramp reopened around 11:30 a.m. after a tow truck moved the man's car and the Missoula Fire Department cleared the area."
778|Cuba frees dissidents from crackdown condemned by U.S|"By Daniel Wallis and Daniel Trotta

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba freed some leading dissidents on Wednesday after holding them overnight to thwart an unauthorised demonstration in a crackdown that has tested its new detente with the United States.

Police arrested several political opponents on Tuesday and kept others under virtual house arrest ahead of an open microphone protest that was to have taken place outside the communist government headquarters in Havana's Revolution Square.

The detentions were typical of how Cuba breaks up opposition protests but took on greater significance coming just two weeks after U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro said on Dec. 17 they would restore diplomatic ties and end decades of hostility.

Among those released on Wednesday was performance artist Tania Bruguera, who organised the demonstration. After about an hour of freedom, she was picked up again by police and lectured for about two-and-a-half hours, she said.

Between her back-to-back detentions, she told Reuters in an interview that she planned to hold a similar, scaled down event on the seafront near her mother's home. But as she walked toward it she was picked up by plainclothes officers for a second time.

The planned event never took place.

""I'm not doing this as a dissident, I'm doing it as a normal person,"" she said at her mother's apartment just minutes before her second arrest. ""I'm not a counter-revolutionary, like they say. I'm from a revolutionary family. ... I'm going to continue the project."""
779|Experts: It was a busy year for disease control|"Posted Wednesday, December 31, 2014 6:00 am

NEW YORK (AP) - Health officials are celebrating some important victories in 2014, and Time magazine even named Ebola fighters the persons of the year. Nevertheless, this was a black-eye year for public health.

Some vital vaccines did not work well. Federal laboratories were careless with dangerous pathogens. And international health officials failed to stop a West Africa outbreak from exploding into the worst Ebola epidemic ever.

Such failings occurred during one of the busiest 12 months of contagions in at least a decade. In the United States, infectious disease menaces seemingly whizzed at us from every direction, from Ebola and enterovirus to measles and MERS. Mumps plagued Ohio. California saw its worst whooping cough outbreak in 70 years. And a mosquito-borne disease called chikungunya burned through the Caribbean and took root in the United States.

The last time U.S. health officials were this frantic was 2009, when a flu pandemic swept the globe. ""But that was one disease,"" while 2014 had more of a variety of fires to put out, said Dr. Marci Layton of New York City's health department.

Experts say this year's tumult was caused by a combination of things. Many cite the impact of international travel, which can bring an exotic disease from the jungles of Africa or the desserts of the Middle East to a U.S. airport in a matter of hours.

""If anyone still needed convincing, 2014 really showed that a disease threat anywhere is a disease threat everywhere,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But experts say others factors this year were shortcomings and errors at CDC and in other public health organizations.

The leading example was the Ebola epidemic. Previous outbreaks numbered in the hundreds. As of mid-December, health officials were reporting this year's epidemic had sickened more than 18,600 people, the vast majority in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Of those, more than 6,900 died.

Those three nations were not prepared for Ebola. Health systems were weak. Doctors were scarce in many areas. Ebola was sometimes mistaken for malaria, and care and infection control were poor.

An aid effort was led by the World Health Organization. But the WHO staff let bureaucratic bungles delay important work and was hampered by budget cuts and responsibilities elsewhere, a WHO internal report later concluded.

For months, the WHO got only limited help from various nations, and it wasn't until the late summer that the U.S. and other countries pledged more substantial assistance.

The CDC was in charge of the U.S. Ebola response, and initially everything seemed well under control. CDC sent teams to help in West Africa. Frieden repeatedly assured Americans they were safe from an Ebola outbreak here and that U.S. hospitals were able to isolate and handle any cases that should arrive from West Africa.

But public confidence was shaken after a Liberian visitor Thomas Eric Duncan came down with Ebola in late September, days after he arrived in Dallas. He died Oct. 8, and two nurses who treated him at a Dallas hospital were infected. How the nurses caught Ebola was unclear, but Frieden later said he should have sent a much larger team to Dallas initially to help hospital workers prevent any spread of the virus.

No one besides Duncan died of Ebola in the United States, and no other transmission of the disease was ever reported, and yet Frieden came under heavy criticism for the CDC's handling of Ebola. Some politicians called for his dismissal. President Obama stuck with Frieden but appointed an 'Ebola czar' to help coordinate the government's response.

Some other lowlights from 2014:

-In January, a CDC lab scientist in Atlanta accidently mixed a deadly strain of bird flu with a tamer strain, and the mix was later sent to unaware workers at two other labs. In June, another CDC lab failed to kill anthrax samples before sending them to two labs with fewer safeguards for containing dangerous germs. No one got sick from either incident, fortunately. The anthrax lab director resigned and administrative action was taken against ""a few"" other employees, a CDC spokesman said.

-Another startling lab failing was discovered at the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. A scientist cleaning out an old storage room discovered forgotten, 60-year-old vials of smallpox virus, one of the most lethal infectious agents in human history. No one got sick from that incident, either. But government lab practices became both a point of concern and something of a joke.

-In May, health officials identified a doctor who traveled from Saudi Arabia to Indiana as the first U.S. case of Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. They also said the doctor apparently had spread MERS to an Illinois man he'd met in a business meeting. But what initially seemed to be the first transmission of MERS in this country wasn't. CDC officials backtracked when additional testing showed the virus had not, in fact, spread to the second man.

-Researchers have come to believe the vaccine that's been used since the 1990s against whooping cough does a poor job of preventing spread of the disease. Health officials believe that failing was an important contributor to an epidemic this year in California, where nearly 10,000 cases were reported through the end of November. Only 10 percent of children sickened in the epidemic had not been vaccinated against pertussis, according to a review of available records.

-This was the worst year for measles since 1994. About 600 cases were reported in Americans through the first week of December - more than the combined total from the previous five years. The measles vaccine seemed to work fine. The vast majority were unvaccinated people who fell sick in outbreaks sparked by a traveler who picked up the disease in another country and then spread it in the United States.

-Enterovirus 68, a respiratory virus that traditionally kept a low profile, became a national health concern in the late summer as some pediatric hospitals were flooded with wheezing children. Worries hit a new level when doctors noted some children with the virus also developed weakness or paralysis in their arms or legs. By early December, more than 1,100 infected people in 48 states had respiratory illness, including 12 who died. CDC also had reports of paralysis in 94 children in 33 states, though investigators are still trying to establish whether enterovirus 68 was the cause.

Infectious diseases are a continuing threat, and no one should think of 2014 as an aberration, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert.

""I think what we really hit is a new normal,"" he said.

Indeed, it could get worse. Osterholm noted that Ebola and MERS barely touched the U.S. this year, and worrisome forms of influenza in Asia and elsewhere may be on the horizon. Arrivals of people from overseas - and whatever germs they're carrying - are forecast to keep growing. And adding to the threat of new bugs is the revived menace from old ones, as once-treatable germs are increasingly becoming resistant to antibiotics, experts said.

To be sure, there were public health success stories in 2014. There were not large U.S. outbreaks of MERS or Ebola. In Africa, though Ebola appeared in Nigeria, Senegal and Mali, it petered out during intense public health responses. The disease is still raging elsewhere, particularly in Sierra Leone, but the U.S. Congress acted to bolster the fight with approval this month of a $5.4 billion emergency appropriation. And some experts say Frieden deserves points for his forthright disclosures about - and attempts to correct - failings as they were discovered.

'Also, the health care and public health workers who went to West Africa did show uncommon heroism, as Time magazine noted. ""The response to Ebola has been extraordinary"" in both its scope and valor, Frieden said.

Some experts say the mistakes of 2014 were constructive. They led, for example, to an intensive review of safety practices at CDC labs and better preparations at U.S. hospitals for handling Ebola and other new infectious diseases that may appear, they said.

""I think finding problems is sometimes a good thing,"" said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a Seattle public health official and national vaccines experts. ""I think all of this helped us"" get ready for what may come next.

780|The Science Nerd Gift Guide|"by Christopher Pilny

Mark Lee Rollins for redOrbit.com - Your Universe Online

First we provided the Tech Nerd Holiday Gift Guide. Then we asked the question, ""What other kinds of nerds are there?"" The answer is: A LOT.

But one of the first nerd-groups that came to mind is one we, the redOrbit staff, bump into (or are related to) often: The Science Nerds. These are the chemistry teachers, the mechanical engineers, the oral surgeons, the PhD students, or the overall Sheldon Coopers in your life.

It's hard even conversing with these people at times; so it's even more difficult figuring out what to get them for the holidays. Thankfully we have Mark Lee Rollins on staff, who is not only a tech nerd, but a devout, Darwin's-beard-loving science nerd. And once again, he has come to our rescue with a reasonably-priced, inventive list of items that'll make even your most reserved science geek shout, ""Bazinga!""

Please note: We only include list prices, as the selling prices change almost daily.

Tools Make the Science Geek

Nothing defines science geeks more than the tools we carry. From the halcyon days of yore--with pocket protectors and slide rules--to the modern-day Bill Nye--armed with a smartphone and BlueTooth 4 accessory--the tools do truly make the nerd. Probably the earliest science geek was that Australopithecine ancestor who discovered one could use a sharp stick to get the biggest, juiciest grubs out of a log.

Although there are no grub extraction tools included, a smartphone case from IN1 Multi Tool Utility Case ($45, various colors and models abound) is, like the quintessential Swiss Army Knife, loaded with a plethora of geeky goodness. A blue & red pen, a Phillips & flat-head screwdriver, kickstand, nail file, tweezers, scissors, and toothpick are hidden inside, TARDIS-like. Due to the size of all the items, it is reportedly TSA-compliant; and we can attest as we have taken one on US and international flights with no problems. Your mileage may vary.

Nice Weather We're Having...?

Any good science geek is concerned about the weather. To further milk the caveman metaphor for all it's worth, some of the first science geeks probably also realized the dark clouds on the horizon meant rain was a-comin'. A good gift could be a remote weather station such as the Backyard Pro Wireless Weather from Oregon Scientific ($150).

The Rollins' have had a similar model in the backyard for about four years, and it's withstood hits from hurricanes, ice storms and hawks (Yes, seriously). Another option that is more smartphone-specific is the Netatmo Weather Station ($180).

Now, both of these stations will tell your geek about the weather when they're at home; but what about when they're away?

Thermodo (from Robocat - $30) is a small temperature sensor one can plug into the headphone jack of their smartphone; and it has a companion App. If you don't want your phone getting wet measuring something important like the temperature of the Gulf Stream, or a Belgian ale, they sell a 20 cm Extension Cable , as well as a 1 m Extension Cable .

(NOTE: As this is a science website, we will be always using the metric system--as opposed to what Dave Barry referred to as ""the real system."" Thus, you'll see meters and grams as opposed to pecks and yards. Beer will, however, continue to be served in pints.)

If you're interested in measuring the wind, ambient temperature, humidity, and pressure, you can do so with the Shaka Meter, from Shakon ($50 - $90, depending on features).

Or, if you're only interested in measuring the wind, there's also the WeatherFlow Wind Meter ($35).

See in the Dark

An infrared (IR) camera is, as you may imagine, able to image the infrared (heat) wavelengths of light, that we humans cannot see. As your science geek may explain, an IR camera shows temperature variations as different colors, so one can check for heat loss from your house, or see who/what is hiding in the bushes. For these purposes, you could get a top-of-the-line FLIR E5: Compact Thermal Imaging Camera ($1,500) but that may be a bit of overkill. (OK, I only included that last part for the sake of my marriage.)

Fortunately there actually are relatively inexpensive, decent IR cameras available. FLIR Systems has the FLIR ONE Thermal Imager for about $350. There is also the Seek Thermal , that has models for iOS and Android ($200), though at press time it was not in stock.

The Good Geek

Any good science geek, upon receipt of their first iPhone, immediately downloaded a noise measuring, or sound-level meter (SLM) App. A good science geek also knows that a proper, calibrated microphone makes for a more accurate SLM.

A couple of good microphones, that include calibration data, are the MicW i436 ($125) and the Dayton Audio iMM-6 ($40).

(Note: Any microphone of this caliber will also make better sound recordings, albeit monophonic.)

Ghostbusters Redux?

Whatever your spiritual beliefs, if there are ghosts around, the Mr.Ghost EMF Detector for iPhone (Protagonist LLC - $20) may help your science geek detect them. It's actually classed as a ""variable scale EMF detector,"" and it functions more as a way of showing the relative strength of magnetic and electric fields around an object. Compare the EMF reading 6 inches from your electric razor to those 6 inches from a running air conditioner or oil furnace. It does not detect ionizing radiation; we will get to that in a few paragraphs.

Laser Sharp Measurements

To use the caveman metaphor for the last time (we promise), measurements in prehistoric times were done with just pieces of stone. This progressed to piece of wood, then rope, then to metal, and full-circle back to stone. Yes, a solid-state laser is a ""stone,"" for all intents and purposes.

Laser measurement tools take very accurate readings; and some like the Prexiso iC4 Laser Meter (from Prexio AG, $60) interface with smartphones and Apps like Magic Plan and My Measures & Dimensions. With the right App and a laser measuring tool, you can visit someone's house, and make plans almost accurate enough to duplicate it. All your science geek needs is a 3-D printer large enough...

Billowing Backpacks, Radioactive Man

There are many reasons that your science geek wants to measure radiation. It could be preparedness in case of a disaster; it could be concern based on proximity to a place that has radiation; they could trying what Harry Daghlian attempted, or it could be they want to verify their Fiestaware collection is real. There are several small Geiger counters that interface with a smartphone.

The iRadG1 detects X-Rays, Gamma and Beta radiation. It sells for about $100, but is also currently out of stock. Another is the Pocket Geiger Type 4 ($95), which is a good option.

An inexpensive yet accurate Geiger counter ($70) we also recommend is from eBay seller ""impexeris."" He's a college physics professor in Lithuania, whom we've had the pleasure of meeting. Couple this with an App like GeigerBot (ND Apps - $4) and you have a device as accurate as one costing hundreds more.

All Work and No Play Makes for a Dull Geek

No we're not advocating overconsumption of alcohol, but if you're of legal age (for your country of residence) there is nothing better than a nice, craftbrewed American-style IPA, an aged Belgian Lambic or even a Bud Light. Problems can arise from overindulgence, though, and your science geek will be able to avoid most of them by measuring their BAC (blood alcohol concentration) in situ, as opposed to the back seat of the local constabulary's vehicle.

Seriously, though, what is better than combining science and beer? Anyway, the Breathometer A01 ($50) is a US FDA-registered breathalyzer, that will tell you if you are over or under the limit in your locale. You could also play the new game ""Guess Your BAC,"" which is not yet sweeping our nation's colleges.

I Can See Clearly Now

There are a lot of precision accessory lenses for smartphones, that do macro, wide-angle, fisheye, and telephoto. But how about the really, really, really close-up? You don't want to take pictures of something moderately close. Your science geek wants to get right down and look at a bacteria.

Fortunately there is the ProScope Micro Mobile Microscope Kit for iPhone 5 (by Bodelin - $150) which is a 80 X microscope that also includes built-in illumination. In case anyone asks, it is not strong enough to image Ebola viruses.

Ultimate Science Geek Gift

We are of course referring to a Tricorder, that ubiquitous Star Trek device that seems to be able to measure everything. Sadly that does not exist in real life. NASA has developed a tiny iPhone accessory that has 64 nano-sensors, but it is - sadly - not available for sale. Yet (hint hint).

The closest thing you will find is the Sensordrone (SensorCon - $200), AND / OR a thumb-sized sensor that connects to your smartphone via BlueTooth 4. It can measure or function as the following

• Precision Gas Sensor

• Reducing Gas Sensor

• Oxidizing Gas Sensor

• Non-Contact Thermometer

• Humidity Sensor

• Temperature Sensor

• Color & Light Sensors

• Barometer, altimeter

• Proximity Sensor

(Wow!) It also has an expansion connector, and there are modules for CO2 (carbon dioxide), pH (acidity), and DO (dissolved oxygen). Did we mention it's thumb-sized?

Science Geek Trick





Now if you really want to gauge how geeky your science geek truly is, try this trick on them. Get this special Gallium Spoon that feels like a stainless-steel spoon, but will dissolve in hot coffee or tea.

The ""acid test"" for your science geek is to see what their reaction is when the spoon melts. If they scream like an extra in the latest teen slasher flick, they are not a true science geek. #Poseur

If they say, ""Ahem, this is obviously a spoon made of gallium, or the eutectic alloy 'Wood's metal,' good show"" then they score 100% on the science geek scale.

If they mention ""Lipowitz's alloy"" they get an extra 10 points.

781|Slash Files For Divorce After 13 Years Of Marriage|"'Tis the time of year for celebrity break ups. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash has filed for divorce from his wife Perla Ferrar after 13 years of marriage.

TMZ reports that the rocker, 49, submitted documents to a Los Angeles court on Tuesday, citing irreconcilable differences.

Slash and Perla separated in June, and the guitarist wants to share physical and legal custody of their sons, London, 12, and Cash, 10.

The couple wed in 2001 in Hawaii. Nine years later, Slash filed for divorce. Two months later, they reconciled. The pair renewed their vows in 2011.



This will be Slash's second divorce. He was previously married to model/actress Renee Suran. They split in 1997 after five years together.

Slash isn't the only star who's headed into the new year with divorce proceedings. Actor Jeremy Renner and his wife have split after just 10 months of marriage. Chris Rock and his wife of 19 years just annouced they were splitting, and celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis revealed on Facebook on Monday that she and her husband of 11 years were parting ways."
782|Morton Salt clean-up continues after avalanche of salt spills onto cars at Acura dealership|"There is a big mess to clean up at Morton Salt in Chicago's Goose Island neighborhood, after an avalanche of salt spilled onto nearly a dozen cars at the McGrath Acura dealership next door. But it could be days until the owners of those cars get their vehicles back, as there are major structural issues with the Morton Salt roof.A wall partially collapsed at the storage facility in the 1300-block of North Elston Avenue around 2 p.m. Tuesday. No one was injured in the downpour, which buried at least three cars and crushed the tops of others.Eleven vehicles were damaged; three of them were new to the dealership. Others belonged to customers waiting for service.Noble Jones, general manager of McGrath Acura, says that building inspectors have been to the site and said the roof needs to be stabilized before any major cleanup can commence, which will take time.The city says the Morton roof, where it reads ""When it rains, it pours,"" had not been maintained in sound condition, and that there was an outstanding violation to that effect. The wall gave way when the road salt inside was piled too high, with too much weight causing too much pressure. Surveillance camera video, not yet made public, shows a cloud of falling salt and brick lasting roughly 90 seconds.The dealership's general manager is thankful his customers and employees are ok.""It happened fast but it gave us a little warning because we can hear bricks and things falling before the wall actually collapsed,"" said Noble Jones, general manager at McGrath Acura. ""We were able to get people out of the way but usually in that area you would have 10-15 people moving cars back and forth.""Structural engineers are trying to determine whether the building can be repaired. Meanwhile, McGrath Acura is working to replace the damaged cars and Morton's salt insurance agents have been to the site and will make good on replacing the cars destroyed by the salt. Jones hopes customers will have new or similar cars in about 15 days."
783|First Ebola victim may have been infected by bats|"A team of researchers think they may have pinpointed how the Ebola epidemic in West Africa started - with a small boy playing in a hollowed-out tree where infected bats lived.

The researchers explored an area in southeastern Guinea where 2-year-old Emile Ouamouno fell ill a year ago and died. Health officials believe he was the first case in the epidemic, which wasn't recognized until spring.

The Ebola virus wasn't found in the bats they tested so they weren't able to prove the source, the scientists reported in a study published Tuesday. But they believe the boy got Ebola from the furry, winged creatures that had lived in the hollow tree.

""As a scientist, I can say it's a possible scenario,"" said one of the study's authors, Fabian Leendertz of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin.

An outside expert said the researchers' work was thought-provoking.

""They didn't find smoking guns"" but perhaps broadened the thinking about what sparked the epidemic, said Stephen Morse, a Columbia University infectious disease expert.

The Ebola epidemic is the worst in world history, blamed for killing nearly 8,000 people across West Africa this year, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The epidemic's exact origin has never been determined, but the virus is thought to spread to people from some sort of animal. Many experts have suspected some species of fruit bat, though some wonder if West Africa's epidemic started through another animal - like a chimpanzee or small antelope - that was perhaps infected by bats and then eaten by people.

The researchers saw no signs that Ebola had affected larger animals around the boy's small village of Meliandou. But they learned that a large colony of small, smelly bats with long tails lived in a hollow tree near the boy's home.

Villagers told the researchers that the tree caught fire in March, causing a ""rain of bats"" to pour out of the tree. The bats were destroyed or gone before the researchers arrived in mid-April - a bad break for the researchers, Leendertz said.

The researchers tested 169 bats, including fruit bats and a few from the species that lived in the tree. None tested positive for Ebola, but that doesn't disprove the hypothesis because experts think the virus may dwell in only a small minority of bats. The researchers are trying to collect more of the bats for testing.

The study was published Tuesday in EMBO Molecular Medicine.

Also on Tuesday, Liberia's government announced it will allow families to bury Ebola victims in a special plot of land instead of requiring that the bodies be cremated so as not to spread the virus.

Ciatta Bishop, head of Liberia's national Ebola burial team, said the government has secured 25 acres where Ebola victims can now be buried. More than 2,000 suspected Ebola victims have been cremated since the cremation decree was ordered at the height of the crisis in Liberia several months ago.

The corpses of Ebola victims are highly contagious, and many of those who washed or touched bodies before the burials contracted the disease.

The cremation decree is highly unpopular in Liberia, where funeral traditions are carefully followed and are considered a sacred obligation to the deceased."
784|Serving charcuterie, with recipes|"Not long ago, a North American charcuterie plate might have featured industrial ‘cold cuts’. We have thankfully, moved on.

If you’ve taken a walk on the wild side this holiday season and visited Oyama Sausage at Granville Island Public Market (where I’ve sent my poor unsuspecting husband) you’ve seen sausage mayhem first-hand. He didn’t expect to be in a sausage mosh pit and wait nearly an hour to buy some cured meats (made by John van der Lieck, a fifth generation sausage maker). Oyama makes over 600 to 700 different house-made sausages over the year. They now provide a ‘fast lane’ to deal with demand and customers can email orders or call ahead and retrieve the goods at a special pickup spot.

In Steveston, D Original Sausage Haus, another member of the same fifth generation family operates another sausage shop, all house made. December is the busiest time of the year because let’s face it, it’s the entertaining-est time of the year. The parent company D Original Sausage Company produces over 4,000 pounds of charcuterie a week which he sells to other retailers as well. When he started up 27 years ago, all customers wanted were summer sausages, hotdogs and Black Forest ham, says owner Drews Driessen. “The Black Forest ham had nothing to do with the real thing which is more like prosciutto. There was a whole world of education to be done,” he says. “Now Vancouverites are very, very curious when it comes to food and this is one of the areas that gets bigger and bigger.”

Chris Duxbury of Greco’s Specialty Foods in White Rock is a D Original customer and most of his charcuterie in his store are locally produced. “It’s crazy over the holidays,” he says. “We usually have 10 staff behind the counter and the counter empties by the end of the day.”

He also imports some amazing products that can’t be replicated here. One is Spanish jamon iberico (Iberico ham) from Iberian black pigs. The best is made from pigs raised on acorns throughout their lives; a lesser grade are fed only during the last part of their lives. The former sells for $70 per 100 gram; the latter, for $24 per 100 gram.

“They’re sweet and melt in the mouth. It’s the sweetness of the nut. You don’t need anything with it but it goes wonderfully with melon. You don’t want to hide the flavour.”

Neil Taylor, chef and owner of Espana Spanish restaurant in Vancouver loves the product and serves it on his restaurant charcuterie board. “It’s got really luscious fat. It melts when touched with your hands. It’s revered around the world for its great flavour. When you carve the ham and put it on the tongue and let it sit, the fat dissolves into a really luxurious creamy taste.”

Another product Greco’s imports is serrano ham (jamon serrano), made from a special breed of white pig. Duxbury says differences in products from country to country is often in what the animals eat. “Italian prosciutto is from grass-fed animals. In Canada, they’re grain fed. You notice it in butter, as well.”

One of his popular salamis, especially during the holiday season is truffle salami, imported from Italy. “It’s got a subtle truffle flavour which comes through in the finish. It melts in the mouth. European sausages have a little more fat content.”

Saucisson sec is one of the most popular sausages. “It’s skinny, dry and you cut it a little thicker. The white on the outside looks like mould but it’s cornstarch to keep it dry.” With other cuts, like the hams and moister salamis, ideally, it’s cut by the vendor into paper-thin slices so it’s almost see-through,” says Duxbury.

“It depends on the salami as to how thin or thick you cut it. Some you want very, very thin but not so wafer thin you don’t get any of it. If it’s too thick, it can be chewy. You have to have enough texture but it should almost dissolve,” says Taylor.

Duxbury suggests serving about four types of sausages on a charcuterie plate, perhaps a prosciutto or serrano ham, a spicy sausage, a sremska (a Serbo Croatian style sausage) and perhaps, saucisson sec. You can keep the platter simple with olives and pickles or make up your own condiments. At Greco’s, you can pick up Italian jellies, caramelized onions, South African papadew peppers in a sweet and hot marinade to go with more assertive sausages, mustards, tapenade, olives, cheeses, and even packaged mini gougeres from England.

Taylor serves his charcuterie with house-made mustard made with Spanish beer, baby pickled onions, and zucchin pickles. “I personally like things simple and not overpowering, especially when serving Iberica hams. It’s not cheap and you want to highlight and make them the stars. I wouldn’t serve that with anymore more than just toast with garlic and olive oil but you could do a quince jam. That’s very Spanish.”

Van der Lieck of Oyama says while some people bypass the madness in his store, others are mesmerized by the 20 flying hands of the 10 servers behind the counter. “Many people show up several times to replenish stocks and watch the whole show again,” he says. Some buy small amounts of 20 to 30 items to wow their guests while others might buy some ham.

For New Year’s he suggests a charcuterie tray of his pate de campagne, duck truffle pate, truffled duck salami, Rioja chorizo, Pacific Sea Salami (made with a rare breed B.C. pork), and jambon de Bayonne (SPCA certified organic pork).

The holidays are the best time for a wide variety, he says. And it’s even a better time to break out a sparkling wine, to serve with charcuterie.

RECIPES

Red cabbage pickles

Chef Ryan Reed of Nomad restaurant keeps these pickles handy to serve alongside various dishes. It’s a shoo-in for a charcuterie plate.

1 large head of red cabbage, sliced and cut into one-inch pieces

4 cloves garlic

1 tbsp (15 mL) pickling spice

4 sprigs of fresh dill

2 1/2 cups (625 mL) white vinegar

2 cups (500 mL) water

2 tbsp (30 mL) salt

Place the cabbage, garlic, pickling spice and dill into a container.

Heat vinegar, water and salt and bring to a boil. Pour the hot pickling liquid over the cabbage.

When cooled down to room temperature, cover and refrigerate. The pickles will taste best after a week or more. If properly covered, they will last in the fridge for 3 months.

Makes about 1 quart.

Cherry mostarda

Mostarda refers to all sorts of spiced fruit compotes in the Venice and Lombardy regions of Italy. It’s made to partner with cured meats and cheeses and why not slip some into a sandwich, too. This is from America Farm to Table by Mario Batali and Jim Webster.

2 cups (500 mL) dried cherries

1/2 cup (125 mL) dried cranberries

3 cups (750 mL) moscato d’Asti or other sweet muscat-based wine

2 cups (500 mL) sugar

1/4 cup (60 mL) English mustard powder, like Colman’s

2 tbsp (30 mL) mustard seeds

1 tbsp (15 mL) red pepper flakes

2 tbsp (30 mL) mustard oil (optional)

In a medium saucepan, combine the cherries and cranberries and stir.

Add the wine and bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the wine has reduced to 1 cup, about 30 minutes.

Remove from the heat, add the sugar, mustard powder, mustard seeds, and red pepper flakes and stir to dissolve the sugar. Allow to cool, then cover and let steep for 24 hours at room temperature.

Add the mustard oil (if using), stir, and transfer the mostarda to a jar. Refrigerate if not being used immediately.

Cheese sticks

These simple to make nibbles can easily stickhandle a charcuterie platter. From In A Pinch by Caren McSherry.

1 lb (500g) frozen puff pastry, thawed

1 cup (250 mL) freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese

1 tsp (5 mL) sweet smoked Spanish paprika

1 tsp (5 mL) fleur de sel

Black sesame seeds (optional)

Lay the puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch (3 mm) thickness.

Mix the grated cheese, smoked paprika, and salt together in a medium bowl. Spread over the puff. Carefully press your rolling pin over the cheese, ensuring that it adheres to the pastry.

Fold the pastry in half and roll back out to the original size. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut 1/2-inch (1 cm) strips crosswise to make 24 strips. Pick up the strips, roll them in sesame seeds (if using), and twist strips to create cheese sticks.

Lay the sticks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in a preheated 400 F oven for about 15 minutes until golden brown and crisp. Let cool.

Makes 24 cheese sticks."
785|New Law Helps Working Moms - Story|"ILLINOIS - Working women who are expecting will have more rights beginning on the new year.

A new law takes effect that will require employers to make ‘reasonable accommodations’ for expectant mothers.

The Illinois General Assembly amended state law broadening the civil rights for pregnant women making it a human rights violation if a company fails to make reasonable accommodations, or forces a worker into doing something they won’t accept.

Valerie Graham, a seven months pregnant middle school teacher, thinks the new rules will help women stay safe and healthy.

""Being pregnant isn't easy,” Graham said, “So for them to provide the necessary things to help women that are pregnant and working is wonderful.""

Graham said keeping working women at work as long as possible helps them financially as well.

""As soon as I'm not working, I'm not going to have an income,” she said.

The law will allow women take more frequent breaks and avoid heavy lifting as they’re pregnancy develops.

St. John’s Hospital Prenatal Instructor Susan O’Connor said making simple changes for expectant mothers can help women immensely.

""They're fairly easy things to accommodate, but very important,” O’Connor said.

O’Connor said giving women help early makes them better employees later.

""Women are happier when those accommodations are made, they tend to stay longer with their employers, and they take less sick time because they have healthier babies,” O’Connor said.

She said keeping women working but relaxed is also best for the baby.

“It provides them to have a healthy pregnancy, that's going to take them closer to term,” O’Connor said, “We want these babies to go as close to term as possible because we know that's the best outcome for pregnancy.""

To reject a woman’s request, an employer would have to show the accommodation would place an undue hardship on ordinary operations.

788|It is our future|"First, dear reader, may I wish you a Happy New Year.



And then, let me ask: what is the most important thing to make the year happy? It can be many things, of course; such as security, livelihood, food, shelter, health and all the basic things that human beings need – and not all have it in a world which is again becoming more unequal. Some have so much that they don’t know how to use and spend all they have, and they become more and more separate from the rest; while others suffer because they cannot fulfil their basic needs. Rich and poor alike may lack good human relations with family, friends, neighbors, colleagues and the others we depend on in our everyday lives.

There are people, maybe all of us, regretting things we did or did not do, realizing that it is too late to redo or change what is in the past. Let us pray for forgiveness, and hope we did as well as we could under the circumstance, and also promise ourselves that we may do better in the future. Let us also forgive those who may have trespassed against us.

These are some of the important things we all reflect on when we take stock of the calendar year that ended yesterday. Today, we have a clean slate before us. The most important is that we meet the new year with optimism and confidence. Although it is not likely that it will be entirely different from last year, we will also have new opportunities and possibilities, as we have every day.

A few days ago, I had the opportunity to attend a walima wedding party in Islamabad. The groom had come back from Sweden to wed his new wife from his home country. A large group of Pakistani-Swedes had come along, as well as other Pakistanis who had studied in Sweden but had returned home, out of duty to family and country, or for other reasons. The groom’s father, my old colleague in a UN organization in Pakistan, was a proud and happy man, as all fathers and family members would be on such a day. Well, with some sadness, too, because the young couple would go to live in a far away country.

What was so interesting though, was to observe and listen to the dozen or so Pakistani-Swedes. They were not only proud of Pakistan; they were also proud of Sweden and had in a decade or less become partners in the new land. They had in them the optimism and confidence that is so essential to succeed in this world, or just do well for themselves and others.

The only woman in the Pakistani-Swedish ‘wedding delegation’ was born and bred in Sweden of Pakistani parents, visiting Pakistan for the first time to be introduced to her fiancé’s family. She was observing it all and taking part in the conversation in a reserved way, what we often think is typical for Scandinavians. She too had the confidence that they all seemed to have, and yet also modesty, knowing full well that they were just ordinary, clever, hardworking young students and professionals, having the fortune of residing in one of the world’s most advanced and equal countries. They had graduated from good Pakistani and Swedish universities, including the prestigious Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, ranked amongst the best in the world.

Sweden balances the local with the international, with about twenty percent of the close to ten million citizens being immigrants. In spite of a new right-wing party, with xenophobic tendencies, 80-90 percent of the Swedes from right to left are all positive to the immigrants and their integration in society like anyone else. “The Swedes are better than people in most countries,” one of the Pakistani-Swedes said, and he expressed worry about some Pakistanis saying that the Afghans living here should be pushed harder to return home. “I think we should learn a few lessons from Sweden,” he said. “I feel welcome there, and I am also glad to pay high taxes because I know the money is used for good schools, hospitals, and so on. They are innovative and have also managed to handle the recession very well.”

The young Pakistani-Swedes spoke about their experience in their new or second land in such positive ways that I, and my American friend who was there, who is a specialist in change and development, were impressed and puzzled too. We thought highly of their positive outlook, and their analytical ways of discussing issues. We also thought their opinions would be valid anywhere in the world – in Sweden, Pakistan, and beyond. My friend said she wondered if they were already smart and clever from home in Pakistan, or if they had learnt it in Sweden? And since I, coming from Norway, with studies in Sweden in my youth, felt that I was close to an expert on it all, I answered her question like this: they were already clever and unique, but the new land with its democratic and professional institutions must have released their potential and energized them.

Since young people have it all in them (more than those of us who are getting old), the Swedish educational and work environment can only lead to success when clever young people Pakistanis reach there. Well, unless they are unfortunate and get dragged into antisocial activities. This is also a universal lesson. And then we should add that there are many young people also at home in Pakistan who do very well. Yet, it is easier to succeed in Sweden, I believe, even for foreigners.

What can we do to borrow some of the Swedish ways of thinking, that spirit that the Pakistani-Swedes at the wedding party in Islamabad had?

We can do many things, and the most important is to tell every young man and woman: you can make it; you are clever, innovative and smart; do your best and play fair! That will lead to the most important quality that every youth needs: self-confidence. Not to become over-confident, not to be arrogant, just to develop a feeling of being able to make it, and that everyone would like you to succeed too. That is the basis, and most of the rest can only be made by those who walk the road, such as finding out how to cooperate with the authorities, labour unions, employers’ associations and others.

It is our future; it is our new year. We must do what we can do to make it the way we want it to be. We can learn from Sweden – and from the Pakistani-Swedes at the wedding party. Yet, we also know that the road must be made by those who walk it, where they are. The rest of us should do what we can to the help the young find their way and embark on their journey, so they may all have many happy new years.

By FOX 47 News. CREATED Dec 31, 2014

A Texas man has been arraigned on several weapons, stalking and indecent exposure charges for allegedly accosting a teenager girl in Isabella County.

27-year-old Glen Timberlake from Austin is accused of having online conversations and text messages of a sexual nature for two years with a girl who is now 14.

The county sheriff says Timberlake also sent her four indecent exposure videos of himself.

He was caught in Michigan last weekend.

The sheriff's office says he was carrying a large knife because he ""wanted some answers.""

791|New York gets ready for New Year's Eve celebration|"The glittering 11,875-pound ball was tested Tuesday ahead of the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, where up to a million revelers are expected to ring in 2015. Workers coiled massive cables as the ball went up and down the flagpole atop 1 Times Square.

""It was such a difficult 2014, we're going to have a great celebration to ring in the new year,"" said Jeffrey Straus, president of the Times Square Alliance, which runs the event. ""This is our opportunity to come together to celebrate the future.""

Ryan Seacrest will host the countdown show, with Taylor Swift, Idina Menzel, Florida Georgia Line and Magic! among the musical guests. When the clock strikes midnight and the ball drops, so will 1 ton of confetti — scraps of paper containing well wishes for the upcoming year.

The ball drop idea is being modeled around the country — Las Cruces, New Mexico, is holding a chile drop for the first time. Atlanta and Nashville, Tennessee, are hosting peach and music note drops.

In Boston, the mayor and police commissioner urged activists to hold off on a planned ""die-in"" protesting police violence during the city's annual festivities. Mayor Martin Walsh and Police Commissioner William Evans suggested the family-friendly First Night event is not the proper venue to address recent police killings of unarmed black men and boys in the U.S.

No major protests were planned in New York, where the police department is still mourning two officers shot to death in a patrol car on Dec. 20 by a man who vowed online to kill ""pigs."" But security will be tight. NYPD Chief of Department James O'Neill said that though there were no known threats against the city or its officers, the department has added even more personnel.

""We're absolutely concerned about the security of everyone there, including the police officers,"" O'Neill said.

If any anti-police protesters show up, they will be allowed in — but they would have to arrive early because eager merrymakers often wait 10 hours or more to get a good spot to view the show. That also means staying put behind metal pens. There are no bathrooms and once people leave, they can't come back to their spot. Police check backpacks. No alcohol is allowed.

Each year, the police department assigns thousands of extra patrol officers to the festivities to control the crowd and watch for any signs of trouble. Visitors will see heavily armed counterterrorism teams and bomb-sniffing dogs. Rooftop patrols and NYPD helicopters will keep an eye on the crowd, and plainclothes officers will blend in with revelers. Newly graduated officers will take part.

""Times Square is probably the safest place in New York City on New Year's Eve,"" O'Neill said.

The bomb squad and a unit specializing in chemical and biological threats will sweep hotels, theaters, construction sites and parking garages. They also will patrol the Times Square subway station and certain exits will be blocked off. The NYPD will rely on a network of thousands of closed-circuit security cameras blanketing lower Manhattan, parts of midtown Manhattan and the subway system.

After the show, sanitation crews will get to work cleaning up from the celebration, working through the night to rid the area of an estimated 50 tons of garbage including confetti, party hats and other leftovers from the revelry.

792|Greek PM Links Elections, Nation's Eurozone Future|"Greek PM Links Elections, Nation's Eurozone Future

VoA - News Wednesday 31st December, 2014

Greece's prime minister is warning that his financially battered country may be forced out of the eurozone monetary union if leftists promising to scrap wide-ranging austerity measures are victorious in snap elections next month.

Antonis Samaras spoke Tuesday, shortly after formally asking the country's outgoing president to dissolve parliament ahead of polls set for January 25.

Greece was forced into early elections after lawmakers failed Monday to endorse the government's candidate for president in a third and final round of voting. Fears of a Greek exit from the 18-nation eurozone already have rattled investors and markets in European capitals.

The opposition Syriza party said it wanted to renegotiate terms of nearly $300 billion in bailouts fronted since 2010 by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

Late Monday, the IMF said it was suspending loan installments until a new government was in place.

Syriza leaders said they would stop repaying the debt unless the so-called troika agreed to relax terms of the bailout, including austerity measures that have brought devastating hardships to millions of Greek citizens.

Recent opinion polls have shown Syriza leading Samaras' ruling coalition by 3 to 6 percentage points."

Duluth norovirus outbreak traced to vegetables served at parties

DULUTH, Minn. - An outbreak of norovirus at downtown Duluth’s Tycoons Alehouse & Eatery has been traced to uncooked vegetables served at three holiday parties on Dec. 5.

The Minnesota Department of Health has been investigating the outbreak of norovirus — which is not food poisoning per se, but rather a virus that is passed from one infected person to others, in this case through contact with food.

In this case, someone on the food prep staff at Tycoons was infected and apparently came in contact with the raw vegetables served to customers at the three separate parties, said Brad Nelson, marketing director for the Duluth-based company that owns Tycoons and other eating establishments in town.

About 30 people reported becoming ill from the outbreak."
794|Verso settles with Department of Justice regarding NewPage acquisition|"Verso Paper Corp. has reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice that will permit Verso to proceed with its acquisition of NewPage Holdings Inc.

This $1.4 billion transaction was originally announced on January 6, 2014. Once the acquisition is complete, Verso will have approximately $3.5 billion in annual sales and approximately 5,800 employees in eight mills across six states.

As part of the settlement process, the United States filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court alleging that Verso's proposed acquisition of NewPage would violate the antitrust laws. At the same time, the United States filed a proposed settlement that, if approved, will resolve the lawsuit and enable the transaction to proceed. This proposed settlement requires the divestiture of NewPage's paper mills in Biron, Wisconsin and Rumford, Maine.

The acquisition is expected to be completed in early January 2015.

""The combination of Verso and NewPage will create a stronger, more stable company that will be better positioned to serve our customers and compete in a competitive global marketplace,"" said David J. Paterson, Verso's president and chief executive officer. ""We are pleased that we were able to address the concerns of the Justice Department while preserving the benefits of the transaction for our stockholders and customers.""

""Although this transaction has been among the most challenging and complex, the resulting combination will create value for all of our constituents, particularly our shareholders,"" said Mark Angelson, the chairman of NewPage. ""We would not have come this far without critical input from the Justice Department and the advisors, key shareholders and directors of both companies.""

795|Search for missing passenger jet resumes|"SURABAYA, Indonesia – The search for a missing AirAsia jet carrying 162 people that disappeared on a flight from Indonesia to Singapore resumed with first light Monday.

First Admiral Sigit Setiayana, the Naval Aviation Center commander at the Surabaya air force base, said that 12 navy ships, five planes, three helicopters and a number of warships were taking part, along with ships and planes from Singapore and Malaysia. The Australian Air Force also sent a search plane.

Setiaya said visibility was good.

“God willing, we can find it soon,” he told The Associated Press.

AirAsia Flight 8501 vanished in airspace thick with storm clouds on its way from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore. Searchers had to fight against heavy rain Sunday before work was suspended because of darkness.

The plane’s disappearance and suspected crash caps an astonishingly tragic year for air travel in Southeast Asia. The Malaysia-based carrier’s loss comes on top of the still-unexplained disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over Ukraine.

At the Surabaya airport, passengers’ relatives pored over the plane’s manifest, crying and embracing. Nias Adityas, a housewife from Surabaya, was overcome with grief when she found the name of her husband, Nanang Priowidodo, on the list.

The 43-year-old tour agent had been taking a family of four on a trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia’s Lombok island, and had been happy to get the work.

“He just told me, ‘Praise God, this new year brings a lot of good fortune,”’ Adityas recalled, holding her grandson tight while weeping uncontrollably.

Nearly all the passengers and crew are Indonesians, who are frequent visitors to Singapore, particularly on holidays.

The Airbus A320 took off Sunday morning from Indonesia’s second-largest city and was about halfway to Singapore when it vanished from radar. The jet had been airborne for about 42 minutes.

There was no distress signal from the twin-engine, single-aisle plane, said Djoko Murjatmodjo, Indonesia’s acting director general of transportation."
796|A Son Is Lost Without His Mother. So Is A Country|"She is one of the African health workers who caught Ebola and died. Dr. Ameyo Adadevoh was the head of First Consultants Medical Centre in Lagos, Nigeria. In July, Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer flew sick to the city from Monrovia, ended up at her clinic and turned out to have Ebola. He wanted to leave. Dr. Adadevoh and her team refused to let him go — if she had, he could have triggered a wide-scale epidemic in Lagos, a city of 20 million people. Instead, the outbreak was limited in Africa's most populous nation, and Nigeria was declared Ebola-free in October by the World Health Organization.

Adadevoh's only child, Bankole Cardoso, returned to Nigeria last year from the U.S. He had studied at Boston College, then worked in New York in financial services. But he missed his extended family, so he returned home to Nigeria and started a taxi service, EasyTaxi.

Cardoso, who turned 26 while his mother was fighting Ebola, shared his thoughts about her life and death — and her legacy.

How did Ebola come into your life?

Once the Liberian national came into Nigeria and was rushed to my mother's hospital — of course this was the first time Nigeria had ever had Ebola.

When you say your mother's hospital — Dr. Ameyo Adadevoh was the chief doctor at First Consultants Medical Centre in Lagos.

Yes, she was there for 21 years. That's where I was born, that's where all my cousins were born, my friends were born. So many people go to that hospital because of her. She's synonymous with First Consultants Hospital.

Upon seeing the patient, she was told that he was coming from Liberia, so she immediately suspected that he may have an infectious disease, because he was being treated for malaria at the time.

And she noticed that [it] seemed as if he was bleeding on the surface of his skin. So that was the first time I ever heard her speak about Ebola.

What did she say?

All I remember her saying at the time — this was just her nature, never about herself — just I remember what she was saying was that he seemed scared, the patient. And so she was praying for him and telling him everything will be fine.

Just like her normal self, as you would hear from anyone in Nigeria that has come across her, that she is completely selfless. She gives her all to all her patients. When someone is ill, she is happy to do an in-house call, she's happy to do anything to make sure they're fine.

Beyond the medicine, she was always there for people

I remember her being so affected that he was so scared and worried about himself, when she had to tell him that she believes he has an infectious disease.

Later on, I found out that when he was told he had an infectious disease, he went bananas, he was furious, and he demanded to be released from the hospital.

At that point, and this I know as well, the Liberian government was calling her and pressuring her to release him, that he had come for an important meeting, an international conference in Calabar — in the eastern part of Nigeria.

So they demanded for him to be released, citing that he was kidnapped by the hospital and that it's against his human rights to keep him there.

They threatened her multiple times. She stood her ground. There was no way to let him go because he was putting the rest of Nigeria at risk if he left the hospital.

By now your mother knew he had Ebola?

On the Monday I believe they did the test. By the Tuesday or Wednesday it was confirmed.

I remember her being preoccupied the whole time, with this on her mind that she has an Ebola patient ...

That there's no Ebola treatment unit?

Precisely, and at the time there were messages going around Nigeria — avoid First Consultants Hospital, avoid Obalende — which is the area the hospital's in — because there's an Ebola patient there.

She was concerned that the image and reputation of her hospital was being really damaged.

The Liberian-American, Patrick Sawyer, died. Your mother then had to face a 21-day incubation period during which she could develop Ebola.

When she fell ill herself, it was more my dad noticing. Normally she's an extremely active person. But one Saturday she seemed to be just taking her time, not really her normal self.

So he suspected and we spoke, and she says she feels OK. When she didn't go to work on Monday and Tuesday is when she started to feel ill.

She didn't want to go into the isolation unit. Because when the Liberian national was at her hospital, I remember she used the world ""uninhabitable."" That that place was uninhabitable [the isolation unit that was being made ready by the health authorities].

Eventually, two days later, an ambulance came and we went to the isolation unit. The WHO doctor said he has dealt with hundreds of Ebola patients. In every five, two walk away, two have to be managed, one dies.

And so he said that, in this condition, where he was working with bare health bones, understaffed, he was really battling and it's going to be a tough situation.

Then the doctor was speaking to her, and after, he told us he suspects she has this disease. Of course at that point, I completely lost it, but I spoke to her and she was like, ""Do not worry, this thing is not going to kill me.""

Was her morale low?

This is someone whose morale is never low. Even then her morale was not low. She is such a fighter.

How was she responding in those first days?

Suddenly, every day seemed to be getting worse and worse, so [the doctor] told us to prepare ourselves for what was to come.

Five days later, she was still there. And things seemed to be getting better, perhaps. And [the doctor], for the first time he had something to say — maybe it could be neurological damage at the end of the day.

This was probably day eight or nine. This was my birthday.

The next day, we come expecting some more positive news, and that day the story just changes. He says it will be a matter of time.

Until you lost your mother?

Yes.

Were you able to digest that?

Of course not. My dad was able to comfort me, but I was lost completely.

Losing a mother is tough in any circumstances, but losing her after she had tried to fight for the life of a patient suffering from Ebola, losing her to Ebola — that must have been devastating.

Yes, completely. Devastating doesn't come close or even cover it.

What were you thinking?

Anger, confusion — they're probably the two most forceful feelings I had.

The fact that your mother is hailed as a hero — does that help?

It was difficult at the beginning as we began to grieve. Her picture was everywhere, in the newspapers, on television, on social media. But now it helps in the sense that people are offering genuine support. This came from our nucleus of family and friends to begin with. But then after that, it has become even bigger. And so, I was comforted by people I know and now I'm being comforted by people I don't even know.

What do they say about your mother?

That your mother was great, she did this for our country. She really made a difference — an impact. She's a heroine.

That's what's intriguing to me now, to hear different stories from different people. [They say] ""she treated my grandfather, she treated my mother, she treated me, she treated my children. She treated four generations of our family"". And you hear that from so many different people. That all helps.

How old was your mother?

She was 57. A lot of people that knew her — her patients and those that knew her outside of the hospital — were very surprised. They thought she was 40 or something. She had a very young personality. She took care of herself. She was too young. Fifty-seven.

And you must be thinking, I'm glad I came home, back home to Nigeria?

Things happen in mysterious ways, right? There I was in New York, comfortable. No reason really to come back.

But there was this feeling inside me that I wanted to be home because of the family. That's where I belong. Thank God I did come back. But also, at times, I think if I was there, she would have visited me or maybe she wouldn't have been here.

Is it lonely in the house without your mother?

It's definitely not the same. Every household connected to our family feels the same. There's just something missing. Because, like I mentioned, she was this special bond between every single one of us. She just had this special relationship with everybody.

How will you memorialize your mother?

We have set up a health trust fund in her name — Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh. www.drasatrust.org

It's a health fund set up to improve the Nigerian healthcare system by working with institutions on a community level and by improving healthcare across Nigeria.

Because the national health infrastructure is poor.

Exactly and also because that is what she loved to do. She was in healthcare her whole life. Her father was a doctor, a professor. He opened the Infectious Diseases hospital in Nigeria which is where my mother passed.

He was a renowned doctor as well. Her family is full of doctors. This is what she loved to do. She could be on holiday — anywhere, but she still attended to patients. She would do anything for patients.

So to memorialize her, we want to continue impacting healthcare in Nigeria — giving people trust and faith in Nigerian healthcare.

What kind of projects will you take on?

Still in discussion phase — healthcare system, infectious diseases, education. Focusing on those main areas.

We've already received some Hazmat suits to distribute to Nigerian hospitals.

The protective gear that those who are fighting Ebola wear, to keep safe.

Even other infectious diseases. It's important that Nigeria be prepared for all infectious diseases.

Nigeria often gets a very bad press: Boko Haram, the missing kidnapped schoolgirls, complaints that Nigeria should be superrich with its oil wealth and yet people are so poor, because of corruption. But on this first case of Ebola in Nigeria, your country is earning plaudits from all over the world for stopping the virus.

Exactly. I read somewhere that Nigeria was ranked 107th out of 109 countries in terms of healthcare, by the WHO, in 2000. So the fact that we beat this is definitely something that we had no divine right to do. I think people are shocked that Nigeria could pull off something like that.

This has shown that, within our own country we can take control. We didn't need, really, outside help out of this situation. I really believe my generation is inspired by that.

Your mother would be pleased to hear that.

She will be. The last thing she said to me was that she was proud of me. I feel still incredibly connected to her, despite the fact that she's not here.

So she's continuing to inspire you?

Definitely. Absolutely. It's strange because, of course, there are times where I feel that she's still around. But then I'm like, ""Don't be silly"". But there are really times when I feel she is working her magic how she used to do.

Did your mother discuss with you how she may have become infected with Ebola?

There have been different theories that I heard from the hospital. That she touched an [intravenous fluid] drip bag. I read in places that she had pushed the man — but that's not true, because my mum was small and he was a big guy!

She always maintained that she never had contact with him directly. So she claimed that it was a mystery how she got this.

Was faith a part of Dr. Adadevoh's life?

Hugely a part of my mother's life and mine through her. She was an incredibly spiritual person. Her faith was incredibly strong. And so we'd go to church together and things like that.

She would actually call in priests and pastors to pay last rites to her patients that were not going to make it. And she had such a strong belief. Her last words were ""Blood of Jesus,"" according to the doctor.

You say she was incredibly energetic and always up and about. Do you think she gave up?

Absolutely not. The doctors — they kept saying she is a fighter, so she's going to pull through. Giving up — it just doesn't exist for her.

797|Matching Two Misfits|"The U.S. Air Force has successfully tested the new JMMBRU bomb rack for the SDB (Small Diameter Bomb). JMMBRU allows the F-35 to carry eight SDBs internally, plus (in a less stealthy configuration) another 16 externally. This makes the F-35 a much more effective bomber, especially since the SDB has been upgraded. The air force recently completed tests of SBD II (130 kg/285 pound, also known as the GBU-39/B). This model is equipped with hardware and software to enable it to hit moving targets. The SBD II is now ready for mass production.

The problem is that there is not a lot of demand for the SDB II and not a lot will be ordered. This despite the fact that SDB II can hit vehicles going at high speed and in bad weather. SDB II has an encrypted data link that enables the F-36 pilot to guide the SDB, with great precision, to hit moving targets. This communications capability enables the SDB movement to be controlled via the air force's airborne Internet (Link 16), which means the “bomb driver” can be anywhere, even another aircraft or on the ground. The SDB II has three different guidance systems: radar, heat seeker, and homing on laser light bounced off the target. That means no matter what the weather or time of day there is a guidance system that will find the target. Even without human intervention the three sensors enable SDB II to find targets in a cluttered and obscured (by weather or darkness) environment.

The SDB is basically an unpowered missile which can glide long distances. This makes the SDB even more compact, capable, and expensive (about $70,000 for SDB I and four times that for SDB II). The small wings allow the SDB to glide up to 70-80 kilometers (from high altitude). SDB also has a hard front end that can punch through nearly three meters (eight feet) of rock or concrete and a warhead that does less damage than the usual dumb bomb (explosives in a metal casing). That’s because SDB carries only 17 kg (38 pounds) of explosives, compared to 127 kg (280 pounds) in the 500 pound bomb. The SDB is, thus, the next generation of smart bombs and the more compact design allows more to be carried. Thus, F-15/16/18 type aircraft can carry 24 or more SDBs. The SDBs are carried on a special carriage which holds 4 of them instead of one bomb of more traditional shape. The carriage is mounted on a bomber just like a single larger (500, 1,000, or 2,000) pound bomb would be. However, this feature was rarely needed in combat situations because one smart bomb does the work of hundreds of unguided ones. There are also a lot of other guided weapons out there. JMMBRU was designed to fit in the internal bomb bay of the F-35.

As effective as the SDB is it must operate in a very competitive environment. The U.S. has several long range guided bombs as well as cruise missiles for this sort of thing. The long range bombs include the JASSM and JSOW, which are both basically GPS guided smart bombs. The original JDAM bomb kit (added to 500, 1,000, and 2,000 pound bombs) cost $26,000 each. The longer range JSOW (JDAM with wings and more powerful guidance system) cost $460,000 each. The even longer range JASSM cost $500,000 (the 400 kilometer version) to $930,000 (the 900 kilometer JASSM ER) each. The AGM-158 JASSM missiles are 1,045 kg (2,300 pound) weapons that are basically 455 kg (1,000 pound) JDAMS (GPS guided bombs) with a motor added. JASSM was designed to go after enemy air defense systems or targets deep in heavily defended (against air attack) enemy territory. The reason for buying these is to have something to deal with air defenses of a nation like China.

Finally, there’s the new Tomahawk. The RGM-109E Block IV Surface Ship Vertical Launched Tomahawk Land Attack Missile weighs 1.2 tons, is 6 meters (18 feet) long, has a range of 1,600 kilometers, getting to the target at a speed of 600-900 kilometers an hour, flying at an altitude of 17-32 meters (50-100 feet), and propelled by a jet engine generating only 600 pounds of thrust. Accuracy is on a par with JDAM (10 meters/ 31 feet). The Block IV Tomahawk can be reprogrammed in flight to hit another target and carries a vidcam to allow a missile to check on prospective targets. There’s also the new JMEW (Joint Multi-Effects Warhead System) warhead for the Tomahawk. This is a 450 kg (1,000 pound) warhead designed mainly for penetrating underground bunkers, but it will also provide excellent blast effect for less robust targets. JMEW uses laser terminal guidance, enabling it to hit within a few meters (ten feet) of its aiming point. JMEW can also hit moving targets.

The 130 kg SDB more often finds itself competing with smaller weapons like the 49 kg Hellfire missile rather than with the larger smart bombs and missiles. But all these smaller weapons have precision in common and the SDB is the only one of the “smart bombs” that can go after moving targets on land or sea. One problem with this, and the SDB in general, is that smaller guided missiles, especially Hellfire, are still the preferred weapon for this sort of thing. The problem for the air force is they don’t have a small weapon like Hellfire for their jets. Britain does (Brimstone, a version of Hellfire tweaked to work on fast aircraft) and now the U.S. Air Force has the smaller 70mm guided missile that will work on jets. So far SDB has been an excellent weapon in search of a mission that isn’t already being taken care of by something that gets it done and has been around longer.

Meanwhile a lot of controversy surrounds the F-35. The U.S. Air Force still expects to get production models of its 31 ton F-35A in late 2016. This is the cheapest version, costing about $159 million each. The U.S. Navy version (the F-35C) will arrive in late 2019 and cost about $264 million each. This version has a stronger landing gear to handle carrier landings and components that are more resistant to corrosion from constant exposure to salt water. The vertical take-off version for the marines, the F-35B, will cost $214 million each. All of these prices are expected to be much higher (20 percent or more) in reality. This is happening despite more and more delays as well as questions about reliability and cost. At the moment the F-35 costs 60 percent more (than the F-16, per flight hour) to operate.

The F-35 is armed with an internal 25mm cannon and, before the SDB, four internal air-to-air missiles (or two missiles and two smart bombs) plus four external smart bombs and two missiles. All sensors are carried internally and max weapon load is 6.8 tons. The aircraft is very stealthy when just carrying internal weapons.

Like the F-22 fighter, the F-35 is stealthy and stuffed with a lot of new technology. Most (about 60 percent) of the F-35s built will be used by foreign nations. The rising cost of the F-35 brings with it reluctance to buy as many aircraft as currently planned. The success of smart bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan has also made it clear that fewer aircraft will be needed in the future. In any event, it's likely that F-35s will end up costing more than $100 million each. But with SBDs F-35s become a very potent bomber that can get at well protected targets."
798|Abbas signs bid to join ICC|"RAMALLAH (AFP) -- President Mahmoud Abbas Wednesday signed a Palestinian request to join the International Criminal Court, seeking a new avenue for action against Israel after a failed UN resolution on ending the occupation.

The Palestinian leadership hopes ICC membership will pave the way for war crimes prosecutions against Israeli officials for their actions in the occupied territories.

But Israel said Palestinian crimes would be exposed to the judgement of the Hague-based court if Palestine joined.

Tuesday's vote at the Security Council came after a three-month Palestinian campaign to win support for a resolution that would have set a timeframe for ending the Israeli occupation.

Israel hailed the rejection as a victory, saying it dealt a blow to Palestinian efforts to diplomatically ""embarrass and isolate"" Israel.

The Palestinians denounced as ""outrageously shameful"" the failure of the text to win the necessary nine votes for passage.

The resolution would have set a 12-month deadline for Israel to reach a final peace deal with the Palestinians and called for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Palestinian territories by the end of 2017.

Council heavyweights China, France, and Russia were among eight countries voting in favor, while the United States and Australia voted against.

Nigeria, which had been expected to support the resolution, was among five abstentions, which included Britain, Rwanda, Lithuania, and South Korea.

Nigeria had assured the Palestinians it would support them, but abstained after lobbying efforts by Israel and Washington.

The failure to win the nine votes necessary for adoption spared Washington having to wield its veto, which would have caused it embarrassment with key Arab allies.

But it was also a diplomatic blow for the Palestinians, who had counted on the symbolic victory of nine votes, even though the resolution would in all likelihood have vetoed by the United States.

Speaking Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended his special thanks to Nigeria and Rwanda.

""This is what tipped the scales,"" he said.

Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said ""the failure of the Palestinian vote at the Security Council should teach the Palestinians that provocations and attempts to force Israel into unilateral processes will not achieve anything -- quite the opposite.""

But Russia said the council's failure to pass the resolution was ""a strategic error.""

Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi expressed regret over the outcome, criticizing the African nations that abstained and pledging to continue ""intensive Arab diplomatic activity"" in support of the Palestinian cause.

The Palestinians reacted furiously to the vote and pledged to press ahead immediately with an application for ICC membership.

""The UN Security Council vote is outrageously shameful,"" said senior PLO official Hanan Ashrawi.

""Those countries that abstained demonstrated a lack of political will to hold Israel accountable and to act in accordance with the global rule of law and international humanitarian law.

The Islamist movement Hamas blamed Abbas for the setback, demanding he make good on threats to cut security cooperation with Israel and join the ICC.

""He is now facing two choices after this failure ... he must make good on his threats to end security cooperation with the occupier, and sign the Rome Statute,"" spokesman Fawzi Barhum told AFP, referring to the court's founding treaty.

Senior officials said Abbas would sign the Rome Statute later Wednesday, along with 15 other international conventions, in a move that would be discussed with the leadership at 6:30 p.m.

The ICC can prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, and Palestinian plans to become a party to the court have been strongly opposed by Israel and the United States.

Israel warned that joining the court would also expose Palestinians to prosecution.

""The Palestinians will themselves be judged by this court, which will show the world the nature of Palestinian terrorism and the war crimes committed in the name of the Palestinian Authority,"" foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon told AFP."

800|Man kills 8 people in Canada before taking own life|"A man with a lengthy criminal record killed six adults and two young children before taking his own life in Edmonton, Alberta, in what the police chief on Tuesday called the city’s worst mass murder.

Edmonton Police Chief Rod Knecht told a news conference late on Tuesday night that there was no suggestion of gang involvement and said the motive for the “senseless mass murder” appears to have been “planned and deliberate” domestic violence.

Mr. Knecht did not release the name of the suspect, but said the man was well-known to police and had a criminal record dating back to September 1987. Cindy Duong, 37, was fatally shot in a home in south Edmonton on Monday, while two men and three women between the ages of 25 and 50, and a girl and a boy both under the age of 10 were found dead a few hours later at a home in the northeast.

Investigators have determined the 9 mm handgun used to kill Duong was a registered weapon that had been stolen in Surrey, British Columbia, in 2006. The suspect was found dead by his own hand in a restaurant in the Edmonton bedroom community of Fort Saskatchewan on Tuesday morning.

Autopsies will be conducted on Thursday.

Duong’s body was found around 7 p.m. on Monday when police responded to a report of a man entering the south-side home, opening fire and fleeing, Mr. Knecht said. Investigators have determined the 9 mm handgun used to kill Duong had been stolen in Surrey, British Columbia, in 2006.

An hour and a half later, officers responded to reports of a suicidal man at a northeast residence in a quiet cul-de-sac, the same home where the suspect had been arrested in November 2012 and charged with domestic and sexual assault. Family members reported in the call that the man was “depressed and over-emotional.”

When officers arrived, no one answered the door, Mr. Knecht said. They searched the exterior of the home but found nothing overtly suspicious and did not go inside.

“We can’t just arbitrarily go into that residence,” explained the chief. Neighbour Moe Assiff said he saw officers come out and talk to a woman sitting with a man in a white car outside the house.

“She just let out a hysterical scream. It was eerie,” Mr. Assiff said. “She was screaming about her kids- ‘My kids! The kids!,’ grabbing her hair and trying to pull her hair out. The cops then ushered her down the road into a police cruiser.”

The suspect’s body was found hours later at the VN Express Asian restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan after police brought in tactical-team officers, surrounded the area and reportedly smashed through the front of the restaurant with a vehicle.

Mr. Knecht said the suspect had a business interest in the restaurant, but would not say if he was the owner.

Outside the restaurant, police found a parked black SUV that they say was seen near the location of the first shooting is southwest Edmonton.

Alberta Premier Jim Prentice said in a statement that he trusts the police investigation will provide answers as people struggle to understand what happened.

“In this season of peace and goodwill, this act of violence is all the more difficult to comprehend. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those involved at this very difficult time. May they find strength in knowing that Albertans share in their loss.”

At their game on Tuesday night, the Edmonton Oilers paused for a moment of silence out of respect for the victims.

In Edmonton, a city of 878,000 people, mass murders are extremely rare. Mr. Knecht said the case was the worst mass killing in the city since at least 1956, when six people were murdered.

John Etter Clark, a provincial politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for four years, killed his wife, son, three daughters and an employee of their family farm before taking his own life in 1956. Mr. Clark had been suffering from frequent nervous breakdowns in the years before the killings."
801|Modi meets Nirbhaya's parents, says govt doing utmost for safety of women|"December 31, 2014 19:08 IST

The parents of the December 16 Delhi gang rape victim on Wednesday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The prime minister condoled their loss and assured the parents that the union government would do its utmost for the safety and security of women.

The prime minister also appreciated the efforts of the girl's mother, who now runs the Nirbhaya Jyoti Trust, for the security and welfare of women, a statement from the Prime

Minister's Office said.

Two years ago, the 23-year-old paramedical student and her male friend were attacked by six men on December 16, 2012 after they got on a private bus while going home from the cinema. Her friend was battered with an iron rod, which was later used to torture her. The couple was then thrown from the bus. The woman succumbed to her injuries 13 days later at a Singapore hospital.

Last September, four of her attackers were convicted after the case was fast-tracked, while a juvenile was sentenced to three years in a detention centre. Ram Singh, who is the sixth accused in this case, was found dead in jail in March last year.

803|VIEWPOINT: Viable city, promising future|"As the city of South Bend prepares to celebrate its sesquicentennial in 2015 (150 years!), it is important to acknowledge that, like many cities across America, we have faced challenges. Not only have we survived, but many times we have come out better because of it. In spite of the most recent economic downturn, the city continues to evolve and reinvent itself to bring about a viable and promising future.

To paraphrase the SB150 webpage: hard work, strong leadership, creativity, and determination have built this city, and I am confident that there is much more to come.

As I reflect upon 2014, I am reminded that cities are about people and the quality of life for their citizens.

As Irving Wladawsky-Berger, chairman emeritus of the IBM Academy of Technology, wrote in his article:

What are the key qualities of a great city? “Excellent public infrastructures and services are essential for a good city, but they are not sufficient. A truly great city needs to be an appealing place to live. It needs to attract and retain a large pool of local, national and international talent.”

So, those qualities referenced by Wladawsky-Berger contribute to making what is known as a livable city. You are surely aware that in the not-too-distant past, South Bend was called a “dying” and “unhappy” city. But those of us who live and work in, or love this city, see a better city, a city with a viable and promising future.

How can I write that with any confidence? Simply put, because great things have been happening here, and more great things are going to happen here.

In 2014, the city approved 23 major economic development projects that will bring new jobs. A six-part collaboration will bring some of the most advanced aerospace testing facilities in the world via ND Turbo, and to where? To South Bend!

Some would say that high-tech jobs are fine, but what about manufacturing? Area employers asked, and a local program, SMART, (Supporting Manufacturers & Regional Talent), provided scholarships and customized training to employ new people, and to improve the job skills of currently employed citizens.

Do you want to live in a livable city … one that attracts and keeps hard-working and contributing citizens?

Of course you do, we all do. The city is working diligently to revitalize the Lincoln Way West and Western Avenue corridors, and all the neighborhoods in between. Smart Streets improvements have been concluded, three thus far. The vacant and abandoned homes initiative has addressed 717 properties.

Citizens, via their neighborhood associations, shared their concerns about inadequate lighting and the negative impact on public safety. We listened and through a collaboration with city administration, AEP, and the Common Council, “Light Up South Bend” was born. Two neighborhoods benefited with extra lighting, and in the upcoming year, other districts will benefit from the collaboration.

How do we help our citizens and our neighborhoods thrive? We have active and engaged partners in higher education, right here in our community. Our city continues to benefit from our educational institutions. Their positive impacts cannot be overstated.

In spite of these many accomplishments we, like many cities in our country, have issues of social and racial disparity. In 2015 we must find a way to address the inequities in our community, especially in the areas of housing, employment and education. This cannot be done in isolation. The question of whether the South Bend Police Department tapes should be heard or not has polarized this community. A decision must be made so our city can move forward; otherwise, this remains a point of contention and debate among our citizens.

What’s ahead in 2015? We must not only continue the great work begun in 2014, but also expand these works. For example, more of our citizens will benefit from the collective efforts of the council and city administrations through the Curb & Sidewalks Program. Diversifying our public safety departments will have a positive impact upon our citizens and improve communication.

Further, we must draw our educational institutions, business and manufacturing leaders and our everyday citizens into those difficult discussions and address those well-known and entrenched social, educational, economic and racial disparities. Together we must develop a collective strategy that our community can embrace, and then we must do the work. Be prepared to join the celebration: South Bend 150. We are celebrating the past and preparing for a bright future!

Karen White is an at-large member of the South Bend Common Council."

807|United Airlines and Orbitz Sue 22-Year-Old Entrepreneur for Promoting “Hidden City” Fares : US News : Latin Post|"Aktarer Zaman, 22, who founded airfare search engine Skiplagged.com last year, is being sued by United Airlines and Orbitz for helping travelers find the least expensive airfare using ""hidden city"" fares. (Photo : Aktarer.com)

United Airlines and travel-booking service Orbitz are suing Skiplagged, a small startup that helps travelers breach the airlines' pricing schemes to acquire better deals by finding ""hidden city"" fares, reports TechCrunch.



In November, United Airline and Orbitz filed a civil lawsuit against 22-year-old Aktarer Zaman, who founded Skiplagged.com last year. The two companies allege that Zaman used the website to ""intentionally and maliciously interfere with [their] contracts and business relations in the airline industry [...]"" and ""by promoting prohibited forms of travel on Skiplagged, Zaman has induced breach of Orbitz Worldwide's travel agency contracts with commercial airlines and of United's customer contractual relationships.""



Airline pricing is complex and confusing. It is often less expensive to buy a ticket from Philadelphia to Orlando with a stopover in Chicago even though you just want to go to Chicago. You simply remain in Chicago instead of taking the next flight segment to Orlando. As strange as it may sound, sometimes it is cheaper to buy a ticket for a multi-leg flight rather than a regular one-way ticket.

By the way, it only works when you do not check luggage.



The airline industry calls this a ""hidden ticket"" fare. Most airlines ban the practice.



It is against airline rules to book flights with the intent to not fly to the ticket's final destination, but savvy fliers have used this strategy to obtain better fares. United Airlines specifically prohibits this practice in its Contract of Carriage, and the consequences include charging you the regular fare, deleting your frequent flier miles and taking legal action.



According to Zaman's post on Reddit, Skiplagged.com was launched last year as an airfare search engine capable of finding hidden-city opportunities and ways to combine two one-ways for cheaper than round-trip costs. Zaman claims to save consumers up to 80 percent when compared with the cheapest findings on other sites, like KAYAK.

808|Big Gains and Bad Losses|"THE year 2014 started on a sad note for the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The party opened the year with the forced resignation of its national chairman, Alhaji Bamanga Tukur following some irreconcilable differences among stakeholders especially governors elected on the platform of the party.

The resignation of Tukur on January 15, 2014 was a problem carried over from the first days Tukur became national chairman in 2012 mainly carved by perceptions of arrogance and a determination to whittle down the influence of the governors.

In the wake of the problems in the party Governors Aliyu Wamakko (Sokoto), Ahmed Abdulfatah (Kwara), Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso (Kano), Chibuike Amaechi (Rivers) and former Governor of Adamawa State, Murtala Nyako left the PDP for the All Progressives Congress, APC in November 2013.

Tukur's resignation

Tukur's resignation at the 63rd National Executive Committee, NEC meeting of the party opened yet another phase as the former governor of Bauchi State, Alhaji Adamu Muazu, also from Tukur's North-East, took over on January 20, 2014.

-Senate President, Senator David Mark, wife of the Vice President, Hajia Amina Sambo, Vice President Nnamadi Sambo, First Lady, Patience Jonathan and National Chairman of PDP, Alhaji Adamu Mua'zu at the PDP National Convention in Abuja.

Knowing full well that the position of a national chairman was a tight rope to walk judging from what happened to some of his predecessors, it dawned on Mu'azu that he must play the role of a bridge builder and healer of festering wounds.

Mu'azu also made no pretences on his desire to grow the membership base of the party with plans to admit all estranged members especially with the APC lurking in the corner ahead of the 2015 polls.

Gains

While the party lost members in 2013, it, however, gained a sizeable number from the APC in 2014. Among those who crossed over to the APC were some former governors including Attahiru Bafarawa of Sokoto; Ibrahim Shekarau of Kano, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff of Borno State. Also, erstwhile military governor of Lagos and Borno, Brigadier General Buba Marwa (retd); former Governor Achike Udenwa of Imo State returned to the PDP.

Udenwa returned to the PDP alongside former Senator Ifeanyi Ararume; Senator Christy Anyanwu and among the most notable defections was that of the former Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, and the 2011 Presidential candidate of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN, Mallam Nuhu Ribadu. Ribadu is now the governorship candidate of the party in Adamawa State.

The party also gained from the defection of Senator Ehigie Uzamere who refused to register with the APC and the mass defection of Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, former national vice-chairman of the defunct ACN and his associates in Edo State.

Governor Olusegun Mimiko of Ondo State who left the PDP for Labour Party (LP) returned alongside former governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel and his supporters.

Former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi after completing his term, also dumped his party, the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA for the PDP.

Losses: The party nevertheless lost some prominent officials, the most painful being Speaker Aminu Tambuwal of the House of Representatives whose exit for the first time opened the way for the opposition to have leadership of one of the two chambers of the National Assembly since the advent of democratic rule in 1999.

As a spinoff from the party primaries, the party also lost its second national chairman Senator Barnabas Gemade; former minister of state, Trade and Investment, Dr. Samuel Ortom; former governor of Oyo State, Chief Adebayo Alao- Akala, Prince Tonye Princewill to opposition parties.

Recovering Ekiti

Also in 2014, the party won the Ekiti State governorship election at the expense of the APC through its candidate, Mr. Ayodele Fayose.

However, the PDP was not lucky in Osun where its standard bearer, Senator Iyiola Omisore could not beat the incumbent and APC candidate, Rauf Aregbesola.

After a fierce battle with the APC for the Niger East Senatorial by- election following the death of a PDP senator, Dahiru Awaisu Kuta on June 12, 2014, the PDP retained the zone through Dr. Shem Zagbayi Nuhu.

Controversial primaries

Controversies arising from the primaries at all levels remained thorny issues for the PDP. Aspirants who were schemed out protested from almost all the states of the federation with letters to the national secretariat.

Some of the aggrieved aspirants have defected to other parties to pursue their aspiration.

Unlike in the past where aspirants contested for the party's presidential ticket with the incumbent helmsman, President Jonathan was given the right of first refusal after many of the party organs adopted him as the sole candidate of the party for the presidential election.

First refusal

The party's effort to drum the claim of the right of first refusal as the practise in advanced democracies was reversed after the claim was debunked by this newspaper and Dr. Umar Ardo, a party chieftain from Adamawa State who took the party to court on the issue.

Two presidential aspirants that had shown interest but were fenced out, Dr Abdul Jelil Tafawa Balewa and wife of late Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, Prof. Akasoba Duke- Abiola were eventually given the opportunity, but no one was lost on the intents and desires of the party as concerning Jonathan who was ratified as the candidate at the special national convention.

The party also at that convention ratified the appointment of Mu'azu as national chairman whose job before then had been threatened by a move to return Tukur as national chairman. For his alleged role in that affair, Tukur was slapped with a one month suspension in November."
809|'The Intercept' May Interview More People Who Refused to Talk to 'Serial'|"Serial fans have started keeping an eye on The Intercept after the publication scored a coveted interview with Jay Wilds, the key witness in Maryland's case against Adnan Syed for the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee. The reporter who interviewed Wilds, Natasha Vargas-Cooper, told the New York Observer that she may have even more people to interview, people whom Serial host Sarah Koenig never spoke with.

""It hasn't been 100% confirmed, but I do have like two more interviews of people who refused to speak with Sarah who are very big players,"" said Vargas-Cooper. ""It looks like the prosecutor is going to talk to me, and he said he wants to talk about the questions that he would have asked Adnan had he taken the stand.""

Koenig mentioned prosecutor Kevin Urick several times in the podcast and in the finale Don, Lee's boyfriend at the time of her death, even claimed the state attorney yelled at him for not making Adnan sound ""creepy"" enough. Urick, like Wilds, did not talk to Koenig for the podcast.

The Intercept is already mimicking Serial's style of releasing information a little bit at a time, ending their Jay Wilds interviews with teases for the next one. If Vargas-Cooper begins scoring interviews with people who refused to be interviewed by Koenig, it will really start to seem like Serial part two, from the prosecution's viewpoint.

Vargas-Cooper said she had never listened to Serial prior to Wilds and his lawyer reaching out to her asking her to do an interview with him. ""So I listened to Serial to see if there was something there and if it's something I wanted to get involved with, and I saw some really huge. ... I mean just some stuff that I was, like — I mean problems, and I don't mean that necessarily in the ethical sense but it was like ... If I were to come to you at The Observer and say I want to write about a case and I don't have the star witness, I don't have the victim's family, I don't have the detectives, I don't think you would run it, you know?"" Vargas-Cooper explained to Observer reporter Ken Kurson. Kurson said he absolutely would have run it, based on his assumption that Koenig made great efforts to contact these people in an attempt to conduct interviews, which he believes she did.

""Oh, totally. I don't want this to be like I am trying to blow up Sarah Koenig. I don't want to sling mud at her,"" replied Vargas-Cooper. ""She presented a very compelling story with characters who I really wanted to hear from.""

812|British Ebola nurse was checked seven times for virus|"The British Government has defended its Ebola screening programme as it has revealed the British nurse now battling the virus was checked seven times at Heathrow Airport.

Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey was then cleared to return home despite telling authorities she was feeling unwell.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says they will look into the procedures in place.

Ms Cafferkey could be given blood donations from fellow survivors including volunteer Will Pooley in a bid to overcome the deadly virus, the Government’s chief medical officer said.

The public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire is receiving specialist treatment via a quarantine tent at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

Meanwhile a health care worker in Aberdeen who fell ill following her recent return from west Africa has tested negative for the virus, the Scottish Government has confirmed.

The woman was taken ill on Monday while visiting Torridon in the Scottish Highlands and transferred to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary where she underwent tests.

A third patient from Cornwall who has also recently returned from an affected country is currently in isolation at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Treliske, Truro, undergoing tests for the virus which has swept through west Africa.

Mrs Cafferkey, who was given the all clear to return to her home despite raising concerns about her temperature, is “doing as well as can be expected in the circumstances”, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.

Chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies said the experimental drug ZMapp, which was used to treat Mr Pooley, the nurse who was the first UK citizen to contract the disease, is “not available at the moment”.

Among options of alternative treatment she said: “We do have available a small amount of convalescent plasma. Plasma is the liquid of blood and convalescent is the recovery phase.

“Will Pooley gave a donation of the plasma and the theory is as we fight off infections we make anti-bodies and if you harvest the plasma you got a source of antibodies that you can put in to someone and you’d expect it to work.

“But the cornerstone of treatment remains fluid and electrolyte treatment.”

The nurse, from Glasgow, was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to Africa by the UK Government last month and had been working with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone.

She was initially placed in isolation at a Glasgow hospital early on Monday after feeling feverish, before being transferred south on an RAF C-130 Hercules plane.

The healthcare worker had flown from Sierra Leone via Morocco to Heathrow Airport where she was considered a high risk because of the nature of her work and showed no symptoms during screening and a temperature check.

But while waiting for a connecting flight to Glasgow she raised fears about her temperature and was tested a further six times in the space of 30 minutes.

Despite her concerns, she was given the all clear and flew on to Scotland where after taking a taxi home she later developed a fever and raised the alarm.

Dame Sally Davies said questions have been raised about the airport screening procedure but insisted the screening was designed to raise public awareness about the virus and was not expected to detect every case of Ebola.

She said: “She was cleared to travel because she didn’t have Ebola symptoms including a raised temperature.

“It does raise a question whether we should be more precautionary. The risk of raised temperature when she came back appears to have been very low.

“That’s why we look at what we do all the time to see should we have been more precautionary, is it in the public’s interest? Is it in the patient’s interest?

“I doubt it would have made much difference.”

At a press conference said she was not aware of reports that Mrs Cafferkey may have attended a Christmas Day church service ahead of her return to the UK, but that a review in to how she contracted the disease will be carried out by the Department for International Development and Save the Children.

Colleague Dr Martin Deahl, who sat next to the nurse on the flight to Heathrow as they returned from five weeks in Sierra Leone, has criticised the procedures in place for testing returning health workers as “disorganised”.

The NHS said 48 volunteer health professionals remain in Sierra Leone helping the thousands of sufferers while a further 1,500 have returned or are preparing to go in stages.

Public Health England and Health Protection Scotland are continuing to trace passengers on the flights Mrs Cafferkey took back to Heathrow via Casablanca in Morocco and her onward journey to Glasgow Airport, where she arrived at about 11.30pm on Sunday on a British Airways flight.

Dr Paul Cosford, head of the Health Protection Agency, said as of Tuesday lunchtime around a third of the 133 passengers on board the flight between Morocco and the UK have been contacted while messages have been given to more than half of the 72 travelling between Heathrow and Glasgow.

They have been urged to carefully watch for symptoms of Ebola and given advice on what to do if they present with signs of the virus.

However, he stressed that even passengers who came in to contact with Mrs Cafferkey were at extremely low risk.

“Even though the risk is considered extremely low, as a precaution we are informing people who sat in the direct vicinity of the passengers by which we mean two rows adjacent, ahead and behind them to take their temperature until the 18th of January and if it is raised significantly above 37.5 degrees or they have any concerns are advised to call PHE for advice,” he said.

“That is highly precautionary and I would emphasise again that the risk remains extremely low.

“We can be confident that the risk to the public is low. Ebola cannot be spread easily.”

Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, added: “From an NHS perspective this has not taken us by surprise.

“We’ve been watching this human tragedy unfold since December 2013 and that’s given us plenty of time to prepare and in our preparations our deliberations have focused mainly on safety.

“Safety for the public, our staff and the patient.”

He added: “In terms of the Royal Free unit it is business as usual in terms of dealing with these very tricky diseases.”

Ebola is not an airborne disease and can only be contracted through contact with bodily fluids including diarrhoea, vomit and blood.

The Royal Free Hospital, a specialist infectious diseases hospital, has the capacity to treat four Ebola patients while Newcastle and Sheffield can care for one each.

Mrs Cafferkey is the second Briton to test positive and the first to do so on UK soil after nurse Mr Pooley, 29, contracted Ebola while volunteering in Sierra Leone in August before getting the all-clear following treatment at the Royal Free Hospital.

She wrote movingly about her experiences in a diary for the Scotland on Sunday newspaper, describing how she had to tell a young boy his mother had died from the virus. His father and sister also died from Ebola, she discovered.

“The sad thing is that this is a regular occurrence and we see and hear of whole families being wiped out by this awful disease,” she wrote.

About 100 people have been tested for the virus in hospitals across England this year, most of whom had visited West Africa.

Enhanced screening was rolled out at some UK airports in October, including Heathrow, with passengers having their temperature taken and completing a questionnaire asking about their current health, recent travel history and whether they had contact with Ebola patients.

Last month, official figures showed 931 people had been assessed in the weeks since the measures were introduced at Heathrow, Gatwick, Birmingham and Manchester airports, plus London St Pancras Eurostar railway station."
813|Consumer Alert: Trusted church member cons fellow parishioners out of millions|"WASHINGTON (WJLA) -- He was a trusted member of their church community, but the con artist in question used that trust to steal millions.

Parishioners, who were worried about their money asked their church pastor to look into an investment for them.

That's when Dan Hoey's investment scam involving fellow church-goers began to unravel.

""A lot of people trusted him,"" says Tammy Mayle, a U.S. Postal Inspector. ""They believed him. He lead a bible study. He pitched an investment opportunity to these same people at his church basically asking them for money.""

Friends and family gave their money to Hoey. More than 20 people put up $2 million to invest in Hoey's company, Trilliant.

""People that work for large corporations had the opportunity through their company to obtain a mortgage with a discounted rate. Also $100 from the mortgage would go to the charity of their choice, which was very enticing for the people of the church,"" says Mayle.

But there was a problem. Hoey was running a scam.

""He went on vacations. He purchased very expensive items including a $10,000 oven. These people from his church truly believed he used this money for investment purposes,"" says Mayle.

Investors began asking questions. When they didn't get answers, they went to their pastor.

""The pastor actually stepped in and created a church discipline team and counseled Hoey to try and get restitution to the individuals,"" says Mayle.

Postal inspectors say Hoey was so convincing that some parishioners refused to believe he was running a scam.

""When I was interviewing them and said, ""You are a victim of an investment scam,"" they said, ""He's part of the church. We believe he took our money and he used it in his business, but his business failed,"" "" says Mayle.

Postal inspectors say Hoey broke the law and had to be held accountable.

""We needed to convince victims, these investors, they were true victims, that it wasn't a situation of a business gone bad. He stole their money,"" says Mayle.

Dan Hoey pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud. He will be sentenced in February."
814|The Economist's list of the year's most influential economists|"Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images

To make the situation more complex, as Danny Vinik of the New Republic notes, the magazine's criteria for making the list excluded Yellen not because she's a woman, but ""by excluding all 'serving central-bank governors.' "" However, he adds, that didn't stop them from including ""five key members of the Federal Reserve,"" such as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. It is odd that the criteria was somehow just broad enough to include these men but just narrow enough to exclude Yellen. As Ben Casselman of FiveThirtyEight writes, ""There aren’t many contexts in which Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser is more influential than Yellen.""

The list does include health care economist Jonathan Gruber, whose main contribution to 2014 was having his fumbling and failed attempt at explaining the history of the Affordable Care Act's passage unearthed. Apparently the Economist decided its rankings this year would be based on, in the magazine's words, ""how much attention was paid to their utterances in the mainstream media, the blogosphere and in social media over a 90-day period up to December 11th 2014,"" meaning that it wasn't actually measuring the most influential economists of 2014 so much as the most mentioned economists of the fall. Which is a fine list, if you want to make it, but isn't what the feature advertises.

The methodology wasn't just a blunder when it comes to Yellen, either. ""Or take No. 25,"" Casselman writes, ""San Francisco Fed President John Williams, an undeniably important economist but one who apparently scored higher because The Economist’s algorithm mixed him up with a discredited conspiracy theorist who happens to share his name."""

Nine people found dead at three crime scenes in ""senseless mass murder&quot...

Nine people, including seven adults and two young children, were found dead at three separate crime scenes in what a Canadian police chief called a “senseless mass murder”.

Chief Rod Knecht told a news conference the killings in Edmonton, Alberta, were the result of domestic violence.

The victims included a woman found on Monday night by officers who were responding to a weapons complaint at a south Edmonton home.

The bodies of three more women, two men, a boy and a girl were discovered a few hours later at a home in the north-east part of the city where officers had checked on reports of a suicidal male earlier in the evening.

None of the victims was identified, but Mr Knecht said the public was not in danger.

“This series of events are not believed to be random acts,” he said. “These events do not appear to be gang-related, but rather tragic incidents of domestic violence.”

A man matching the description of the suicidal male was found dead in a restaurant in the Edmonton community of Fort Saskatchewan yesterday morning, Mr Knecht said.

“Our homicide investigators have established associations and linkages between these homicides,” he said.

Police would not elaborate on the connection between the deaths."
816|BLM extends comment period for proposed pipeline|"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The Bureau of Land Management is giving the public more time to comment on a proposed pipeline that would be capable of moving 50,000 barrels of crude oil a day.

The project by Saddle Butte Pipeline LLC would be made up of smaller pipelines that would gather oil at well pads and other points. A larger pipeline would then move the oil south to a distribution center near Interstate 40 in western New Mexico.

Experts say the San Juan Basin is on the verge of a shale-oil boom and the pipeline would ensure the oil developed as a result gets to market.

Environmentalists worry that the pipeline would open the door to at least a five-fold increase in production in the basin.

The comment period will end Jan. 30.

819|Where are the President’s men?|"— Written by Aloy Ejimakor —

As APC continues its relentless onslaught on Jonathan and his administration, there is this telling near-silence from the ranks of PDP and others that bear the most duty and possess the best information and wherewithal to defend Jonathan. It is profound enough for one to wager that if they are too cowed to defend the President, chances are that they are also lacking the will and fighting spirit to go on the offensive against the President’s tormentors in a season of rank partisan politics. Ditto for the President’s macro-home base, comprising of Bayelsa and Rivers.

The only occasional forays you see comprise of the spontaneous gusts from Doyin Okupe, and then the few reactionary press releases from Olisa Metuh, the PDP National Publicity Secretary. There might be a few others here and there but nothing yet comes close to counteracting or rebutting the barrage of mean-spirited attacks hauled daily at Jonathan and the institutions he commands. Then, you wonder whether the President’s men are on AWOL or worse, running scared.

There is no day you open the newspapers or venture into social media without being hit with this barrage of serial attacks on the President’s person and policies, issuing from the APC and those that despise Jonathan, much of it purveying flagrant distortions of the President’s stellar achievements in office. Conversely, you hardly see anything from the PDP or administration hawks geared to telling Nigerians their own story, the true story. If they believe that their few paid cliche-laden advertorials will cut it, they are dead wrong because Nigerians don’t trust advertorials, especially of the political kind. They form their opinions from articles, features and news which content, true or false, get vested in their minds when not contradicted.

We don’t hear about the quantum leaps in the construction of the Lokoja-Abuja expressway; we don’t hear about the humongous success that has become of Nigerian railways since Jonathan; we don’t hear about the many civil/infrastructural works completed and ongoing; we don’t hear about jobs created, the Abuja light rail, the many new tertiary institutions. almajiri education, airport projects, etc. We don’t hear anything, not even some explanations of why some few things have defied solution.

And on the hot-bottom issue of terrorism, you don’t see much hay being made of the string of successes regularly recorded by Nigerian military against terrorists, plus the many attacks our gallant but harried security services continue to nip in the bud by the day. What we hear are failed missions, continually celebrated and played-up to down the collective spirit of well-meaning Nigerians, and there is no counter-point. No strong play and celebration of our fellows that fell in the line of duty. Instead, you read annoying traducers egging Nigerian military to go on suicide mission in Chibok, like the Americans did in Yemen recently. They figure that such mission will be bloody and bound to fail; and once that happens, it will then be played up for maximum negative effect Jonathan, going into 2015. Daily, on the web and hard copy, we read pieces baying blood and we remain silent. It has become so pathetic that an undefended Nigerian military has done the unusual of taking to social media to respond to the hate and lies consistently being spread against it. You can imagine the toll on morale; yet, civilian political leadership gives the military no media rearguard, no soft landing. Check out the unchecked APC negative play on the Court Martial and you would think that there is no Code of Military Justice in Nigeria. Sad.

Why are we not hearing from the Minsters and other political appointees? Why are they not telling Nigerians the details of what Jonathan has achieved? Do they believe that every Nigerian is supposed to sniff out Jonathan’s achievements and travails, or are we supposed to know without being informed about the milestones and the details? Why are administration and party points-men keeping silent while the record of what they have done is being mercilessly distorted? And where is the famous PDP grassroots appeal? Yet, in the suburbs, in rural Nigeria, in the wards where the votes are, all you see is APC swagger sans challenge.

After conquering mainstream media, APC has now moved pronto to social media and is fast besting PDP there too. Don’t they know that apart from city folks, Nigerians in rural areas mostly and firstly access social media for news through their phones and androids? This is the single factor most responsible for the looming new high on Buhari. Or doesn’t the PDP know that there’s such a new high, even though nurtured on unchecked propaganda and false hopes. Bayelsa (and Rivers), have you forsaken thy son? Your complacence is so open and notorious, such that those that despise Jonathan for his roots are now convinced that he is Igbo, just because it is Igbos that appear most to have taken up the case for Jonathan.

Where are the PDP national, state and local officials? Why are they not saying something for their party, their government, their President? Why are they busy enjoying the patronage of the party and the government, and then expect some TAN, GSG, and other non-party, citizen-driven organizations to be doing what their party ranks are supposed to be doing? Even in the face of the bickering that followed the congresses, can’t the PDP summon the collective will and partisan fervor to reclaim the political space? Or at least meet APC toe-to-toe on the turf? What about organizing ward-to-ward media meets, town halls, some noisy political fanfare? It’s telling enough that the President’s wife, as the newspapers reported, has turned to ‘begging’ voters not to abandon her husband. If the apparatchiks and faithful are doing their job, the First Lady would only be heard basking in the glory of it all. She cried out because, as someone that shares the Presidents bed, she is at vantage point to feel the man’s pains; plus she must have noticed the same troubling trend that propelled this article.

Why are those sending threatening text messages to Jonathan’s supporters not being arrested and prosecuted or at least made to understand that we have laws against such? If the administration doesn’t have the guile to act, then where is the tough partisan talk that should be geared to fending off such ‘terrorists’ and reassuring those they threaten that they are safe in Jonathan’s hands? Why are those openly inciting Nigerian military to mutiny not being aggressively and swiftly questioned or confronted with our laws against treasonable felony? Do we have to make do with Doyin Okupe’s or DSS’s one-page wry condemnations and warnings? Don’t they know that there are many legal ways of taming those that hide under their immunity to commit iniquity?

Frankly, it does not make sense that in this era of rabid terrorism and the looming 2015 election violence and failed state predictions, the government appears to do nothing when certain elements openly and brazenly break national security laws in the name of politics. Something gotta give or you begin to lose your supporters and otherwise good citizens that have been scared away from you. Even a loving and devoted wife begins to lose respect and affection for a spouse that appears to leave her undefended. Why is federal law enforcement reticent after the Governor of Gombe was nearly lynched in his own State and government vehicles in his entourage destroyed? So, even the almighty Governors can no longer campaign for PDP in their domain? Then what happens to ordinary supporters of the party? And now this: Awhile back, Governor Lamido of Jigawa cried out that he is being threatened by his fellows for being a member of PDP and pro-Jonathan. Why didn’t the authorities or even the party act swiftly, publicly and aggressively defend the Governor and then warning off the tugs that unlawfully rattled him? That failure to act is why Lamido held his crowded rally for PDP candidates in Jigawa, sans mentioning Jonathan’s name or even displaying his posters.

If one waxes superstitious for a moment, you will bet your last Naira that APC has managed to weave some talisman or juju that has tied PDP’s tongues. If that were to be so; then you may ask this: PDP, where art thy talisman that you have successfully relied on since 1999 to dominate federal power? Or this: Mr. President, where art thy men?

820|New Tunisian President Takes Office Vowing National Reconciliation|"MOSCOW, December 31 (Sputnik) — The new Tunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi has officially taken office having won the first democratic elections after the 2011 revolution which ousted the country's former leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the BBC reported Wednesday.

During his oath speech Essebsi vowed to ensure national reconciliation as ""president of all Tunisians,"" according to the BBC.

""There is no future for Tunisia without consensus among political parties and members of civil society,"" the BBC quoted Essebsi as saying.

Essebsi defeated interim President Moncef Marzouki during the presidential elections December 21, winning 55.6 percent of votes.

Born in 1926, the newly elected Tunisian president served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1981 to 1986 and as Prime Minister from February 2011 to December 2011. He is also the founder of the secular Nidaa Tounes party, which won the parliamentary elections in Tunisia in October 2014.

Following the coup against Ben Ali in 2011, also known as the Jasmine Revolution, the country was ruled by an interim government. The revolution was triggered by the poor social and economic situation in Tunisia, as well as by a lack of democratic rights and freedoms."

Mehbooba Mufti did not specify if the (BJP), with 25 legislators, was supporting her but made a pointed laudatory reference to former prime minister and now ailing BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader met the governor for about 90 minutes at the Raj Bhavan in this winter capital, official sources told IANS.

Mehbooba Mufti later told the media: ""We have the support of 55 MLAs. It is our intention that a stable government is formed to address the huge problems faced by the people in the state.

""We want that the agenda of development and peace should be carried forward. We want Atal Bihari Vajpayee's peace process (with Pakistan) to be carried to its logical conclusion,"" she added.

She, however, did not specify if a PDP-BJP alliance will take office in the state although most pundits believe that will be the case.

The PDP and BJP together command 53 legislators. The BJP won all its seats in the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the PDP won all but two seats in the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley.

It was not clear which two other legislators propose to back the PDP-BJP government. The People's Conference of former militant Sajad Lone has two members in the house and he had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The National Conference, which was voted out in the election, won 15 seats and the Congress, its estranged ally, 12. Seven seats went to independents and smaller parties including two to Lone's party.

Amid the political uncertainty that followed the hung verdict, the BJP held discussions with the National Conference but there was opposition to partnering with the BJP within the National Conference.

Vohra sent separate letters to the PDP and the BJP for discussions on government formation.

BJP general secretary Ram Madhav called on Vohra Tuesday along with state party president Jugul Kishore."
822|Palestinians Seek To Join International Criminal Court|"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has signed 20 international agreements, including one to join the International Criminal Court, a step that is likely to draw sharp response from Israel and the U.S.

The move comes a day after the U.N. Security Council rejected a Palestinian draft resolution that called for, among other things, an end to the Israeli occupation by 2017.

'We are being attacked every day, who will we complain to now that the UNSC has failed us?"" Abbas said at an emergency meeting today with Palestinian officials in the West Bank city of Ramallah. He added that the rejection of the resolution ""will not stop us from prosecuting"" Israel.

The comments in Arabic were translated by the official Palestine New Agency, or Wafa.

Membership in the ICC could allow the Palestinians a means to pursue war crimes charges against Israel.

The U.S. State Department criticized the Palestinian move, calling it ""counterproductive.""

In Israel, the Haaretz newspaper reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a meeting Thursday to discuss his country's response. Separately, Netanyahu said it's Palestinians who should fear the ICC because Abbas is in a national unity government with Hamas ""a declared terrorist organization who like ISIS commits war crimes.""

823|US opens diplomatic mission for Somalia, keeps operations in neighboring Kenya|"WASHINGTON — The U.S. has opened a mission for Somalia as part of its effort to normalize relations with the Eastern Africa nation, which continues to battle Islamic extremist rebels.

In a statement issued Tuesday, the State Department said the U.S. mission is based in the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. It will be led by a chargÃ© d'affaires until President Barack Obama appoints and the Senate confirms an ambassador.

The State Department said U.S. officials will continue to travel to Somalia to conduct official business as security conditions permit.

The U.S. recognized the Federal Government of Somalia in January 2013. Secretary of State John Kerry announced plans for re-establishing a diplomatic presence in Somalia when he visited its capital, Mogadishu, last May.

Kerry became the first U.S. secretary of state to visit Somalia when he spent three hours at an airport there amid tight security. In a symbolic visit showing support for its fledgling government, Kerry promised that the U.S. would help the nation recover from decades of conflict.

Somalia has a population estimated by U.S. officials at 10.6 million. In July, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud ruled out the possibility of elections set for next year because of an Islamic insurgency that has terrorized Somalia for the last eight years.

Somalia's Islamic extremist rebels al-Shabab, who have been driven from strongholds but still operate in some rural parts of the country, have stepped up attacks against coalition military forces, government officials and foreigners in recent months. Last week they overran an African Union military base southwest of the capital and claimed killing 50 of the soldiers stationed there.

Conflict has roiled Somalia since 1991, the year that warlords ousted dictator Siad Barre. In the wake of the formation of the Federal Government of Somalia, African Union forces from Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, Burundi and Djibouti backed the government against al-Shabab, which is allied to al-Qaida."
824|A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Costumes, Hairstyling and Makeup of 'Into the Woods'|"To me, the most impressive thing about the musical Into the Woods, Disney's big Oscar hopeful this season, is the quality of its craftwork — the great Colleen Atwood's costumes, Peter Swords King's hairstyling and makeup and J. Roy Helland's makeup work with Meryl Streep. It is, literally and figuratively, out of this world.

For that reason, The Hollywood Reporter is pleased to exclusively debut a featurette — which will later appear as part of a TV promotional spot for the film — about how those aspects all came together.

Among the more notable things discussed in the eight-minute piece:

How Atwood, a 10-time Oscar nominee, worked with director Rob Marshall — with whom she previously collaborated on Chicago (2002), Memoirs of a Geisha (2005) and Nine (2009), earning noms for all three and winning for the first two — and the actors to devise the looks of the various costumes The thought process behind some of the most memorable costumes in the film — Cinderella's dress for the ball, the Wolf's zoot suit and the Witch's outfit, among others — and how Atwood oversaw what Streep describes as ""the largest shop I've ever seen on a film of seamstresses""How Atwood managed to hide the ironic fact that Emily Blunt, who was playing the baby-craving Baker's Wife, was, in fact, very pregnant in real lifeWhy King felt that modern hairstyles were appropriate for almost all the characters except Cinderella's evil familyHow Helland — who has known Streep for 40 years, has been her personal makeup artist on every film that she's been a part of since Sophie's Choice (1982) and won an Oscar for The Iron Lady (2011) — works to blend her vision for a character's appearance with his (Watch her thank him profusely, calling him ""my other partner"" in addition to her husband, when she won her Oscar for The Iron Lady.)

825|Australia bans commercial sunbeds over cancer fears - Regional|"SYDNEY: Most Australian states and territories are set to ban commercial sunbeds in a crackdown on artificial tanning in a country that has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world.

The ban – which comes into force in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland and in the Australian Capital Territory today – will make Australia the second nation after Brazil to impose such a restriction, campaigners said.

Western Australia has said it would also implement a ban, though it has yet to announce a start date. There are no commercial solariums in the only other part of Australia – the hot and humid Northern Territory.

Cancer Council Australia welcomed the ban, which it has long pushed for, adding that it would help to reduce rates of skin cancer, which affects two out of three Australians by age 70.

“Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world,“ advocacy director Paul Grogan said.

“Solariums expose users to extremely highly levels of UV (ultraviolet) radiation, greatly increasing their risk of melanoma and other skin cancers.”

Australia is sometimes referred to as the sunburnt country, where beaches are thronged with bathers basking under blue skies and the rates of melanoma, a potentially fatal form of skin cancer, are the highest in the world.

Public health campaigners have long pushed to promote awareness of the dangers of sun exposure, urging people to wear sunscreen, hats and sunglasses. They also warned that tanning on a sunbed is not safe.

“Queensland already has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world and there is no question that there is a direct link between regular sunbed use and the incidence of malignant melanoma,” the state’s interim Health Minister Mark McArdle said.

The incidence of skin cancers in Australia is two to three times the rates in Canada, the United States and Britain, the Cancer Council said.

More than 2000 Australians died from skin cancer in 2011, the majority from melanoma, which is caused by harmful UV light from the sun, the council added. — AFP"
826|Better weather allows AirAsia search to resume|"PANGKALAN BUN, Indonesia — A much needed break in the weather gave searchers a window Thursday to ""fight with full force"" to find the victims of AirAsia Flight 8501, with officials also hustling to locate the fuselage of the plane that crashed in the sea four days ago.

Only seven of the 162 bodies have been recovered so far, with four of them found over the past two days arriving Thursday morning in Pangkalan Bun on Borneo island. They will later be flown for identification to Surabaya, where the two-hour flight to Singapore originated on Sunday.

""The visibility is good this morning, we are ready to fight with full force to search for bodies, wreckages that can reveal what went wrong with this accident,"" said First Marshal Agus Dwi Putranto, an Air Force Operation commander helping to lead the search, adding four aircraft were dispatched to the area just after sunrise.

Choppy conditions had prevented divers from entering the water on Wednesday, and helicopters were largely grounded. But 18 ships surveyed the narrowed search area. Sonar images identified what appeared to be large parts of the plane, but strong currents were moving the debris.

Thursday's break in weather — blue skies and calm seas despite earlier storm predictions — could greatly speed up recovery efforts that have been severely hampered since the first bodies were spotted on Tuesday. Vice Air Marshal Sunarbowo Sandi, search and rescue coordinator in Pangkalan Bun, the closest town to the targeted area, said he was hopeful divers would be able to explore the wreckage site.

""It's possible the bodies are in the fuselage,"" he said. ""So it's a race now against time and weather.""

World ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1

It is still unclear what brought the plane down. The jet's last communication indicated the pilots were worried about bad weather. They sought permission to climb above threatening clouds but were denied because of heavy air traffic. Four minutes later, the airliner disappeared from the radar without issuing a distress signal.

The cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders, or black boxes, must be retrieved before officials can start determining what caused the crash. Some items recovered so far include a life jacket, an emergency exit window, children's shoes, a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food.

Simple wooden coffins — numbered 001 and 002 — with purple flowers on top contained the first two bodies, which were sent Wednesday from Pangkalan Bun to Surabaya for autopsies. The two victims were a woman wearing blue jeans and a boy. Three males and two females were also recovered, all but one was transported from a warship Thursday.

Nearly all the passengers were Indonesian, and many were Christians of Chinese descent. The country is predominantly Muslim, but sizeable pockets of people of other faiths are found throughout the sprawling archipelago. Around 10 percent of those in Surabaya, the nation's second-largest city, are Christian.

Many family members have remained at the Surabaya airport since getting word that the plane had disappeared. Some, like 15-year-old Chiara Natasha, are now alone.

Her entire family was coming to visit her in Singapore for New Year's.

She had just moved there in November to study at a Methodist girls' school on a government scholarship. Her parents and two brothers had promised to join her to celebrate the holiday and help her settle into dormitory life.

But instead of greeting her relatives at the airport, she returned home Sunday to Surabaya, Indonesia, to seek any word about the fate of AirAsia Flight 8501, praying that they had somehow survived.

Families who lost loved ones aboard the jetliner endured another excruciating day of waiting Wednesday as bad weather hindered efforts to recover any more bodies and sent wreckage drifting far from the crash site.

""Help us, God, to move forward, even though we are surrounded by darkness,"" the Rev. Philip Mantofa, whose church lost about 40 members in the disaster, told families gathered in a waiting room at the Surabaya airport.

On Wednesday, about 100 relatives gathered for the airport prayer service where Mantofa urged them to hold onto their faith despite their pain. About 40 members of his Mawar Sharon Church died in the crash.

""Some things do not make sense to us, but God is bigger than all this,"" he said. ""Our God is not evil.""

Before breaking up, those gathered stood together and sang with their hands reaching upward. ""I surrender all. I surrender all,"" they repeated. ""I surrender all to God our savior.""

Many family members had planned to travel to Pangkalan Bun, 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the area where bodies were first spotted, to start identifying their loved ones. However, the manager of the Surabaya airport, Trikora Hardjo, later said the trip was canceled after authorities suggested their presence could slow down the operation.

Instead, some relatives gave blood for DNA tests and submitted photos of their loved ones along with identifying information such as tattoos or birthmarks that could help make the process easier."

Three-Span zipline system at Ski Apache boasts the highest Zipline in the U.S.

Ski Apache is kicking off the new year by opening its Apache Wind Rider ZipTour New Year's Day, according to a Dec. 31 press release. The three-span zipline offers guests a high-speed, high altitude adventure for a panoramic high mountain zipping experience.

Ski Apache's zipline adventure features views of more than 55 ski runs nestled in the Lincoln National Forest at the nation's southern-most continually operating ski area.

The ziptour starts at 11,500 feet in elevation above the ""Apache Bowl"" and is more than 8,900 feet in total length. The first leg is more than 5,000 feet long and reaches speeds nearing 60 mph. The next leg is 1,900 feet from the top of the Elk Lift line to the top of Capitan. The last leg is another 1,700-foot ride that begins at the top of Capitan and finishes at the base of Ski Apache.

The slopes are ready to welcome Ski Apache Wind Rider ZipTour riders. The cables open Jan. 1, weather permitting. (Elva K. Österreich - Ruidoso News)

""We are so excited for this new addition,"" Frizzell Frizzell Jr., chief operating officer of Inn of the Mountain Gods Resort & Casino said. ""Not only is it tremendous that we've created one of the largest ziplines in the world, but this is just a reflection of how the Mescalero Apache Tribe is continually finding ways to invest in the experience we provide to our guests. Thank you to the Tribal Administration and IMG Management Board for allowing us to build this one-of-a-kind experience.""

Ski Apache Operations Manager Justin Rowland said the ziptour is available and will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily, weather permitting. He has had the opportunity to try out the zipline himself.

""It is probably one of the most awesome, exhilarating experiences that you will ever have a chance to experience,"" Rowland said. ""With the scenery and length, it's just amazing.""

What sets the Apache Wind Rider ZipTour zipline canopy tour system apart from other zipline canopy tours is the patented ZipTour trolley, the press release said, which allows the customer to control their speed of descent and overall ride experience. The multi-stage zipline tour design allows guests to explore terrain via multiple zipline spans and short walks in between the spans.

Marvin Wolf, a Ski Apache Wind Rider ZipTour guide, demonstrates the harness and fittings, during training in November, as Eugene Mancito watches. (Elva K. Österreich - Ruidoso News)

The braking technology of the ZipTour allows for cable spans that are longer, steeper and more dramatic than the typical zipline canopy tour. Instead of a 4-5 hour commitment to ride countless zipline spans back and forth down a portion of a mountain, the ZipTour gives a full mountain exploration tour, top to bottom, in approximately one hour.

Slated to open later in 2015, according to the press release, the Apache Eagle ZipRider at Inn of the Mountain Gods will offer an exhilarating yet peaceful zipline experience with views of Inn of the Mountain Gods and Lake Mescalero. Once operational, the majestic trip will take three minutes and reach speeds of 30-plus mph.

Ski Apache Wind Rider ZipTour guides have been in training since November to lead guests down three legs of zip line with views of more than 55 ski runs on the way. From left, in back, are guides Harry Wheeler Jr., Clarence Mendez, Eugene Mancito, Marvin Wolf, Ray Rocha III, Jared Rocha and zip tour manager Chris Loretto.

""The tribe is well-known for striving to make every project the very best it can be,"" Danny Breuninger, president of the Mescalero Apache Tribe said. ""These world-class ziplines are no exception, and the tribe is happy to invest in a project that will make a significant economic impact to our area.""

Tickets are on sale now for the Apache Wind Rider ZipTour: $65 for adults and $58 for children and seniors (age 10-13 and 60 years and older).

829|Taiwan’s Ma Seeks Domestic Reconciliation After China Backlash|"(Bloomberg) -- President Ma Ying-jeou called for social reconciliation within Taiwan after student protests and electoral defeats served to rebut his pro-China policies.

“Outspoken youth and their online networking re-energized our society. Some people welcomed it, while others had reservations,” Ma, 64, said in a New Year address from the presidential office in Taipei. “I think it was a good thing when seen from a long-term perspective.”

The embattled leader, whose approval rating stood at 14.2 percent according to a December poll, voiced support during the year for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests after facing a protracted student-led demonstration at home against a cross-strait trade agreement.

In a sign of indifference toward his economic policies, voters on Nov. 29 delivered Ma’s party, the Kuomintang, its worst-ever loss in local-level elections, swayed instead by opposition to his moves to bring Taiwan closer to China and by public scandals.

“The antagonism that has long plagued relations between the ruling and opposition camps has prevented effective cooperation,” Ma said today. “This has been my greatest regret since taking office.”

Officials from Taipei and Beijing met for the first time in 65 years in the former Chinese capital of Nanjing in February, with Taiwan officials delivering a request from Ma to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in November.

Chinese officials declined on account of the venue, according to Taiwan’s top mainland affairs official. Xi had said in 2013 the political impasse between the two governments shouldn’t be passed on to the next generation.

Student Protests

A month after the historic Nanjing meeting, Taiwan student leaders expressed outrage against an agreement opening up industries such as banking, hospitals and hair salons across the Taiwan Strait by storming into government buildings and occupying the legislature until officials agreed to implement measures for greater transparency in future deals.

The events preceded an 11-week pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, that erupted at the end of the summer.

China will continue to develop ties with Taiwan based on the “1992 consensus,” according to comments posted Dec. 17 on the People’s Daily website from Taiwan Affairs Office spokeswoman Fan Liqing.

The consensus stresses the existence of one China, with Beijing and Taipei maintaining separate interpretations. Taiwan’s formal name is the Republic of China, a government founded in 1911 and moved to Taiwan in 1949 when general Chiang Kai-shek fled China during a civil war against Mao Zedong’s Communist armies.

Freeing Trade

Taiwan’s $526.8 billion economy may have grown 3.43 percent in 2014, its statistics bureau forecast in November, the fastest pace in three years. Spurred by improving demand for its electronic goods and semiconductors in developed countries, Taiwan’s growth may have outpaced Singapore’s 2.8 percent, and may be close to South Korea’s estimated 3.5 percent expansion last year.

Real wages, meanwhile, have fallen since the late 1990s, according to Taiwan’s government. Ma’s administration opened direct flights and tourism links with China when he took office in 2008 and has in recent years sought to stimulate economic renewal through further liberalization, in the form of regional and bilateral free-trade agreements as well as the planning of economic pilot zones featuring relaxed customs, tax and other regulatory requirements.

No Exception

“It’s very hard for any leader to sell trade/investment liberalization agreements, because most of the costs of opening one’s domestic market are immediate and specific whereas the benefits (in terms of structural adjustment) are general and long-term,” Richard Bush, director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institute and formerly the top U.S. official in Taiwan, wrote in an e-mail. “President Ma is no exception.”

Ma, who is due to end his second and final term in 2016, also called for continued peace and stability in Taiwan’s relationship with China, which stands as both its biggest economic partner and largest external threat.

“Achieving reconciliation within our society is only part of the picture; in addition, cross-strait peace must be consolidated,” Ma said. “As I see it, we seek but three goals in our conduct of cross-strait relations. The first is peace. The second is also peace. And the third, once again, is peace.

US releases 5 more Guantanamo Bay prisoners, sends them to Kazakhstan

Fox News ^ | Dec 31, 2014

Posted on by Ray76

The Defense Department announced Wednesday that five more prisoners will be transferred out of Guantanamo Bay to another nation, in the latest step by the Obama administration to whittle down the prisoner population in pursuit of ultimately closing the camp.

The five men will be transferred to the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan for resettlement, the U.S. government announced.

The two men from Tunisia and three from Yemen -- who have been at the camp for a dozen years -- had been cleared for release from the prison by a government task force but could not be sent to their homelands.

The U.S. identified the Yemenis as Asim Thabit Abdullah Al-Khalaqi, who is about 46; Muhammad Ali Husayn Khanayna, who is about 36; and Sabri Mohammad al Qurashi, about 44.

According to a 2007 Defense document, posted on The New York Times website, Al-Khalaqi was ""assessed"" to be part of Al Qaeda and was captured alongside an Al Qaeda commander at Tora Bora.

Al Qurashi, likewise, allegedly got ""militant training"" at an Al Qaeda training camp and was arrested at an Al Qaeda safe house. Both were assessed to be ""medium risk.""

832|2014 ends with some feel-good stories of people reaching out to help others.|"As 2014 came to a close, it was easy to focus on the negative: loss of an airliner, toll of Ebola, outrage in Ferguson, Mo. …

So I’d like to highlight some positive stories, small acts of kindness that restore faith in the human spirit. After all, as they say, good things do come in small packages.

Delivering joy: In mid-December, Jessa Levy’s wallet was either lost or stolen while she was visiting a friend who lives near San Diego State University. The 21-year-old Mesa College student was bummed because in it was $65 in baby-sitting money she had saved to play “secret Santa” to her young nephews and niece.

On Dec. 19, she received a good news call from the FedEx office in Mira Mesa. A delivery man had spotted her driver’s license and debit cards on a sidewalk along Montezuma Road.

Within an hour, Jessa was there, retrieved her belongings and gratefully thanked the FedEx team for tracking her down via Facebook. Then she retreated to her car where, moments later, a FedEx employee discovered her sobbing. Jessa explained that, while happy to get her cards back, her money to buy gifts was gone.

Later that day, Jessa received another call from the FedEx office asking her to stop by.

When she reappeared, this time she was handed a personalized card that read, in part: “Buy your presents and get yourself something special on behalf of your friends at Federal Express Ground.” In the envelope was $230 that employees had chipped in for her.

Once again Jessa started crying, but this time, though, they were tears of joy. She bought her family presents and filled her car up with gas.

“It’s not a big story compared to others,” said Laurie Soto Levy, Jessa’s mom. “But it’s an amazing display of generosity and compassion. The FedEx team stepped in to restore my daughter’s Christmas.”

Helping hand: On Dec. 17, a young man showed up at a little blue house on Fourth Avenue in Hillcrest. The visitor, a law student at Oxford University in London and former San Diegan, wanted to do some volunteer work during his return here on vacation. He chose the Glenner Memory Care Center, a day care program serving adults with dementia and giving their caregivers a much-needed break.

Michael Paranal played his ukulele and sang with the seniors. When he left, he gave each of the 24 program participants a parting gift — a newly purchased blanket. On his Facebook page, he later posted: “Seeing the smiles on their faces was worth it — jetlag and all.”

It takes a village: For five days and nights, Maria Sacco, searched in vain for her tiny dog — a Chihuahua-Jack Russell terrier mix. On Sunday, Dec. 13, Toby had wiggled out of his harness while running alongside her friends in Mission Trails Regional Park. Toby disappeared into the brush three miles away from where the outing had begun near the end of Clairemont Mesa Boulevard.

Sacco posted “LOST” signs and alerted park visitors to be on the lookout for a white, seven-pound dog.

She estimates 40 to 50 people – running group members, friends and concerned Tierrasanta residents – joined in the hunt for Toby over the next few days.

The Vista dog owner’s hopes waned when she heard coyotes howling on Sunday night and again late Monday. But subsequent sightings of the elusive runaway pup were posted online.

So Sacco kept vigil in her car all Tuesday night, stayed Wednesday until 2 a.m. and spent all Thursday night on guard at the end of Clairemont Mesa Boulevard. “I was determined I wasn’t leaving until I found him,” she said.

Then came the miracle. “I think your dog’s right here,” yelled a man as he was just entering the trail on Friday. Sacco jumped out of her car but by the time she reached the man, Toby, once again, had disappeared. When she called him, though, he came running, jumped into her arms, then into her car, not about to budge.

Although a couple pounds lighter, Toby, otherwise, emerged healthy and happy.

“This is a miracle,” said Sacco.

For her, as for Jessa Levy, Christmas came in the form of many helping hands proving that, despite all the negative news, people still truly do care and are ready to help one another."

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - Starting tomorrow, Afghanistan's 350,000-strong forces will officially take responsibility for security in their country, as international forces end their 13-year combat mission.

As NATO's role ends, one of Afghanistan's leaders says he has persuaded hundreds of insurgents to support peace efforts. He says he's reached an agreement with some 300 Taliban fighters in the north to lay down their arms.

Officials have said that 2014 was the deadliest of the war for government forces and civilians.

And the violence continued right up to the end of the year. A Taliban attack was thwarted today, as security forces stopped a car and a motorcycle that were loaded with explosives. They were carrying gunmen who then shot dead a policeman and two civilians."
834|In our opinion: Pioneer Park Coalition provides suggestions for homeless problems|"RIO DE JANEIRO - The highway has been torn down, tunnels dug, and the walkways and gardens laid in Rio de Janeiro's new business district.

But the dozens of office towers needed to make the 8 billion real ($2 billion) renovation viable are missing.

The transformation of a derelict port district before the 2016 Olympic Games is a flagship development that wasn't supposed to cost Brazilian taxpayers a thing.

Less than a year before the Olympics, however, a real-estate meltdown in Rio has killed appetite for new skyscrapers and left a public fund - which paid upfront for infrastructure betting it could profit by selling building rights - shouldering the burden of the 8 billion real cost.

Of over 20 corporate developments planned, many with multiple towers, the vast majority have not broken ground.

They include the Trump Towers, a set of five high-rises gilded by a branding agreement with U.S. property mogul and presidential candidate Donald Trump. That project was announced in 2012 as the largest corporate development in any major emerging nation, but it too is still on the drawing board.

The few high-rises that are taking shape are spread thinly across the 3-km (2-mile) stretch of waterfront. When, or if, the others will be built is increasingly uncertain.



""The reality is worse than we imagined,"" says Vitor Hugo Pinto, manager of the port fund for the FGTS, a massive public investment vehicle financed by payroll deductions and managed by Caixa Economica Federal, one of Brazil's big state-owned banks.

The ""Porto Maravilha,"" or ""Marvelous Port,"" project was first drawn up in the heady days of 2011 when oil-rich Rio was riding high on a commodities boom and local authorities were pushing to give business heft to a city better known for beaches and ribald Carnival celebrations.

Porto Maravilha, they said, would create a public legacy on par with the makeover of Barcelona's waterfront for the 1992 Olympics.

It would also be a ""can't-lose"" commercial proposition in a city so eager to avoid white elephants that many Olympic venues will be temporary.

But oil prices have crashed along with those of other commodity exports that had fueled Brazil's boom and drove some Rio real estate valuations to New York or London levels.

Instead of an economic bonanza as the backdrop for the Olympics, which start next August, they will likely play out amid continued recession.

""The business plan has had to be revised,"" says Pedro de Seixas Correa, real estate professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a business school. ""Two years ago no one thought Brazil would be in recession.""



To be sure, Porto Maravilha may still make money. The public spaces completed, like an airy square flanked by a new art gallery and futuristic museum, have already transformed a once abandoned and dangerous part of the city.

Real estate experts argue the current rut is cyclical and point to successful dockland developments, like London's Canary Wharf, that suffered setbacks before rebounding.

The FGTS, for its part, has a little more than 20 years to make a profit. It believes over that period it can meet its target return of 6.5 percent a year above inflation in accumulated compound interest.

The fund, which invests on behalf of Brazil's unemployment coffers in sectors like infrastructure and real estate, aims to profit from the sale of building rights, partnerships with developers and the eventual sale of stakes in tower blocks.

When it won the 2011 auction to develop Porto Maravilha, the fund bought building rights to the area from the city for 3.5 billion reais. As part of the deal, and in exchange for reselling the rights to developers, FGTS agreed to invest another 4.5 billion reais over 15 years.



So far, that money has paid to demolish a gritty highway that cut through the neighborhood, drill three tunnels to replace it, and build the square and museum. By June, 75 percent of the work FGTS is responsible for had been completed, it said.

But the fund has only resold about 9 percent of the building rights so far. A price at an auction of rights in 2012 suggests FGTS has recouped just 650 million reais.

Fund manager Pinto says he has preliminary agreements with developers for a greater number of building rights, about a third of the total, but they are not accounted as ""sold"" until building begins.

""Obviously the economic environment has slowed some of the projects,"" he said.



Two of the five ""Trump Towers"" were supposed to be ready by the Olympics, but ground has not been broken and Rio's mayor, Eduardo Paes, is skeptical.

""That stupid thing isn't going up,"" Paes said recently, reflecting a loss of patience since he announced the project three years ago as he sat beside Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr.

A spokesperson for the New York-based Trump Organization said the project is still in ""the design and planning phases.""

One of the project's developers, MRP International, declined to comment. The other, Even Construtora e Incorporadora, did not respond to requests for comment.

Trump has put his name to the project but is not investing in it and has no risk of losing any money.



""The project is a reality, the timeline will just be a bit longer,"" Pinto said.

With commercial interest sluggish, FGTS and City Hall are exploring whether there is greater appetite for building housing blocks instead. Though residential prices are falling in real terms, they haven't fallen as much as office space.

More housing could also improve security in an area that is deserted at night and can be dangerous.

But given the downturn, and a projected glut from housing planned in the boom years but hitting the market now, demand may be tepid. Developers behind Ilha Pura, a vast complex across town which will house athletes during the Olympics, have sold less than 10 percent of 3,600 apartments. They declined to say what their target had been for this stage.

At Porto Maravilha's main square on a recent afternoon, light-rail tracks, another Olympic project, were being laid toward the planned business district. There was not a single tower in sight.

Pinto remains patient though.

""The question we ask ourselves is not 'Will the port turn out okay?' but 'How long will it take?'"""
835|Gov’t accuses Reds of breaking the truce|"MANILA, Philippines—The government on Wednesday challenged the communists to “walk their talk” toward resuming peace talks after a series of incidents that the presidential peace adviser said had undermined their Christmas ceasefire.

“In blatant disregard of the Christmas season, when our people desire and expect peace and goodwill, the CPP-NPA-NDF (Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front) reciprocated the government’s gesture of a month-long unilateral ceasefire with acts of senseless violence,” Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Teresita Deles said in a statement.

Deles cited three recent incidents in a span of one week that not only caused destruction to property, but also resulted in the loss of lives.

A unilateral suspension of military and police operations took effect on Dec. 19 to end on Jan. 19, the day Pope Francis wraps up his four-day visit to the Philippines.

Deles denounced the NPA’s torching of building construction equipment in Camarines Norte, and the burning of a civilian vehicle in Agusan del Sur on Dec. 22.

“Both acts were committed in retaliation of the civilians’ refusal to give in to their extortion,” Deles said.

The next day, communist rebels abducted Compostela Valley jail warden Jose Mervin Gementiza Coquilla in Panabo City, Davao del Norte.

On Dec. 29, the NPA was suspected in the killing of 1st Lt. Ronald Bautista, Pfc. Albert Amor and military volunteer Renel Baluca in Sitio (settlement) Barigyan, Mabini, Compostela Valley.

Deles said the three men were “unarmed soldiers in civilian clothes on their way to spend the holidays with their families when they were shot point-blank by members of the NPA.”—Nikko Dizon"

839|Asian Slack Puts Oman-Brent Gap at Six-Month Low|"Middle Eastern oil bound for Asia is trading at its biggest discount to Brent crude since June, signaling slack demand from China to Japan and India to Indonesia.

The CHART OF THE DAY shows the Oman crude contract traded on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange was about $4.23 a barrel cheaper than Brent on ICE Futures Europe, the biggest discount since June 19. Oil demand from Asia Pacific will be 31.2 million barrels a day in 2015, unchanged from the level in the final three months of this year, according to the International Energy Agency. Demand from the Americas is forecast at 31 million barrels.

“For the first time in what seems like forever, Asia is not going to need more crude than the year before,” said Michael Dei-Michei, an analyst at research firm JBC Energy GmbH in Vienna. “Supplies have risen and demand is unchanged.”

The Oman crude contract serves as a benchmark for oil sales to Asia. Meanwhile Brent plunged 46 percent this year, and is set for the biggest annual drop since 2008, as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries resisted supply cuts to defend market share in response to the U.S.’s highest output in three decades.

OPEC cut the forecast for how much crude it will need to produce in 2015, and its three largest members, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait are offering oil to Asian buyers at the biggest discounts in at least six years.

843|However you say it, chicken in a pot is wonderful|"Chicken in a pot. Not a very romantic name, I'll admit. Luckily, the French have the more melodic ""poule au pot"" to fill that gap for this utterly delicious dish.

But however you say it, chicken in a pot is a traditional French country dish that dates back to Henry IV in the 17th century. You see, he apparently promised that during his reign everyone would be able to afford chicken in a pot on Sundays. A few hundred years later, this idea was revived in American politics when Herbert Hoover's presidential campaign promised a chicken in every pot, and a car in every garage.

Monarchs and presidents aside, you need to learn this simple and fantastic recipe.

The traditional version of chicken in a pot consists of a whole stuffed chicken poached with vegetables. All of the ingredients contribute to a rich broth, which then is served over the chicken and vegetables, often garnished with pickles, mustard and coarse salt.

But truth is, most of us won't bother with the stuffing. And that's a good thing. Because then this becomes a lean dish, one well-suited for the new year as we try to recover from the excesses of the holidays.

Given that all animal protein becomes tough when boiled, the key to success in this recipe is to cook the chicken gently, ensuring that it stays moist and tender. In my recipe, the chicken simmers softly for just 25 minutes. Then, pulled off the burner, it finishes cooking in the residual heat of the broth. The vegetables are cooked afterward in the same broth.

Finally, the chicken is skinned, deboned and returned to the pot in large chunks, but only to be reheated, not cooked any further. All of this care pays off in the finished texture of the star of the show. Rubber chicken is a dish only a comedian could love!

In terms of seasonings, I've taken this French dish to Morocco, adding ginger and harissa, a hot chili paste from Africa. I serve it with country bread, toasted and rubbed with garlic, though you're welcome to ladle the chicken and vegetables onto couscous instead, which would complete the Moroccan theme. Whatever you decide, this is a wonderful dish to serve to a crowd.

Moroccan Chicken in a Pot

For the harissa:

16-ounce jar roasted red peppers, drained

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

2 teaspoons minced garlic

1 teaspoon cumin seeds

1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds

1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds

1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

2 teaspoons lemon juice

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

For the chicken:

3 tablespoons vegetable oil

2 large leeks, trimmed, halved lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces

1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered

1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic

1 1/2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger

3 1/2-pound whole chicken

3 quarts chicken broth

1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

1/2 pound parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

1/2 pound turnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

1/2 pound white potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces

Kosher salt and ground black pepper

Chopped fresh cilantro or parsley, to garnish

Start to finish: 1 hour 50 minutes (50 minutes active)

To prepare the harissa, in a blender combine all ingredients and blend until smooth. Set aside. Can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.

To prepare the chicken, in a 7- to 8-quart stockpot over medium, heat the oil. Add the leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

Add the chicken, breast side down, then pour the broth over it. The broth should cover the chicken. If not, add a bit of water or additional broth. Bring the broth just to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, skimming any scum that comes to the surface, for 10 minutes. Cover and reduce the heat to simmer gently for another 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the chicken sit in the hot broth, covered, for 30 minutes.

Carefully remove the chicken from the pot and set it on a plate. Let it cool until it can be easily handled.

Add the carrots, parsnips, turnips and potatoes to the broth, then bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, covered, until the vegetables are just tender, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, pull off and discard the skin from the chicken and remove the meat from the bones in large chunks. When the vegetables are tender, return the chicken meat to the pot and cook gently, just until heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle the soup into soup bowls and top each portion with a spoonful of harissa and some cilantro. Servings: 8"
844|News|"AFP Indian women participate in the opening ceremony of the three-day International Toilet Festival in New Delhi on November 18, 2014. From next month, officials will head out with mobile phones, tablets and iPads to report on whether toilets are being used in rural India. Picture: Roberto Schmidt

New Delhi - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is launching a nationwide online programme to check whether people are using toilets as part of his cleanliness drive.

From next month, officials will head out with mobile phones, tablets and iPads to report on whether toilets are being used in rural India, with results uploaded onto a website in real time.

India's shortage of toilets costs the country more than $50 billion a year, mostly through premature deaths and hygiene-related diseases, according to a World Bank study. India suffers a greater cost than other Asian countries from the poor collection of human excreta, the study found.

About 626 million Indians defecate in the open compared with 14 million in China, the World Health Organisation said in a 2012 report.

Since taking office in May, Modi has repeatedly lamented the poor state of sanitation and public cleanliness in India, vowing to solve the problems within the next five years.

The government has doubled spending on a toilet building programme and requested financial donations from some of the country's largest companies to help.

“Earlier, the monitoring was done only about the construction of toilets, but now the actual use of toilets will be ascertained,” the government said in a statement on Wednesday.

In October, Modi annoyed government officials by ordering them to come to work to clean toilets on a national holiday. - Reuters"
845|Westfield State University students honored for leadership|"

WESTFIELD - Westfield State University recently recognized nine students for their leadership and service to both the university and the community. Each student was recognized with the President’s Award for Excellence in Leadership.

The President’s Award of Excellence in Leadership was created in 2007 and can be awarded to any eligible student. A committee comprised of 12 faculty and peers review all applications.

To be eligible for the award, students can be nominated by a professor, but all must complete an application process including an essay about the community service they have done and how it has impacted their future goals.

The nine students selected this year are all seniors with an average grade point average of 3.62. Each of this year’s winners participate in a wide range of on- and off-campus activities. Several students are residents of Western Massachusetts, including Elizabeth Cauley, of Southampton, Miguel Maria, of Springfield, Nicole Godard, of Northfield, and, Rebecca DiVico, of Belchertown.

An elementary education and liberal studies double major, Cauley is co-president of the Dance Company, works on campus as a staff development assistant, and assists during new student and parent orientation. Her community service efforts including participating in Relay for Life, the Rays of Hope charity walk, and volunteering at the American Red Cross blood drive.

Cauley said working as a staff development assistant helped her learn how to balance multiple responsibilities.

“I have discovered that it is important to take care of yourself first and although I might want to put every ounce of myself into everything and gain an experience, I believe it’s okay to say ‘no’ and to delegate to others before experiencing burnout,” Cauley said.

A political science and economics double major, Maria served as an urban education student representative and is participated this semester in the Washington Center Program internship in Washington, D.C. His community service efforts include volunteering in several political campaigns, including U.S. Sen. Edward Markey’s 2013 race, and at Reading Partners.

Maria said he enjoyed his work with Reading Partners, an organization that provides one on one tutoring to students who have fallen behind in reading, and seeing his results.

“I was able to see a young student who had a short attention span and was a year and a half below grade level catch up,” Maria said. “I actively participated in helping him gain confidence in himself and a deeper love for reading and learning.”

Goddard, an English and secondary education double major, is president of Sigma Tau Delta honor society and a member of the university’s honors program. She is part of the Academic Pursuits Club and is a former member of the Quidditch Team. Her community service efforts include volunteering at Rays of Hope, for the National Day on Writing at Westfield State, and through a literacy project at South Middle School.

Godard said that being a good leader includes serving as a role model for others.

“The most effective way to inspire other members to volunteer their time and energy is to lead by example,” Godard said. “As Sigma Tau Delta president, I have promised my members that every moment they volunteer of their own time will be matched by a similar commitment on my part.”

Psychology major DiVico serves as president of Student Government Association and is a member of the Student Advisory Council. Her community service efforts include volunteering at the American Red Cross Blood Drive, the Out of the Darkness Suicide Prevention Walk, and “From Tween to Teen: Girls’ Group,” an art therapy group for adolescent girls.

DiVico said her leadership skills blossomed through involvement in the Student Government Association and she does all that she can to give back to Westfield State.

“Everything that I do outside of my academics is for the students of this campus,” DiVico said. “I am aware that what I am doing is not to better myself, but to benefit my peers who are a part of the Westfield State community. This university has done more for me than it will ever know and if I can help its students even in the smallest way, I can graduate in May proud of myself.”

The other honored students include Victoria Landry, of Milford, Sarah Varghese, of Westford, Angelo Burgos Jr. , of East Hartford, Beth Teague, of Tyngsboro, and Michael Brett, of Hanson.

The students were awarded at a dinner banquet earlier this month and were presented with plaques designating their honor."

According to Actual Experience’s scoring, 80 per cent is very good and 70 per cent is adequate. It said most major websites are almost impossible to upload below 60 per cent.

Mrs Sands said that there had been a problem with her house’s connection since the family moved in, in April 2011, and the development where they lived was further built on.

She claimed that not enough cables had been laid to cope with the demand for telephone and broadband, and that the problems had got worse as more homes had been added to the development – with 300 more set to come.

Mr Sands often needs to work from home, while the couple also have two children, aged three and six, who will soon need the internet for schoolwork.

“It is completely ridiculous,” said Mrs Sands. “We often have to leave the computer running over night to download things because it takes so long.

“You just wonder why a development would be given permission without ensuring that there is enough cabling for the internet.

“You wouldn’t not have water, gas or electricity, and the same should apply for the internet and phones.”

She added: “You would have thought in the 21st century, on the edge of Scotland’s biggest city, there would be good internet connections.

“They need to change the law to force developers to put in proper broadband connections.”

Dave Page, chief executive of Actual Experience, which produced the data, said: “The quality of broadband that Pauline and Graeme have been dealing with is atrocious. No-one in the UK should have to deal with a connection worse than the inhabitants of islands 9,000 miles away in the middle of the South Atlantic.”

The issue is one which has been raised in the House of Commons by shadow Labour energy minister Tom Greatrex, who represents the nearby Rutherglen constituency.

He claims the Scottish Government’s decision not to invest properly in broadband means Scotland is lagging behind.

Mr Greatrex said the roll-out of fibre optic broadband is funded by the UK government to the tune of £780 million, while its implementation in Scotland is devolved to the SNP government.

But the Scottish Government claimed that the problem was a lack of funding from Westminster.

A spokesman for SNP infrastructure secretary Keith Brown said: “Mr Greatrex seems more interested in cosying up to the Tory-Lib Dem coalition rather than arguing for more funding for Scotland.

“We are continuing to roll out coverage in the months ahead, and no doubt Mr Greatrex will welcome this.”

847|Pakistani, Afghan MPs call for further boost to ties|"Pakistani, Afghan MPs call for further boost to ties

Afghanistan Sun (IANS) Thursday 1st January, 2015

Pakistani and Afghan lawmakers Wednesday urged their governments to sign a strategic partnership agreement that will give a boost to bilateral relations between the two neighboring countries.

The members of parliament (MPs) who concluded a two-day security dialogue in Islamabad also called for a relaxed visa regime that allows multiple entry visas for citizens of either country, Xinhua reported.

In a joint statement, participants of the dialogue underscored the need for cooperation of the state and security agencies in the two countries in the fight against terrorism, extremism, and for achieving and maintaining peace and stability in the region.

The MPs stressed the need for comprehensive and effective laws on combating terrorism, including cyber-terrorism, and agreed that parliaments and parliamentary committees in both countries should oversee effective implementation of these laws.

The 18-member Afghan parliamentary delegation also met Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who told the guests that both Pakistan and Afghanistan were committed not to allow their territories to be used against each other to make the region peaceful, progress and prosperous.

""The two countries are committed to transform mutual relationship with a special focus on enhanced political engagement, deeper security and counter terrorism cooperation, expanded trade and economic partnership, and regional cooperation,"" said Sharif.

The parliamentarians also stressed that trade and commerce between the two countries must be prioritised and formalised. Both sides also supported removal of bottlenecks and trade barriers and emphasised that facilities for transit trade between the two neighbouring countries must be improved.

The two sides supported the initiatives to enhance connectivity between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including through a motorway between the northwestern city of Peshawar and Kabul and other rail and road links as well as building a trade central strategic corridor between the two countries.

The parliamentarians also favoured de-weaponisation and improved drug management across the border.

The joint statement stated that a strong and viable bilateral relationship is the guarantee of security, peace and development in the region."

Babies are powerful creatures, and celebrities are far from immune to their charms — as they proved in 2014, by sharing pics of those chubby cheeks, fingers and toes on Twitter and Instagram.

This past year provided a bumper crop of social media announcements and photos, proving yet again that newborns melt even the gruffest of hearts (we're looking at you, Simon Cowell) while also spurring creative expressions of protective love (hello, Ashton Kutcher and Kristen Bell).



Here's just a small selection of the famous progeny born this year — brace yourselves for cute overload!

850|Israel sends Palestinian ex-hunger striker Hanaa Shalabi to Gaza|"Israel on Sunday deported a female Palestinian prisoner who spent 43 days on hunger strike to the Gaza Strip, under a deal that has been criticized by Palestinians.

Eyewitnesses and Palestinian officials told AFP that Hanaa Shalabi entered Gaza via the Erez border crossing, and was being transferred by ambulance to a local hospital for tests.

Shalabi, who met relatives on the Israeli side of Erez before entering Gaza, said she was ""very happy to be in my country with my people,"" but that the encounter with her family — from Jenin in the West Bank — was very difficult.

""I was shocked meeting my family, and they were shocked to see me,"" she told the media on the Gaza side of Erez. ""The meeting with my family was very difficult.""

Shalabi was received in Gaza by approximately 100 people bearing her picture and calling out her name. Officials from the Islamic Jihad and Hamas movements were also there.

Israel's prison services spokesperson Sivan Weizman confirmed that Shalabi had been taken from the Ramla Prison south of Tel Aviv to the Erez crossing.

Weizman said Shalabi, who ended her hunger strike on 29 March, was being transferred in a regular vehicle, and said she had no details on her condition.

Shalabi began her hunger strike after she was arrested on 16 February and held without charge.

On 29 March, Palestinian authorities announced that Shalabi had agreed to a deal with Israel under which she would be released and deported to Gaza for three years in exchange for ending her hunger strike.

The deal has been criticized by rights groups and the Palestinian prisoners affairs ministry, which said she had been forced to accept the arrangement.

But in a statement released on Sunday through her lawyer Jawad Bulus, Shalabi insisted she had agreed to the deal voluntarily.

""To my dear family and my people and all the free people in the world, I thank you for your efforts and I appreciate everything you did for me and for the prisoners,"" she said.

""I hope that you will understand my position and my decision, which was taken freely.

""I chose to be transported to Gaza, which is half the homeland, and to be with my family and people there for three years,"" she said.

""After that I will go back to my home in Jenin and to my family. I hope that my decision will be respected and that we will continue to support together those who are fighting their battles for the homeland and for the prisoners.""

Palestinian prisoners group Addameer and Israel's Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, both of which worked on Shalabi's case, expressed concern about the deal in a joint statement on Sunday.

They noted that their officials, as well as Shalabi's relatives, were denied access to her during the final days of her hunger strike.

And they warned that ""aspects"" of the deal ""are fundamentally at odds with international law.

""With no guarantees that she or her family will be permitted to travel, her expulsion could essentially become an extension of her previous isolation from her home and family while in prison.""

Shalabi's action was inspired by a hunger strike by another Palestinian prisoner, Khader Adnan, who was also protesting against his administrative detention.

Israeli administrative detention orders allow a court to order an individual to be detained for periods of up to six months at a time.

Adnan refused food for 66 days, agreeing only to end his hunger strike after a deal was struck ensuring he would be released at the end of his four-month term.

In the wake of his hunger strike, dozens more Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails have launched similar protests, Palestinian and Israeli officials say."

MOSCOW (AP) — 18 protesters, including members of the punk provocateur band Pussy Riot, have been detained in Moscow after spending the night near the Red Square.

Pussy Riot member Maria Alekhina said on Twitter that she and other protesters who stayed the night near the famous Moscow landmark were detained by police early Wednesday.

Activists at the OVD Info group said 18 people were taken to a nearby police station.

A few thousand people rallied outside the Red Square on Tuesday in the boldest anti-government demonstration in years to protest against the court conviction of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and his brother. Police allowed the protesters to stay for about two hours before dispersing the crowd.

OVD Info said over 200 people were also arrested on Tuesday although many have been released."
852|Senator headlines Passover getaway|"JTA — Imagine your ideal Passover getaway. What would it include? Sandy beaches? Emerald green fairways? Kosher haute cuisine? Sen. Ted Cruz?

If the Prime Hospitality Group is any judge, you’ll want all of those things. Especially the last one.

Politico is reporting that the Prime Group, which specializes in offering lavish getaways for religiously observant Jews, is billing the firebrand Texas senator as a prime attraction for its 2015 Passover packages. Prime lists Cruz as a featured speaker for vacationers at high-end destinations including Aspen, Colo.; Westlake Village and Monach Beach, Calif.; and Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, alongside prominent rabbis such as Jonathan Sacks and Marvin Hier, and top communal officials like Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations Executive Vice Chairman Malcolm Hoenlein.

A Cruz adviser told Politico that the senator would only be speaking once, at Monarch Beach, suggesting that “well-meaning program organizers overstated his participation.” But the fact that Prime Group is eager, or even over-eager, to tout Cruz to its well-heeled, kosher-observant clientele suggests that Cruz is successfully carving out a niche for himself in the Jewish world, and that, in turn could have major repercussions for the 2016 presidential race.

The National Review has reported that Cruz’s strategy for 2016 is to focus his efforts to win over the conservative base, millennials, Hispanics and Jews. To the latter end, Cruz has worked assiduously to court Jewish power brokers. In a recent trip to New York, Cruz met with heavy hitters that included casino magnate and major GOP funder Sheldon Adelson, former Presidents Conference Chair Mort Zuckerman, and philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, and spoke at an awards dinner for the Zionist Organization of America. He has also brought his staunch pro-Israel rhetoric to less friendly venues, as when he was booed off the stage at a September gala to support Mideast Christians. (A number of conservative commentators suggested that Cruz may have cynically picked the fight to draw attention.)

Plenty of political observers have questioned whether Cruz’s strategy is realistic, on a number of levels. In terms of Jews, Cruz’s hardline pro-Israel stance is unlikely to endear him to the majority of Jewish voters, who have supported President Obama by wide margins and who may find Cruz’s conservative views on abortion, gay rights, and other issues anathema.

But if he can woo prominent donors and activists to his side, they can move substantial organizational muscle and —perhaps more importantly — money in his direction. Judging by these marketing materials, he seems to be establishing a prime beachhead."
853|98% pass rate for IEB Matriculants|"From left, Michael Davies, Zayan Daya, Nicholas Cowen, Robert Brinkmann from St John's College pose for a photograph as the IEB 2014 matric results are released. Picture supplied

The national pass rate for candidates who wrote the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) National Senior Certificate (NSC) this year, dropped slightly to 98.38%, compared to last year’s pass rate of 98.56%.

A total of 9 976 full time and 475 part time candidates from 191 schools across the country and in Mozambique, Namibia and Swaziland, wrote the IEB examinations in November.

This year saw an increase of 396 learners who wrote the IEB examination, compared with 2013, due to 7 new institutions that have joined the IEB as well as an increase in learner numbers at existing schools.

IEB CEO Anne Oberholzer said in a statement that 85.45% of candidates passed with university exemption.

Among the top performers regarding number of distinctions are Daniel Erasumus (St John’s College) with 11 distinctions and Chloé Kikillus (Saheti) with 10. Saheti’s George Cambanis, Claudia Osato and Eleanore Angeliniadis, as well as and Aashish Diayar (St John’s) all walked away with 9 As.

Gauteng had the highest number of pupils who wrote the IEB exam, with 5423 at 91 schools, followed by KwaZulu-Natal with 1909 pupils at 32 schools.

Oberholzer said: “Recent events in the history of our democracy has shown that our young people, who are about to assume their position as active citizens in our country, must be people who understand the realities of daily living in South Africa, have the ability to play an active role in addressing these realities and have the courage to speak up and act when they see the rights and freedoms, guaranteed in the Constitution, being undermined.

“Education therefore is so much more than the achievement of good results in the NSC examinations.

“While this is a very important personal milestone and has a significant impact on shaping one’s future, the key role of education is to provide young people with the capabilities beyond academic prowess that make them rounded citizens who engage constructively and meaningfully with their world.”"

I vote, and I think it's important. I also respect the right of those who choose not to. But your point of ""And those parties, once again, received a clear mandate, whether they choose to acknowledge it or not, from those ""voters"" who simply failed to show up and participate in the current electoral system."" They choose not to acknowledge it. ""Landslide!"" ""Rejection of Obama!"" ""Republican Wave!"" are just window dressing at the funeral of the American republic.

So NOT VOTING is ""a vote... either in favor of the way things are going, or against a two party system that has failed."" Put another way, in many cases ""not voting"" means something to the person boycotting it, but the ""message"" conveyed covers the entire spectrum. Kind of like mailing a blank piece of paper. The effect is very real, however. Every election our opportunity to effectively participate in our country diminishes. This will, of course, only feed the dynamic of nonparticipation.

Just how the traditional lame excuse for not voting becomes a justification in anyone's mind borders on insanity.

Speaking of Henry Wallace here is one quote that seems applicable and explains the ""victory"" that the conservatives have earned by selling the narrative that votes don't matter and getting the majority of Americans to opt/tune out. “The American fascist would prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of information. With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money and more power.

They claim to be superpatriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjugation” VP Henry Wallace. Brad I get your point that the D's have not ""earned"" the attention/support of the working man/woman but please tell me how that is possible when the Plutocracy has firm control of the Media? I personally know older people who were life long D's and liberals who have been brain washed by fox News. So please tell me how short of a massive door to door education campaign can the D's earn anything when the message on the other side is so loud and persistent?

StumptownHero @ 4: Of course, I concur with the excellent quote from Wallace (we ran same back in 2010) and your points about Fox and the RW echo chamber etc.. That said, I received literally hundreds of emails this season from the DCCC. Every single one shamelessly begged for money. Not one that I noticed actually told me what Democrats planned to do if they were elected to a House or Senate majority with that money. They told me that ""Boehner was going to win!!!"" if I didn't fork over money (I didn't), but that was about it. Aside from rare exceptions like Elizabeth Warren who would go on TV and say something like ""elect us and we will end the obscene profits the U.S. makes from loan-sharking money to students to go to college,"" I have no idea what the Democrats were promising to do if they were elected to power. Do you? I know what they were against, and I vaguely know what sort of things they care about and were not able to carry out up to now, but they failed to offer a compelling reason for voters to vote FOR them. And I pay attention to this stuff. When the Rs took over the House in 1994 they presented a ""Contract With America"". It made 10 (fairly despicable, but that's a different issue) promises, telling the electorate exactly what they promised to do once in power. It gave the electorate something to vote FOR. Americans --- and this was prior to the ridiculous gerrymandering of 2010 --- voted for them in droves. In 2006, Democrats promised to get us out of Iraq and hold Dubya accountable (never mind if they did, that's what they offered to the electorate as a reason to vote FOR them.) In 2008, Barack Obama promised to get out of Iraq, institute economic reforms amidst global disaster and assure health care coverage to millions of Americans. Granted, a ham sandwich could have defeated almost any Republican Presidential candidate in 2008, but Americans were given something (and someone) to vote FOR --- and they did. I hear your message in regard the difficulty of getting the message out to the electorate on an uneven, bastardized playing field. But there has to be a message first, in order to get it out, no matter the playing field. If you can tell me what the Democrats had promised to do for the American people had they been granted majorities to govern in both chambers this year, I'd love to hear it. So, it seems, would the bulk of the American electorate. Oh, and it also would have helped if they'd worked harder to actually do many of those things they previously had promised the American people, like holding Dubya and friends accountable, etc.

Gay marriage - GOP on the wrong side of history and public opinion Drug War - GOP on the wrong side of history and public opinion Economics/Taxes/Inequality - GOP *MASSIVELY* on the wrong side of history and public opinion.

Thanks for this, Brad.-

I'm the first person to say that I think people should vote, if only because when they don't, that's one less vote that bad guys need to steal. Now at least I have a rationale TO vote. Next problem--is there going to be someone to vote FOR in 2016(should the planet still be here)? Cuz please, don't nobody expect me to vote for Hillary, she's a nightmare, even if it would be fun to see a woman elected Pres. My argument for not voting(if one happens to not want to) still goes something like this--the current system is so very much rigged for ever-continuing dysfunction and malfeasance by the oligarchy/plutocracy. We're on the clock as far as needing to get anywhere near real on climate change and other related socio-economic issues. Since--1.there is so little hope that appropriate, timely change will come from the top down. And since--2. it seems that our best shot(as long as it appears to be)for appropriate and timely change will probably come from an engaged populace finally becoming energized in a big and continuous way. And since--3. the Republicans may be more efficient at getting us energized cuz their shit has NOT EVEN THE PRETENSE of appearing sane or helpful in any way(other than in their continuing duplicity filled, disinformation campaigns). --Maybe--4. the most effective way to bring about the hail mary change we so desperately need--an enraged/engaged populace that won't let up-- on so many fronts is to let the Repubs win. This strategy has the added benefits of--1. not having to submit/compromise your sacred right to vote to the lesser of two evils choice, which sucks so bad and is all too often the only choice. And 2. satisfies some childish sense of vindictiveness towards all those people who refuse yesterday, today, and every day to listen to our very real and sensible urgency about the need to change our voting system to a transparent, trustworthy one. There's no way, short of prescience, to suss this idea out, but what we been doin' don't seem to be working all that well. I'm not saying I'm not gonna vote. I'm saying it's tempting for the reasons sited.

Although I understand your point, Brad, I disagree. A vote is a vote and not voting is not a vote. Does not voting send a message yes, and you are right on that point. An example, even if you disagree with the Democrats, but hate the Republicans even more, you should vote for the Democratic candidate. Why? Because if everyone did this, and looking at demographics of the actual population of the United States, we would end up with about 30% voting for Republicans, maybe 40% and either 70% or 60% voting for the Democrats. This would create a sea change in our politics and would likely drive the Republicans down to 25% or 30% in the next election as it would become clear that Democrats are willing to govern and Republicans just know how to lower taxes and get rid of government. At the level of 25 or 30% for the Republican Party, a 3rd party candidate becomes viable. Such as a Green party candidate, a Socialist or even a Libertarian. Then they voters would have an even better choice then. But the non-voters are not willing to even see this and so are causing our country to go down the tubes even quicker.

Jim at #3 said, ""Just how the traditional lame excuse for not voting becomes a justification in anyone's mind borders on insanity."" So, if I can look at the political scene and see on one hand center-right authoritarian murderers and war criminals who tout their failures as though they were successes, and on the other hand center-right authoritarian murderers and war criminals who run from their successes as though they were failures, I'm insane not to vote for one or the other? I disagree with Brad that not voting can be a vote for the status quo. Citizens who like the way things are going go out and vote for the incumbents. There is a concept in business that employees rise to the level of their incompetence. As long as they are successful at their jobs, people get promoted; once they reach a position which exceeds their skills, they no longer rise. Consequently, there is a risk of a company promoting all its most competent people only to find that no one can do his or her job. Not voting is how a citizen qua board member says, ""I think our most profitable option is to continue our search."" Jim also said, ""As for the bulk of non voters, they are simply too ignorant to engage in reasoned judgment."" He failed to elaborate with evidence that active voters are better informed or more rational, particularly necessary given their continued tendency to vote for disingenuous (albeit successful) politicking and overwhelmingly shitty governance.

I completely agree with you that the D's have failed to talk ""to"" the lower and middle classes. They have always had a hard time clearly communicating the ideas on the liberal buffet table to an electorate that is unengaged and distracted by the demands of the survival treadmill. The R's main message of ""less government"" is easy to convey in all types of communications, and more important, easy to cognitively process even though it is a meaningless concept when applied to the responsibilities of GOVERNING! Add on the emotionally driven Gun Nuts and the tribalism of the Religious groups and you have a coalition that needs to hear only three simple messages from their candidates to get their full and enthusiastic support. Since our L$M is little more than tabloid's and even on network news serious issues are simmered down to 30 seconds stories and conveyed in sound bites how can any group get the attention of the electorate? What I am saying is that even if the D's could develop a coherent strategy I don't think the current structure of the media would permit it to be communicated especially if that narrative threaten their control of the message like campaign finance reform which would cut them off from the advertising pig trough. Maybe after the 2022 reapportionment the D's can retake control of the US House and overturn Citizens United but until then the only answer I can see making a difference on participation rates is a massive door to door campaign to communicate a platform that talks to the ""average"" American. Without that Face to Face education the D's will not be able to ""get' the average American's attention. Your work on the Radio and Tee Vee helps but it is a small, but important, voice in the discussion.

StumptownHero @ 13: I generally agree with your broad assessment, but want to respond to a point or two here... the D's have failed to talk ""to"" the lower and middle classes. They have always had a hard time clearly communicating the ideas on the liberal buffet table to an electorate that is unengaged and distracted by the demands of the survival treadmill. Yes, but they could at least try! What I am saying is that even if the D's could develop a coherent strategy I don't think the current structure of the media would permit it to be communicated especially if that narrative threaten their control of the message like campaign finance reform which would cut them off from the advertising pig trough. I generally agree with your point there, in that the playing field is vastly tilted against Ds, particularly on the public airwaves which are so crucial to any messaging. On the other hand, two points: 1) The Ds have rolled over in the fight for the public airwaves for years, contending that it's the Internet that matters now, not the public airwaves. (That's why they fight for Net Neutrality and completely ignore issues like the FCC's refusal to enforce laws --- which still exist! --- meant to prevent the corporate Rightwing takeover of our publicly owned airwaves.) And 2) The Ds did communicate with me every day --- like 5 times a day! --- through their idiotic DCCC emails begging for money in the most embarrassing of ways. Not once, to my recollection, did they bother to explain why I should vote FOR them in those emails. They succeeded in receiving my attention --- and that of millions of others --- many times a day for several months before the election through those endless shameful pleas and, yet, did absolutely nothing to make their case when they had that attention. So I agree the playing field is tilted against them. But even where it should work in their favor or where they had the opportunity to get a message across, they chose to squander the opportunity to present a message as to why anybody should vote FOR them, other than ""Hey, we're not as bad as those other guys! So give us some money now or Boehner will win!""

855|Benjamin Netanyahu lauds US, Australia for efforts to reject Palestinian UN bid|"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday lauded the US and Australia for voting against the Palestinian UN Security Council draft resolution on Tuesday, and praised Rwanda and Nigeria for abstaining.



""I want to express appreciation and gratitude to the United States and Australia, as well as special appreciation to the President of Rwanda, my friend Paul Kagame, and to the President of Nigeria, my friend Goodluck Jonathan,” Netanyahu said when he arrived Wednesday morning to vote in the Likud primary.



“I spoke with both of them, they promised me personally that they would not support this decision, and they stood by their words. That is what tipped the scales,"" he added.



The Palestinian resolution calling for a full Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 lines by 2017, and the establishment of a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital, did not muster the necessary nine votes Tuesday in the Security Council.



Earlier Wednesday, Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said the Palestinian failure to get their statehood resolution passed Wednesday in the UN Security Council should teach them that provocations and attempts to unilaterally impose conditions on Israel will lead them nowhere.



“The Palestinian disregard for important countries in the international arena, first and foremost the US, stems from the backing they get form some of the states in Europe,” he said, in an obvious reference to the “for” votes cast by France and Luxembourg.



“Every state that truly wants to move an arrangement forward needs to act responsibly and make clear to the Palestinians that decisions are only made around the negotiating table,” Liberman said.



While France and Luxembourg voted for the Palestinian resolution, two other EU countries – Britain and Lithuania – abstained, illustrating the wide differences on the Mideast that exist inside the 28-state EU.



Liberman praised his ministry for the work it did to thwart the resolution, the second time in three years that Israel dodged a bullet on this issue in the Security Council, and cited Israel's concentrated diplomatic efforts in Africa, the far East and central Europe. In 2011 the Palestinians failed in their attempt to win full UN statehood recognition in the UN.



In addition to the United States, Australia voted against the resolution on Tuesday. Britain, Lithuania, South Korea, and two of the three African states on the Security Council – Rwanda and Nigeria – all abstained, depriving the Palestinians of their nine votes needed to pass the resolution and force a US veto.



Meanwhile, Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz expressed his criticism of the draft Palestinian statehood bid, despite its failure to pass the Security Council vote.



""The Palestinian failure to secure a vote in the UN Security Council does not mitigate the Palestinian Authorities hostile and unilateral political offensive against Israel,"" he charged a day after the vote.



Steinitz said it was ""a worrying sign"" that France and Britain - two of Israel's allies - supported the resolution or abstained from the vote on it.



Former Israeli Ambassador to the US Michael Oren also came out against the Palestinian move, saying its unilateral attempt to push a statehood motion through an international body proved that the PA did not seek to negotiate peace with Israel.



""The Palestinian leadership proved once again that its not interested in peace with its attempt to force a state on us, via the UN,"" said Oren, who is planning to run in the March elections on the new Koolanu party ballot.

856|UN rejects Palestinian bid to impose occupation deadline. Next tactic? International Criminal Court|"RAMALLAH, Palestinian Territory • Palestinian leaders will meet Wednesday to plan their next steps after the UN Security Council rejected a resolution to end Israel’s occupation and could set a date for applying to join the International Criminal Court, Palestinian officials said.

The UN vote Tuesday against the Palestinian bid, which called for the Israeli occupation to end within three years, was a blow to an Arab campaign for international action to bring about an independent Palestinian state.

The Palestinians long have vowed to join the International Criminal Court to press charges against Israel for alleged war crimes, though their membership could expose the Palestinians to similar accusations.

Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said officials would hold a “very serious meeting” Wednesday and could set a date for applying for membership to the court and other international agencies.

“There will be no more waiting, no more hesitation, no more slowdown,” Erekat said. “We are going to meet and make decisions.”

The Palestinian leadership in the West Bank has pursued a more confrontational approach toward Israel and the United States by seeking broader international recognition for a Palestinian state. In 2012, the UN accepted Palestine as a non-member observer state.

The Palestinians’ next step was the UN bid to set a timetable for an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and east Jerusalem, lands seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

The United States, Israel’s closest ally, and Australia voted against Tuesday’s UN resolution. The U.S. has called for negotiations rather than an imposed timetable.

“I want to express my appreciation and gratitude to the U.S. and Australia,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday. He said he also received assurances from the Rwandan and Nigerian presidents that they would not support the resolution.

“They stood by their words and this is what tipped the scales,” Netanyahu said.

France and Luxembourg were among countries that voted in favour of the resolution, reflecting growing impatience, especially in Europe, over the lack of progress in more than two decades of on-again off-again peace talks.

Also Wednesday, two masked assailants threw a firebomb into a Palestinian home in a suspected Israeli attack in the southern West Bank village of Khirbet al-Karmil, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The attack caused no casualties and the word “revenge” in Hebrew was found scrawled nearby, she said.

The attack comes after a firebomb attack last week on a car belonging to Jewish settlers in the West Bank. A young Israeli girl suffered serious burns and her father was lightly wounded in the attack.

Israel says it arrested Palestinians who confessed to throwing the firebomb."
857|Emeril Lagasse's former top chef buys Frankie and Johnny's|"David McCelvey took over Frankie and Johnny's on Nov. 1. The chef, who once helmed the kitchens at NOLA, Emeril's and Emeril's Delmonico, knew customers wouldn't accept many tweaks at the Uptown neighborhood joint. But he didn't realize how sensitive they would be.

""I changed one thing,"" he said, ""the meat on the hamburger steak.""

Customers started quizzing McCelvey immediately on what was different. He went back to the old way of doing things.

""It's one of the most true, authentic New Orleans restaurants around,"" McCelvey said. ""It's a restaurant for everybody, and it kind of belongs to the city.""

McCelvey, who's lived in New Orleans for 22 years, most recently spent five years as Emeril Lagasse's vice president of operations.

At Frankie and Johnny's, McCelvey is guided by the example of his pal, chef Horst Pfeifer. After buying Middendorf's, famous for thin-cut catfish, Pfeifer improved the Manchac restaurant but didn't alter it.

""He was selfless in his approach,"" McCelvey said.

New items will pop up on Frankie and Johnny's menu, such as more salads, grilled fish and pasta dishes.

""I want to keep all the good things,"" McCelvey said. ""Our goal and our mission is to be the best neighborhood restaurant in the city.""

He also kept the entire staff.

""To me they're as important to the place as anything,"" he said.

For McCelvey, to own a restaurant like Frankie and Johnny's means he's responsible for a piece of New Orleans history.

The Morreale family started Frankie and Johnny's more than 70 years ago. They ran the restaurant until the 1980s. For decades, the Cortello family operated the business. In 2013, Anthony Macaluso bought the business and then sold it to McCelvey this year.

The Morreale family still owns Frankie and Johnny's building.

""The place opened in 1942. That's when America entered the war in Europe,"" he said. ""If you think of all the things that happened, and this place has just cruised along serving crawfish and boiled shrimp.""

860|Reports: Indonesia may have found missing AirAsia flight|"Reports: Indonesia may have found missing AirAsia flight Posted: Saturday, December 27, 2014 11:57 PM EST Updated: Monday, March 30, 2015 3:08 AM EDT

Family members of passengers on the AirAsia airliner await news on the search for the jet. (Source: CNN)

(RNN) - Indonesia may have found Flight 8501, CNN reports. ?Sonar may have located the AirAsia plane at the bottom of the Java Sea.



It is not clear yet whether the plane is intact or broken in pieces.



On Tuesday, AirAsia confirmed that debris found by rescue teams in the Java Sea belongs to the company's airliner, drawing the more than two day hunt for the plane to a close.

Search and rescue teams were lowered from helicopters into the seas where they gathered bodies and wreckage from the water. Six bodies were recovered, including a woman in a flight attendant uniform, officials said.

Family members of passengers onboard the airliner were called to meet with officials at the search headquarters in Surabaya, Indonesia, CNN reported.

The leader of AirAsia responded to the news.

""My heart is filled with sadness for all the families involved in QZ 8501,"" AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted on Tuesday. ""On behalf of AirAsia my condolences to all. Words cannot express how sorry I am. I am rushing to Surabaya. Whatever we can do at Airasia we will be doing.""

Flight 8501 was missing for more than two days.

The AirAsia plane lost contact with air traffic control after taking off from Surabaya heading toward Singapore Sunday, Dec. 28 local time.

The Airbus A320-200 was carrying 162 people - 155 passengers and seven crew members.

The majority of the passengers, 155, were from Indonesia. Three people from South Korean and one passenger each from Singapore, France, the United Kingdom and Malaysia were on the flight.



AirAsia said the plane was requesting deviation from its submitted flight path due to weather concerns before communication was lost.

The airline reported the captain in command had 6,100 flying hours with AirAsia on the Airbus A320, and more than 20,000 flying hours overall. The first officer a total of 2,275 flying hours. The plane underwent its last scheduled maintenance in November.

The disappearance of the AirAsia flight brings echoes of the Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 that similarly lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday, March 8, 2014. No debris from the plane has been found, despite months of extensive searches. Authorities believe the plane crashed in the south Indian Ocean.

Another Malaysia Airlines flight, MH17, was shot out of the sky near the Ukraine/Russia border in July. Russian separatists are believed to have been behind the attack on the flight, heading for Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam."
861|Here s hoping New Year brings better news than the old year|"Here’s hoping New Year brings better news than the old year



Don McKee slideshow

Here’s hoping 2015 brings better news than did 2014, especially with respect to the unrest and divisiveness visited upon our country in the wake of fatal encounters with police officers in Missouri, New York and other places.It’s a tradition to pick the top news stories of the year, an exercise that can be more subjective than objective. With that caveat, my choice for the top story in Georgia in 2014 is the Republican sweep in the general election — coming after various polls had indicated tight races or outright victories by Democrats trying for a resurgence in this now thoroughly Red state.Of all the elections stories, the one that stands out as the top event is David Perdue’s winning the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Saxby Chambliss. Perdue, cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue, came out of nowhere politically, having never run for office and presumptively relegated to the “David who?” category of candidates. But he proved to be every bit as savvy in politics as he was in business. Who would have thought this unknown — despite his notable success in running Dollar General, Reebok and other major enterprises — could defeat three Congressmen in the primaries and a strong Democrat, Michele Nunn, in the general election?However, there was ample evidence of his abilities in his resume, starting with his first jobs as warehouse and construction worker — and his education at Georgia Tech where he earned a BS in industrial engineering and an MS in operations research. Parenthetically, over the years I have been impressed with engineers running businesses, a prime example being the late Roberto Goizueta, a Yale chemical engineering graduate who became the highly successful CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.Perdue, who turned 65 on Dec. 10, will take office with the new Republican majority in the Senate on Jan. 3, and he hopes to use his business acumen in this new realm of politics. He has a key appointment to the Budget Committee, giving him the opportunity to make a difference. On that point he says, “Our full blown fiscal crisis is what pulled me into the Senate. I will work every day to make a difference and fight for the future of our kids and grand kids. I will act with urgency on the Budget Committee to tackle our nation’s debt crisis. I look forward to bringing my business experience to the Senate to help advance commonsense solutions.”Doing something positive on the budget will be easy compared to Perdue’s pledge to seek term limits. He proposes no more than two terms in the Senate and six terms in the House for a maximum of 12 years total. He has said, “I will not serve any longer than two terms.”Here’s hoping he’s successful on the Budget Committee (he’s also on Foreign Relations, Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry, Aging and Judiciary committees) and that the GOP-ruled Senate will make cuts in spending, taxes and regulations, undo Obamacare — and make this a really Happy New Year!"
862|US Blasts Cuba Over Detention of Dissident Activists Planning Rally|"MOSCOW, December 31 (Sputnik) — The US State Department issued a strongly worded statement on Tuesday which was critical of the Cuban government's arrest of dissident activists ahead of a planned political rally in the country's main square.

The statement on the Department's website, released Tuesday, notes: ""We strongly condemn the Cuban government's continued harassment and repeated use of arbitrary detention, at times with violence, to silence critics, disrupt peaceful assembly and freedom [of] expression, and intimidate citizens.""

The statement adds that ""the United States will continue to press the Cuban government to uphold its international obligations and to respect the rights of Cubans to peacefully assemble and express their ideas and opinions.""

Roughly 12 Cuban opposition activists are said to have been arrested by police on Tuesday morning, with several more effectively placed under house arrest, according to Elizardo Sanchez, the head of a rights group that monitors such detentions in Cuba. Other opposition activists have released social media posts noting that they had been detained.

The recent spate of detentions was aimed at preventing an open mic protest event which had been planned to take place in Havana's Revolution Square on Tuesday afternoon. The event, entitled #YoTambienExijo, meaning ""#IAlsoDemand"", was aimed at giving activists one minute to express their views on the island nation's future.

The event was organized by Tania Bruguera, an artist who had been living in New York for the past three years before returning to Cuba on December 26 to begin planning the rally. Bruguera was detained ahead of the protest action along with Yaoni Sanchez, a well-known dissident blogger, and Reinaldo Escobar, who runs a dissident website known as 14ymedio.com, the International Business Times explained. The Guardian has noted that some of the activists had earlier noted that the US had eased pressure on the island nation prematurely, without securing human rights concessions.

Without its leaders, the #IAlsoDemand event, which gathered about 15 people flanked by reporters with television cameras, was deemed a flop. A parallel event held in downtown Miami in front of the Freedom Tower gathered a group of about 50 Miami Cubans, France 24 said.

The Cuban government called the event a ""political provocation"". The country's National Mixed Media Arts Council refused to support the rally, saying that it would negatively affect public opinion at a time of improving relations between Cuba and the United States. Meanwhile, the Cuban Union of Artists and Writers stated that Bruguera was a ""CIA agent"" and an 'opportunist' seeking attention, NBC News explained.

US Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson tweeted on Tuesday that ""freedom of expression remains [the] core of US policy on #Cuba; we support activists exercising those rights and condemn today's detention."" Jacobson is set to lead the US delegation to Cuba next month, and is charged with formalizing the process of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries announced earlier this month.

Earlier, Cuban President Raul Castro told the country's parliament that the United States must respect Cuba's decision to maintain its socialist choice. ""In the same way that we have never demanded that the United States change its political system, we will demand respect for ours,"" Castro said at the close of the Cuban parliament's 2014 session."
863|2-Year-Old Accidentally Kills His Mom in Idaho Wal-Mart|"HAYDEN, Idaho -- A 2-year-old boy accidentally shot and killed a woman after he reached into her purse at a northern Idaho Wal-Mart and her concealed gun fired, authorities said Tuesday.

The woman was shopping with several children, and it is unclear how they are related, Kootenai County sheriff's spokesman Stu Miller said. Authorities originally said the boy was the woman's son.

The woman, whose identity was not released, had a concealed weapons permit.

Miller said the shooting was accidental and occurred in the Wal-Mart in Hayden, Idaho, a town about 40 miles northeast of Spokane, Washington.

The woman and the children were in the back of the store near the electronics area when the shooting occurred, authorities said.

KREM-TV reports that witnesses and video surveillance from the store helped deputies determine the shooting was accidental.

The store closed after the shooting and was not expected to reopen until Wednesday morning.

Hayden is a politically conservative town of about 9,000 people just north of Coeur d'Alene in Idaho's northern panhandle."
864|10 New Year's resolutions you can only make if you're from Cambridge|"Sorted out your New Year's resolutions yet? The annual pledge to get fit, cycle to work (even in the rain), see friends more often, or simply resolve not to make resolutions because they've always been ditched by January 9 anyway.

Well here are 10 pledges only Cambridge people can make.

1. Give up your corporate coffee chain habit

Cambridge is full of brilliant independent coffee shops and cafes. Make this year the one where you enjoy tea and cake at Hot Numbers, Afternoon Tease and CB1, to name just a few, instead.

2. Learn to appreciate the Snowy Farr statue

Yes we know it looks like a bunch of jelly beans with some mice on top but take a step back and see it as a colourful tribute to a man who made you smile whenever you went past.

3. Have drinks on top of Varsity at sunset

One of Cambridge's best kept secrets. The roof terrace of the Varsity Hotel has amazing views over the city. It's the perfect spot for sitting with a drink and watching the sun go down over the rooftops.

4. Take part in Bridge the Gap

If you’ve ever wanted to see what’s behind the college gates, then Bridge the Gap is a must. It’s a 5 mile walk around Cambridge, weaving through college grounds and all in a good cause, raising money for local charities.

5. Get on your bike (or hire one)

We live in a beautiful city and the fastest way to get around it is by bike. If you’ve moaned about your commute and a friend has replied ‘why don’t you cycle?’ then maybe 2015 is the year to give two wheels a try and see if pedal-power is for you. You don’t need to wear lycra to give it a go.

6. Go to Twilight at the Museums

How many Cambridge museums have you been to? Next month you can see them in a whole new light. Thirteen venues will open their doors after dark as part of Twilight at the Museums. If you haven’t been, it’s a magical experience.

7. Go to LodeStar Festival

Cambridge has a really good music scene with plenty of festivals on it’s doorstep from Cambridge Folk Festival to Latitude. If you’re looking to go to your first one, give LodeStar a try. Strung with twinkling fairy-lights, it's super safe, ridiculously chilled out and makes perfect sense for families.

8. Get Arts Picturehouse membership

Many people were horrified at the thought Cambridge could lose the Picturehouse. Thankfully, sense has prevailed. Celebrate having a brilliant cinema in the middle of town by becoming a member and enjoy everything from the latest blockbusters to classics and of course, the excellent Cambridge Film Festival.

9. Head to Grantchester

It’s the village everyone’s talking about after its primetime slot on ITV. While it’s now famous for its dishy fictional vicar, a visit to Grantchester is the perfect day out. There’s a lovely walk out from Cambridge, across the meadows to the village, letting you indulge in tea at The Orchard (pictured) afterwards.

10. Stop moaning about the Guided Bus

Come on, enough now. It’s been running successfully since 2011. OK, it needs repairs, cost more than was expected and every now and again some idiot tries to drive along it but the system works and there’s no going back. It’s time to put this argument to bed."
865|7 New Brunswick political stories to watch in 2015|"The year that’s drawing to an end marked a turning point in New Brunswick politics, with David Alward’s Progressive Conservative government losing power to Brian Gallant’s Liberals.

But many of the implications of that change will only become clear in 2015.

Here are seven questions about the political scene that may be answered in the coming year.

1. What will be the impact of the fracking moratorium?

Gallant introduced his hydraulic fracturing moratorium bill on the second-last day of the legislature before the Christmas break and MLAs will return in February to pass it.

Premier Brian Gallant and Energy Minister Donald Arseneault announced a hydraulic fracturing moratorium in December. (CBC)

​The first impact could be in Penobsquis, where Corridor Resources extracts shale gas to power the nearby PotashCorp mine, where 450 people work.

The fracking moratorium will prevent Corridor from fracking new wells or re-fracking existing ones.

It’s not clear how long existing wells can supply gas to the mine or what alternatives PotashCrop has.

“It could have a serious impact on our costs,” the company said in a statement.

2. Will the Gallant government try to change the forestry plan?

In opposition, the Liberals questioned whether the Crown forestry plan, which allows higher levels of logging in publicly owned forests, was based on sound science.

Natural Resources Minister Denis Landry said he will know early in 2015 whether any changes will be made to the Crown forestry policy. (CBC)

​Now, though, they must weigh whether changes would amount to breaking the contracts signed with J.D. Irving Ltd. and others.

“We don’t want to go fight in court with those big corporations,” Natural Resources Minister Denis Landry said.

“We’ll see if there are adjustments to be made and then we’ll see if they agree with them or not.”

3. How high — or low — will the deficit go?

Finance Minister Roger Melanson will release his first full budget in 2015. (CBC)

​The Liberals said during the campaign that it wasn’t realistic to push for a balanced budget as quickly as the Tories were promising.

Instead, they’ve pledged $150-million per year in infrastructure spending to create jobs, along with a major strategic review of government programs intended to reduce spending by $250 million annually, beginning in 2016-2017.

But some of those decisions will take shape in 2015, including what Finance Minister Roger Melanson calls an effort to “optimize” the number of schools in the province.

Where the numbers end up depends on all these factors--and many others beyond the government’s control.

4. Will pipeline diplomacy bear fruit?

Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and New Brunswick Premier Brian Gallant met on in November to discuss the Energy East pipeline project. (CBC)

​The fall of 2014 saw a flurry of meetings between premiers about the proposed Energy East pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Alberta to Saint John for export and, perhaps eventually, for refining at Irving Oil’s refinery.

There’s growing opposition to the project in Quebec. Though the premiers of Ontario, Alberta and New Brunswick seem determined to win support by trying to address environmental and First Nations objections.

Other wild cards include U.S. President Barack Obama’s looming decision on whether to allow the Keystone XL pipeline; a rejection would increase the impetus for Energy East.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been accused of not doing enough to mollify opponents by resisting emissions regulations.

5. Will Mother Nature wreak havoc again, including with the bottom line?

Wild weather isn’t just an inconvenience, or a danger, for New Brunswickers: it also has an impact on the provincial budget.

The last quarterly report by the Department of Finance projected that government spending will be $64 million higher than budgeted in 2014-15; of that overrun, $44 million is blamed on disaster assistance funding after post-tropical storm Arthur and road maintenance and repairs made necessary by other major weather events.

6. Will the Green Party eclipse the NDP ?

Green Party Leader David Coon won a seat in the legislature in 2014, giving his party greater prominence in provincial politics. (CBC)

​Two political parties are now laying claim to being the “third party” in New Brunswick politics. The NDP earned almost 13 per cent of the vote in September’s election, double what the Greens received.

But the NDP elected no MLAs, while Green Party Leader David Coon made a historic breakthrough by winning Fredericton South. That means more visibility.

The most recent poll by Corporate Research Associates suggested the Greens narrowing the gap with the NDP, though the movement was within the poll’s margin of error. Still, each party will be jockeying to become the left-wing alternative to the Liberals and PCs.

7. What will the federal campaign mean for New Brunswick?

​Canadians will go to the polls in October and in New Brunswick the Conservatives hope to hold or expand on the eight ridings out of 10 they now hold — their highest since Brian Mulroney’s PC landslide in 1984.

Some defeated provincial PCs may be looking to launch federal careers, while federal Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau’s recent musings about the Energy East pipeline’s lack of “social licence” could complicate any campaiging his provincial ally, Premier Brian Gallant, will do for federal Liberal candidates in this province."
866|Philadelphia should resist Marcellus 'energy hub' vision — NewsWorks|"In the near-freezing temperatures of a recent Friday morning, a group of over 100 Philadelphians gathered outside of the Drexel University student center. A sea of black-and-yellow warning signs trumpeted messages such as ""Dangerous investments ahead,"" ""Philly is not for sale,"" and ""Invest in people, not fossils.""

The demonstrators were speaking out against a newly public plan to turn Philadelphia into an ""energy hub."" Industry executives including Philadelphia Energy Solutions’ CEO Philip Rinaldi are aggressively backing a vision to send fracked gas from the nearby Marcellus Shale region directly to Philadelphia for processing.

If Philly became a site for processing natural gas and oil, Rinaldi’s story goes, the city could become a “hub” for international transport of fossil fuels, while also attracting petrol-chemical industries to use those fuels in factories. In an early step toward securing this plan, local fossil-fuel executives organized a closed conference at Drexel on Dec. 5 to build buy-in among global investors and industry leaders.

I was among those picketing outside the conference. Now is a key moment to show investors and industry leaders — as well as fellow Philadelphia residents — that the people who live, work and raise families in this city, the people who breathe the air and drink the water here, have different visions for the future of our home.

Proponents of the energy hub would like to convince us that, in order to have jobs, we must sacrifice our health. But we know the choice between jobs and health is a false one. Renewable and energy-efficiency sectors, clean and healthy industries, create 2 to 9 times as many jobs as coal, oil and gas for every $1 million contribution to GDP. We also know that the grave threat the energy hub poses to our community’s health is unacceptable. Three out of every 10 children living near the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery already has asthma. Increased disease in our children is incompatible with our vision for the future.

Proponents of the energy hub would like us to trust their projections that the Marcellus Shale will produce natural gas for 100 years. But we know that studies suggest the future supply of shale gas is extremely uncertain. We know the energy industry’s agenda is to continue profiting from fossil fuel reserves until they’re gone and communities are left with a starved economy and deteriorating health.

Unfortunately, examples are endless, from the stripped mountains of West Virginia to the 150 industrial facilities in the ""Cancer Alley"" of Louisiana. Consistently, dirty energy hubs condemn the surrounding communities to a life in a sacrifice zone.

The alternative to this energy-hub plan is right in front of our eyes: supporting clean work that creates vital and resilient communities. Together, the people in this city can envision a future with expanded mass transit, large-scale projects to repair aging infrastructure, urban agriculture and green spaces that buffer against the effects of climate change like hurricanes Irene and Sandy. This city could become a hub for renewable energy and for energy-efficiency jobs like home weatherization and retrofitting. These are the kinds of industries that both provide clean jobs and make our city a more resilient, healthy place to live.

Philadelphians are veterans in the fight against corporate control of the city. The assault on public education is just one example. As private interests have jockeyed for power, 23 schools are now closed, funds are mismanaged by charter schools, and two students have died because of a lack of nursing resources. This privatization agenda extends to stripping public ownership of utilities and expanding profits-first development that pushes low-income families out of their homes. In short, it means an increasing dismissal of democracy and people-first policies in every realm of government.

Standing up to the energy-hub plan is an extension of the work Philadelphians are doing all over the city to push for the real solutions we need for social and economic problems. Philadelphia Coalition Advocating for Public Schools has just launched a campaign for community schools. The Take Back Vacant Land campaign won a city land bank, and will continue to push for funding for low-income housing and land used for urban food security. The community of Eastwick is fighting to reclaim a community plagued by toxic industrial waste and flooding, by demanding neighborhood projects that create resiliency in the face of climate change.

We will resist the energy-hub plan in the good company of those in this city already fighting for a healthier, more vibrant future for Philadelphia.

870|Throwing money down the drain|"BELMOND, Iowa – It started as a way to keep pipes from freezing last winter, and now it’s leading to nearly a million gallons of water being wasted per month.

During last year’s long winter, many Belmond residents installed non metered taps to keep their pipes from freezing.

The city believes a large number of residents haven’t turned them off, and that’s costing the city around $600 a day in lost revenue.

Belmond’s Public Works Director, Mark Wicks, is pleading with residents to please turn the taps off.

“We’re paying for a brand new plant at the time, using debt service and we had to increase rates to pay for that. I hate to have to increase rates again, when we are losing that much revenue a day,” Dirks said.

The city had asked that taps were to be turned off in April. Dirks is proposing home inspections to check if any taps are still running."

MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT Dr Denis Lowe today dismissed suggestions he should resign if the island’s garbage-collection problems persist.

872|Leelah Alcorn: Transgender teen writes suicide note, steps into traffic|"KINGS MILLS, Ohio — A 17-year-old transgendered teen’s death has received national attention, in part due to a suicide note she wrote online, pleading for others to “fix society.”

According to WLWT, Leelah Alcorn, 17, was born Joshua Alcorn. On Sunday morning she was hit by a tractor-trailer traveling on the interstate.

Before her death, Leelah wrote a suicide note and posted it on Tumbler.

In the detailed note, she said she felt “like a girl trapped in a boy’s body” since she was four years old. Leelah said when she turned 14, she discovered the meaning of transgender and “cried of happiness.”

But she also discussed her parents’ disappointment and unwillingness to accept her, and wrote that they took her to Christian therapists.

People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.”“There’s no winning,” Leelah wrote. “There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.”

“So they took me out of public school, took away my laptop and phone, and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media, completely isolating me from my friends. This was probably the part of my life when I was the most depressed, and I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. I was completely alone for 5 months. No friends, no support, no love. Just my parent’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness.”

Leelah said the only way she would ever rest in peace is if one day transgender people “aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated with valid feelings and human rights.”

She ended by saying, “My death needs to mean something. Fix society. Please.”

Leelah’s friends and even strangers across the country have taken to Twitter and Facebook, creating a hashtag, #LeelahAlcorn, to raise awareness of her life and the transgender community.

A Facebook group has been created to offer support and community."

The body of a missing Maryland toddler was found in a creek in Ohio on New Year's Eve, the same day the child’s mother was charged for his disappearance in a bizarre case that spans several weeks.

The body of what could be a missing Maryland toddler was found in an Ohio creek on New Year's Eve, the same day the child's mother was charged for his disappearance in a bizarre case that spans several weeks, the Associated Press reported.



Searchers in the city of Columbus found what is likely the body of 14-month-old Cameron Beckford in Big Walnut Creek on the city's east side.



""Everything points to the fact that this is going to be the child we were looking for,"" Sergeant Rich Weiner, spokesman for the Columbus Police Department, told The Washington Post. ""But until we complete a positive identification through the coroner's office we can't say for sure that it is him.""



The toddler's mother, Dainesha Stevens, was charged Wednesday with endangering children and tampering with evidence, the AP reported. She was being held on $75,000 bond.



Beckford was initially reported missing Sunday when his father in Maryland called police and said Stevens left with the toddler and his 6-year-old sister a couple of weeks ago and that he hasn't heard from them, The Post reported.



Mark Collins, the mother's attorney, said she likely arrived in Ohio via bus on Dec. 15 following a domestic dispute back in Maryland, the nature of which was not immediately clear.



In Ohio, the child was subjected to abuse, including severe spanking that caused the skin on his buttocks to bleed, according to police records reviewed by the AP.



On Monday, the day after Beckford's father called police, Columbus investigators were put into contact with Stevens who told them ""some friends took her daughter to another location and she didn't know where it was,"" Weiner told The Post.



Stevens was questioned further and the 6-year-old was later found safe at a house on the city's west side.



Her son, however, was still missing. Police continued questioning the mother and she eventually said ""a male acquaintance left the toddler on the doorstep of a home because they could not care for him any longer,"" Columbus police said.



Stevens later said she had not seen her son since last Friday, The Post reported.



The unnamed acquaintance was questioned on Monday and pointed police towards the city's east side. On Wednesday, a dive team located a toddler's body inside a duffel bag in the creek.



Stevens led police towards the creek, Collins told the AP. No further details were given.



""There's reasons why she said what she said, but she's trying to do the right thing and that's what she did by helping yesterday and today,"" Collins said.

874|Boy in mom's shooting 'unzipped' special purse gun pocket|"SPOKANE, Wash. - Concealed weapons are part of everyday life in Idaho, and that's unlikely to change in the Mountain West state despite a shocking accident in which a 2-year-old boy reached into his mother's purse, got ahold of her gun and shot her in the head inside a Wal-Mart.

Veronica J. Rutledge, 29, was shopping Tuesday morning with her son and three nieces in Hayden, Idaho, when the small-caliber handgun discharged one time, killing her.

Terry Rutledge, Veronica's father-in-law, told The Spokesman-Review that the boy unzipped the special gun compartment in the woman's purse where the weapon was kept while she was looking at clothing.

Terry Rutledge said his daughter-in-law did not put the weapon ""loosely into her purse.""

Victoria Rutledge had a concealed weapons permit, and guns were a big part of Rutledge's life, her father-in-law said.

""She was not the least bit irresponsible,"" Terry Rutledge said in a brief interview with The Associated Press. He complained about people using the incident to attack his daughter-in-law.

Meanwhile, the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office on Wednesday afternoon released a few more details about the incident. The boy removed the 9mm semi-automatic handgun from his mother's purse and shot her once in the head, killing her instantly, the sheriff's office said.

The manager of the store, who was nearby when the shot was fired, stepped in and took the firearm from the child, the sheriff's office said. The manager and other employees secured the scene and evacuated customers.

The woman's purse was new and was designed to carry a concealed firearm, the sheriff's office said. Detectives continue to analyze video from the store, examine the weapon and interview witnesses, the sheriff's office added.

Terry Rutledge told The Washington Post that Veronica Rutledge and her husband practiced at shooting ranges and each had a concealed weapons permit. He said for Christmas this year, her husband gave her the purse with a special zippered pocket for a concealed weapon.

About 7 percent of adults in Idaho had concealed weapons permits at the end of 2012, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. That ranked Idaho among the top third of states.

Kootenai County, which has about 140,000 residents, has issued close to 16,000 concealed weapons permits, Kootenai County sheriff's spokesman Stu Miller said Wednesday.

""It's very commonplace in northern Idaho for folks to have a concealed weapons permit,"" Miller said, and most businesses do not prohibit firearms.

Veronica Rutledge lived in Blackfoot, in southeastern Idaho, and her family had come to the Hayden area to visit relatives for Christmas.

She was an employee of the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho, where she was a nuclear scientist. The laboratory supports the U.S. Department of Energy in nuclear and energy research and national defense.

""We're deeply saddened by this tragedy,"" said Nicole Stricker, a spokeswoman for the lab.

Rutledge graduated from high school in Harrison, a lakeside town in the Idaho Panhandle. She was the valedictorian of her class. She graduated from the University of Idaho with a degree in chemistry.

She had taken the children to Wal-Mart on Tuesday morning to spend their Christmas gift cards, family members said. Her young son, her only child, was in a shopping cart.

Responding deputies found Rutledge dead in the electronics section of the Wal-Mart in Hayden, a rural town of about 12,000 people 40 miles northeast of Spokane.

Colt Rutledge, 32, arrived at the store in Idaho's northern panhandle shortly after the shooting around 10:20 a.m. Tuesday, Miller said. All the children were taken to a relative's house.

Officers viewed surveillance video provided by the store to determine what happened, Miller said.

Like other Western states, gun rights are a big issue in Idaho. State lawmakers passed legislation earlier this year allowing concealed weapons on the state's public college and university campuses. Despite facing opposition from all eight of the state's university college presidents, lawmakers sided with gun-rights advocates who said the law would better uphold the Second Amendment.

Terry Rutledge told the AP that his daughter-in-law ""was a beautiful, young, loving mother.""

""She was taken much too soon,"" he said."

877|Injured Swanson Bark employee leaves hospital earlier than expected|"For weeks, Frank Arce Jr. lay immobile in a cramped Vancouver hospital room, and a week ago his doctors thought he’d be there another month.

But the 23-year-old Kelso man, injured in an industrial accident at Swanson Bark & Wood Products on Jan. 23, left the hospital Saturday and is now recovering at his mother’s home.

He says a combination of a positive attitude, support from family and friends and divine assistance have enabled him to leave the hospital sooner than he or his doctors expected.

“It feels good,” Arce said Monday, relaxing in front of a crackling fire. “It feels like I’m making progress.”

Arce fell through a machine that uses six to seven-inch-long blunt, curved tines to break up clumps of bark dust. He broke seven ribs, a toe, his ankle and his pelvis and he suffered an open fracture to his knee, numerous cuts (some to the bone) and a collapsed lung. He underwent a skin graft and his seventh and final surgery last week. He can now walk short distances and his pain is subsiding.

“(Dcotors) were surprised by how much healing went on in a short period of time,” said his mother, Brenda Shields.

Arce credits quick action by his co-workers to shut down the machine, apply compresses, and keep him calm for saving his life. The same co-workers continue to call and visit Arce and also helped build a wheelchair ramp at Shields’ house.

“You spend more time with the people that you work with than you do at home, so everybody was very concerned (for Arce),” Swanson Human Resources Manager D’Dee Kuanoni said. She said Arce’s progress has uplifted the “tight-knit” company’s employees. “Lots of prayers were said and obviously answered too.”

Arce said the support has been “important.”

“I guess I don’t really have to have somebody there (for support), but it helps,” said Arce, who family members describe as “stubborn” and strong-willed. “It eases me to have somebody there, even just to hold my hand. Knowing somebody’s right there with you it kind of helps me to push through.”

Arce rarely found himself alone in his hospital room. Shields lived in the room with him, sleeping on a “very uncomfortable couch,” and his sister, a nurse from South Carolina, flew in to tend to Arce whenever Shields went to work.

“I wouldn’t have been able to be anywhere else but there,” Shields said. “It sucked. I wish I could have taken all the pain away for him. Really all I could do was be there for him.”

Shields said she’s glad to have her son home so she can prepare home-cooked meals, and Arce’s grandmother helps care for him while Shields works. His nine-year-old sister sleeps on the couch in case he needs help in the middle of the night.

Family members still assist Arce with many day-to-day tasks, such as changing dressings. But in the absence of 24-7 nursing assistance, Arce says he performs many tasks himself. Arce thinks the increased independence will speed his recovery, he said.

“Honestly, I feel like I’ll be able to get most of my movement back,” Arce said. But he has “come to terms” with the prospect of a long recovery. “I can hope for the best but prepare for the worst.”

The Washington Department of Labor & Industries doesn’t expect to conclude their investigation into Arce’s accident for at least another month, spokeswoman Elaine Fischer said Monday. But Swanson has already begun offering refresher safety trainings to employees, Kuanoni said.

Family members have setup accounts at Red Canoe Credit Union and www.gofundme.com/frankarce to collect donations to help pay Arce’s bills while he’s unable to work. So far the accounts have collected about $1,000, Shields said. Arce and Shields said they’re thankful for the donations and other support that has poured in from across the country.

“Family, friends people we don’t even know have been giving their well-wishes,” Shields said."

The Last P.O.W.

By Mike Chinoy (Amazon Digital Services; $.99)

With North Korea back in the news, it’s easy to forget last holiday season when the communist dictatorship detained an 85-year-old retired Palo Alto businessman who had been touring the country. Merrill Newman was on the plane at Pyongyang airport getting ready to head home when officers escorted him off and began interrogations. Though nearly 6,000 Westerners visited North Korea in 2013, Newman was a Korean War veteran who drew attention for his 1953 involvement in a secret U.S. Army unit that trained counterrevolutionaries.

To create momentum, Chinoy cuts back and forth between Newman’s situation and the diplomatic efforts of his family and State Department officials. But Newman’s life is never under serious threat (he gets his medications and is generally taken care of), and though his family is extremely upset, there’s little they can do but wait. The outcome is old news: After 46 days and a staged “confession,” Newman is released. Despite the underwhelming tension, Chinoy’s knowledge of North Korea and his countless small details — the hotel with restaurants known as “Number 1” and “Number 2,” the flowers tourists are expected to lay at the statues of the dictators — make “The Last P.O.W.” a worthwhile glimpse behind the curtain.

Yosemite: A Storied Landscape

Edited by Kerry Tremain (California Historical Society; $9.99)

To mark the 150th anniversary of the Yosemite Grant, which established the first protected wilderness in the United States, the California Historical Society has released a multimedia e-book featuring art, photography and essays on an array of subjects: the military’s role in settling the park, Yosemite’s surprising place in the debate between creationism and evolution, the building of the Ahwahnee hotel, and the histories of mountaineering, zoology, Indian basket weaving, art and photography.

Though all the essays have something to recommend them, a couple stand out. Rebecca Solnit’s piece about the 19th century botanist Asa Gray and his battles with fellow Harvard professor Louis Agassiz over evolutionary theory and the relationship between God and nature is fascinating. With her usual combination of graceful prose and trenchant insight, Solnit places Yosemite on an epic stage. Susan Landauer’s art history essay touches on Albert Bierstadt’s panoramas “filled with religious allegory” and Ansel Adams’ iconic photographs, but reserves her best analysis and highest praise for the watercolors and woodblock prints of Chiura Obata, whose “espousal of the Zen tradition … led him to imbue his landscapes with an intense, often calligraphic expressiveness.” This gorgeous, informative book is like having a museum exhibition at your fingertips.

Five Fires

By Laura Lippman (Byliner; $1.99)

Buildings are going up in flame in the small community of Belleville on the Delaware coast, and Beth Ennis, the 18-year-old narrator of this short novella, is trying to figure out why. First, there was the playhouse a friend’s father built for his kids, then a vacant lot where the high schoolers held bonfires, then a garbage bin behind a seafood restaurant, then the snack bar at the pool, and now a new fire: at the vacant house once owned by Beth’s former friend, Tara Greene.

Are the fires a combination of lightning and drought? Are they arson? Or just coincidence? Why has Tara come back to town? And why has she been following Beth home from work? Lippman, best known for a series of detective novels set in Baltimore, turns her mastery of plot to a quieter setting and circumstance. We read at first for the possibility of a whodunit — Beth? Tara? One of the boys from the community who has been accused of date rape? But it’s the psychological nuance, Lippman’s ability to inhabit the teenage mind in extremis, that keeps us riveted, and makes every twist in the story believable, and ultimately heartbreaking.

The Trials of White Boy Rick

By Evan Hughes (Atavist, $3.99)

Three questions drive Evan Hughes’ gripping investigation into the life of a famous Detroit crack dealer. How did a scrappy 17-year-old white kid named Rick Wersche become a drug lord of such renown that Kid Rock would rap, “I smoke hash from a stick /Got more cash than … White Boy Rick?” How did the law catch up to Wersche, and was he an informant for the FBI, responsible for key information leading to indictments of the city’s major dealers? And why is Wersche still incarcerated 26 years after his sentencing, when all the other dealers he had helped put away, including a hit man responsible for dozens of murders, are no longer in prison?

Hughes immerses us in the underworld of mid-1980s Detroit, showing how the auto industry’s abandonment of the city led to dereliction, rampant crime and opportunities for street entrepreneurs to live like kings. Even before he had a driver’s license, White Boy Rick owned eight cars, one of them “a white jeep with the words THE SNOWMAN emblazoned on the rear.” Though the themes are not especially new — pride goeth before a fall, Detroit as an urban Wild West — Hughes’ curiosity and thorough reporting combine for a gritty and absorbing read.

Today is the last day of 2014 and most of us in the millennium city has plans to party till wee hours. Not only people want to welcome the New Year with joy and enthusiasm but they also want to be safe. In order to lessen crimes in Gurgaon, the Gurgaon Police have come up with a number of rules just for today.

The 'mall mile' would be heavily under traffic restrictions for commuters traveling in and around that area. This stretch of of Mehrauli Gurgaon Road (MG Road) between Bristol Chowk to IFFCO Chowk will be a 'No Drive Zone' from 5pm on 31.12.2014 till 2am on 01.01.2015. Traffic would be diverted at both ends of the No Drive Zone.

In Focus

Special entry stickers would be given to residents of the area. The distribution of these resident entry stickers is being coordinated by Sector 29 Police Station through the respective RWA's.

People coming to celebrate in places on MG road and adjoining areas can park their vehicles in various makeshift parking spaces. Like commuters coming from Gurgaon side can park in the Leisure Valley Ground Parking and people Coming from Delhi side needs to park their vehicles in some parking spaces, which are available near the Metro Station. However, when they fill up the traffic will have to come towards Leisure Valley Ground Parking.

The Gurgaon Police is also providing a 'Park and Ride' service whereby buses would be arranged at Leisure Valley ground to take them to various places. However, it has been observed in the previous years that when the distance is not much and people prefer to walk to the destinations of their choice.

Drinking and driving today would not be tolerated. So people who are thinking of drowning the last year in bottles of whiskey needs to take a cab back home. There would be more than 50 traffic police check points across the city to check traffic violations especially, cases of drunken driving. In cases of serious violation of law, you may be arrested and sent to jail.

Pubs would be under heavy vigilance. Underage drinking or pubs serving underage people would be taken to task by the authorities. In case you are thinking of visiting the malls or Cyber hub, there would be security measures such as checking and frisking of people and vehicles entering into your mall areas.In case of any untoward incident, by someone able to smuggle in any item that can be used as a weapon, bomb or item to cause damage to life and property, the responsibility of negligence on part of the Mall Management/Chief Security Officer will be fixed."
880|Bad Weather Hinders Recovery Of Bodies, Debris|"ADVERTISEMENT

PANGKALAN BUN, Indonesia - Chiara Natasha's entire family was coming to visit for New Year's.

The petite, dark-haired 15-year-old had just moved to Singapore in November to study at a Methodist girls' school on a government scholarship. Her parents and two brothers had promised to join her to celebrate the holiday and help her settle into dormitory life.

But instead of greeting her relatives at the airport, she returned home Sunday to Surabaya, Indonesia, to seek any word about the fate of AirAsia Flight 8501, praying that they had somehow survived.

Families who lost loved ones aboard the jetliner endured another excruciating day of waiting Wednesday as bad weather hindered efforts to recover any more bodies and sent wreckage drifting far from the crash site.

""Help us, God, to move forward, even though we are surrounded by darkness,"" the Rev. Philip Mantofa, whose church lost about 40 members in the disaster, told families gathered in a waiting room at the Surabaya airport.

The search for 162 people who vanished Sunday aboard the Airbus A320 was severely limited by heavy rain, wind and thick clouds over the Java Sea. Seven bodies, including a flight attendant in her red AirAsia uniform, have been recovered, said Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency chief Henry Bambang Soelistyo.

Sonar images identified what appeared to be large parts of the plane, but strong currents were moving the debris.

Choppy conditions prevented divers from entering the water, and helicopters were largely grounded. But 18 ships surveyed the narrowed search area, and four of the seven corpses were recovered Wednesday before the search was called off for the day.

Indonesia's meteorology agency predicted conditions would worsen, with more intense rains, through Friday.

""It seems all the wreckage found has drifted more than 50 kilometres (30 miles) from yesterday's location,"" said Vice Air Marshal Sunarbowo Sandi, search and rescue co-ordinator in Pangkalan Bun on Borneo island, the closest town to the targeted area. ""We are expecting those bodies will end up on beaches.""

It is still unclear what brought the plane down about halfway through the two-hour flight from Surabaya to Singapore. The jet's last communication indicated the pilots were worried about bad weather. They sought permission to climb above threatening clouds but were denied because of heavy air traffic. Four minutes later, the airliner disappeared from the radar without issuing a distress signal.

The cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders, or black boxes, must be recovered before officials can start determining what caused the crash. Items recovered so far include a life jacket, an emergency exit window, children's shoes, a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food.

Simple wooden coffins — numbered 001 and 002 — with purple flowers on top contained the first two bodies, which were sent from Pangkalan Bun to Surabaya for autopsies. The two victims were a woman wearing blue jeans and a boy. The other five bodies — three male and two female — will remain on a warship until the weather clears.

Nearly all the passengers were Indonesian, and many were Christians of Chinese descent. The country is predominantly Muslim, but sizeable pockets of people of other faiths are found throughout the sprawling archipelago. Around 10 per cent of those in Surabaya, the nation's second-largest city, are Christian.

On Wednesday, around 100 relatives gathered for the airport prayer service where Mantofa urged them to hold onto their faith despite their pain. About 40 members of his Mawar Sharon Church died in the crash.

""Some things do not make sense to us, but God is bigger than all this,"" he said. ""Our God is not evil.""

Before breaking up, those gathered stood together and sang with their hands reaching upward. ""I surrender all. I surrender all,"" they repeated. ""I surrender all to God our saviour.""

Many family members had planned to travel to Pangkalan Bun, 160 kilometres (100 miles) from the area where bodies were first spotted, to start identifying their loved ones. However, the manager of the Surabaya airport, Trikora Hardjo, later said the trip was cancelled after authorities suggested their presence could slow down the operation.

Instead, some relatives gave blood for DNA tests and submitted photos of their loved ones along with identifying information such as tattoos or birthmarks that could help make the process easier.

Nearly all the passengers from Indonesia were frequent visitors to Singapore, particularly on holidays.

It was 13-year-old Adrian Fernando's first trip to the city-state on what was supposed to be a fun vacation with his aunt, uncle and cousin before school resumed.

""He is my only son,"" said his emotional mother, Linca Gonimasela, who could not accompany him because she had to work. ""At first, he didn't want to go. But later on, he was persuaded to join them for the New Year's holiday.""

A number of Indonesian cities have opted to cancel or tone down New Year's Eve celebrations. However, a giant street bash was still in the works for the capital, Jakarta.

In Surabaya, hundreds stood in a drizzle holding candles in a park.

""Let us pray for the grieving families of those on board the plane,"" Mayor Tri Rismaharini told the crowd. ""Let us pray this will be the last tragedy for Surabaya.""

881|QF holds teacher recruitment fair|"Educators at Doha International Recruitment Fair discuss opportunities with representatives of Qatar Academy Msheireb, a member of QF, and other institutions.

Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF) has held its first teacher recruitment fair to promote professional opportunities at educational institutions in Qatar and across the region.

The Doha International Recruitment Fair brought together more than 150 potential candidates and over 35 local and international schools to discuss future career opportunities.

Designed to match international educators with fresh roles, the fair was hosted by QF in association with International Schools Services (ISS), one of the world’s leading recruitment organisations for teachers.

In line with QF’s mission to unlock human potential and nurture the next generation of educators to inspire young people with a desire for learning, the Doha International Recruitment Fair supported Qatar National Vision 2030’s commitment to world-class education and the transition to a knowledge economy.

ISS hosts such events in selected cities around the world and this was the first to be held in Qatar. In total, there were 120 registered members of ISS from Qatar and abroad as well as more than 30 walk-in candidates, who had the opportunity to speak with representatives of regional educational establishments.

The array of academic establishments came from across Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Pakistan. Qatar Foundation academies were especially well represented at the fair by Qatar Leadership Academy, Awsaj Academy, the Academic Bridge Programme, Qatar Academy, Qatar Academy Al Wakra, Qatar Academy Al Khor, Qatar Academy Sidra and Qatar Academy Msheireb.

Buthaina al-Nuaimi, associate vice-president of education at QF, observed that education is one of Qatar Foundation’s three strategic pillars and it is dedicated to driving excellence in learning, teaching and leadership through its centres, academic institutes and many other platforms.

“The high level of interest from local educators demonstrates the passion for sharing knowledge with the next generation. We were especially pleased with attendees’ interest in the range of pre-university education institutions in Qatar, which cater to different ages and specialisms aimed at supporting pupils.

“Qatar Foundation is delighted to partner with the internationally-recognised organisation, ISS, for educational outreach and recruitment. Teachers and teaching are central to improving student outcomes and Qatar Foundation remains committed to collaborations that will deliver a modern world-class educational system,” she added.

Bruce McWilliams, vice-president of ISS, talked about the value placed by International Schools Services on the partnership with QF to establish the recruitment fair. “ISS was honoured to work with an organisation as prestigious as QF to present an event that drew many educators seeking positions in quality schools based in the Gulf region,” he said.

“The senior administration of International Schools Services hopes to continue the partnership with Qatar Foundation for years to come in order to further the goal of enhancing and promoting education in Qatar as outlined in the country’s 2030 vision. The result was a fantastic event that will continue to grow in the coming years and play an important role in bringing outstanding educators to the schools of Qatar and the Gulf region.”"

885|After UN setback, Abbas to apply to join ICC Wednesday|"Ramallah: Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas is to apply immediately to join the International Criminal Court, senior officials said today, after the UN Security Council rejected a resolution on ending the Israeli occupation.

Abbas will sign the Rome Statute later today, adhering to the founding treaty of the ICC, where the Palestinians could sue Israeli officials for war crimes in the occupied territories, several top officials said.

The Palestinian leader will also sign 15 other international conventions today, the sources said.

At 2200 IST Abbas is to meet with top officials to discuss the way forward after the abortive overnight vote at the 15-member Security Council.

“The main subject of the leadership meeting will be joining several international organisations, including the International Criminal Court,” chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said.

Based in The Hague, the ICC can prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, committed since July 1, 2002, when the Rome Statute came into force.

According to the ICC’s official website, last updated in May 2013, the Rome Treaty has been ratified by 122 states.

The court can only pursue an individual if crimes were committed on the territory of a state party — one that signed and ratified the Rome Statute — or by a citizen of such a state.

Israel has signed but not ratified the treaty.

Yesterday’s vote defeat came after a three-month campaign by the Palestinians at the United Nations to win support for the resolution that would have set a timeframe for ending the Israeli occupation.

Council heavyweights China, France and Russia were among eight countries voting in favour, while the United States and Australia voted against. Five others abstained, among them Britain, but also Nigeria which had been expected to support the resolution."

Dream vs Reality: Japan crowns the hottest travel destination

Theodore Koumelis - 31 December 2014, 08:47

Japanese destinations (33% of the respondents) and European destinations (30%) are ranked as the first and the second for Hong Kong travellers’ dream destinations in 2015, while the usual hot-picked Korean (6%), Southeast Asian (6%) and Taiwanese destinations (4%) only share less than one-tenth of the votes, respectively.



HONG KONG - As the year approaches to an end, it is the time to set up the New Year’s resolution; have you put together your travel plans for 2015 yet? Hotels.com announces the findings from the latest global survey that the dream holidays for Hong Kong travellers are found to be discrepant from their actual planning, though Japan tops the wish list and the actual travel destinations.



The study, which looks into Christmas holiday habits and cultures across 28 different countries worldwide, explores how travellers plan their upcoming holidays. Japanese destinations (33% of the respondents) and European destinations (30%) are ranked as the first and the second for Hong Kong travellers’ dream destinations in 2015, while the usual hot-picked Korean (6%), Southeast Asian (6%) and Taiwanese destinations (4%) only share less than one-tenth of the votes, respectively.



Dream destinations for Hong Kong outbound travellers in 2015



Destination % Vote Japan 33% Europe 30% America 9% Korea 6% Southeast Asia 6% Australia 6% Taiwan 4%

Rank Destination % Vote 1 Japan 35% 2 Europe 19% 3 Southeast Asia 14% 4 Korea 13% 5 Taiwan 7%

Rank Country % Vote 1 Japan 38% 2 Korea 15% 3 Thailand 13% China 13% 4 Europe 7% 5 Taiwan 4%

The survey also reveals the most popular destinations which Hong Kong outbound travellers actually plan to visit in the coming year. Despite similar ranking as in the wish lists, it can be seen from the rise and fall in the number of votes, remarkably, dream and reality are two different stories. The most-loved Japanese destinations crown the list with 35% of votes, whereas European destinations, which come second, lose nearly half of its votes and has got only 19%. In contrast, the usual hot-picks including Southeast Asian (14%), Korean (13%) and Taiwanese destinations (7%) share 5% more in votes. The results reflect that Hong Kong outbound travellers consider time and expenditure as the most important factors when they plan their holidays.In addition, the study shows the hot destinations where Hong Kong travellers are visiting during the New Year holidays; short getaways to Asian countries will be the trend for 2015. As expected, Hong Kong’s all-time favourite Japan (38%) tops the list, followed by Korea (15%) and Thailand (13%) which comes third together with China (13%)."
887|Iran says nuclear talks set for Jan 15, vows to stand firmIran|"Iran says nuclear talks set for Jan 15, vows to stand firm

Photo Credit:Reuters/Azad Lashkari

DUBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Iran and six world powers are set to resume low-level talks on Iran's nuclear programme in Geneva on Jan 15, with wide gaps remaining in their positions, the Iranian foreign minister said.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, the lead negotiator for Iran with the six powers known as ""P5+1,"" made the remarks in a closed-door session with members of the Iranian parliament's National Security Committee, according to state news agency IRNA.

""We have stood firm and demand lifting of all sanctions at once,"" Zarif said. ""If there are any rational proposals we will comply, otherwise we are ready for any outcome.""

Last week, Zarif urged Western powers to drop ""unrealistic"" demands so the dispute can be resolved. ""I am confident that a comprehensive agreement is within reach,"" he wrote to his counterparts across the West. ""But we will firmly resist any humiliating illegitimate demands.""

The ""P5+1"" - the United States, France, Germany, Russia, China and Britain - reached a preliminary agreement with Iran last year for it to suspend its most sensitive nuclear activity. Western countries in turn eased some economic sanctions imposed during the 12-year nuclear dispute.

Iran says its programme is peaceful; the West fears it may lead to developing nuclear weapons. The two sides failed for a second time last month to meet a self-imposed deadline for ending the standoff. A preliminary accord was extended until June 30.

888|Key developments in police-communities tension - MyNorthwest|"The killings of two unarmed black men by white police officers in Missouri and New York this summer touched off protests and a national debate over police conduct that intensified after grand juries declined to indict the officers.

Tensions escalated further after two New York City police officers were killed last weekend by a man who suggested in online posts that their slayings were in retaliation for the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. The gunman committed suicide.

Some key developments in the aftermath:

___

MAYOR, POLICE UNIONS MEETING

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio met privately Tuesday with the leaders of the New York Police Department's unions, aiming to mend a rift with rank-and-file officers that has threatened to overwhelm his first term.

While administration officials characterized the meeting as the beginning of a process to heal wounds opened by protests about police conduct and the fatal shooting of the two NYPD officers, union leaders struck a more cautious note, saying that ""only time will tell"" if relations would improve.

""Our main concern is the safety of our police officers of every rank on the streets in the city,"" said Patrick Lynch, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents rank-and-file officers.

Lynch has been one of de Blasio's fiercest critics, saying the mayor had ""blood on his hands"" after the brazen daylight ambush of the two officers in their patrol car.

De Blasio's press secretary said the meeting ""focused on building a productive dialogue and identifying ways to move forward together.""

___

MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS KILLED BY FIREARMS IN 2014

The number of law enforcement officers killed by firearms jumped by 56 percent this year and included 15 ambush deaths. But gun-related police deaths remain far below historic highs and lower than the average annual figures in the past decade, according to a report released Tuesday.

The annual report by the nonprofit National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund found that 50 officers were killed by guns this year. That's far higher than the 32 such deaths last year but the same as 2012 figures.

In all, the report found that 126 federal, local, tribal and territorial officers were killed in the line of duty in 2014. The all-time high is 156 in 1973.

___

CHIPOTLE APOLOGIZES

Two Chipotle chief executives apologized to New York police officers who were greeted by a restaurant employee making the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture popular with protesters.

Co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran said in a statement Monday that the employee's action appeared to be spontaneous. They said it happened at one of their Brooklyn restaurants on Dec. 16 when a group of nine police officers entered. They said the officers were not refused service but chose to leave after encountering the gesture while in line.

The executives said appropriate actions had been taken toward the crew member but wouldn't discuss what those actions were.

___

MISSOURI CHIEF: MAN SHOT BY OFFICER HAD GUN

An internal police investigation confirmed an 18-year-old pointed a gun at an officer who shot him to death in a convenience store parking lot in suburban St. Louis last week, officials said Tuesday.

Berkeley Police Chief Frank McCall said several witnesses told police that Antonio Martin pointed the gun at the officer.

The officer was responding to a shoplifting report Dec. 23. McCall said Martin matched the description of the suspect.

Renewed protests followed the shooting, which was the third of a black suspect by a white officer in the region since Brown was killed by a police officer in neighboring Ferguson on Aug. 9.

___

SKEPTICISM IN CLEVELAND

A top official with the Cleveland branch of the NAACP says he has no confidence the city will make changes within its police department without federal oversight.

The U.S. Department of Justice this month issued a blistering report saying a 20-month investigation found a pattern and practice of Cleveland police officers using excessive force and violating people's civil rights.

The city and the department have begun negotiating the terms of a consent decree. A federal judge must approve it, and an independent monitor will oversee it.

Michael Nelson, an attorney and NAACP leader, says he's not sure Cleveland will voluntarily make changes and thinks the final agreement between the city and the Department of Justice should remain in place for years.

___

PENNSYLVANIA POLICE: WE DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO

Police in suburban Philadelphia said a man who threatened to kill officers in an online video tried to run them down in a car and they shot him dead Tuesday. They said he appeared ready to accelerate at officers manning a blockade and wouldn't get out of the car.

Police said the man was wanted for threatening to kill police and FBI agents in the video.

Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said the officers feared for their lives and ""did what they had to do.""

Police said they began following the man after he left a Clifton Heights home. They said he was ordered out of the car but reversed into a police vehicle.

___

LOS ANGELES SHOOTING

Two men opened fire on a police car patrolling a tough part of Los Angeles, but the two officers inside were not injured and one was able to shoot back, authorities said Monday. One suspect was later arrested and the other was on the loose.

Police have not yet determined a motive for Sunday night's shooting in South Los Angeles -- an area plagued by gang violence -- but said there were no indications it was linked to other attacks on police.

___

INDIANA RALLY

More than 200 people showed their support for police officers during a rally Monday in Evansville, Indiana. People in the crowd held signs reading ""Thank You,"" ''United We Stand"" and ""We support you"" while politicians urged citizens to support law enforcement.

City Councilwoman Missy Mosby said she helped organize the rally because she's concerned about the morale of Evansville and Vanderburgh County police officers following protests against police killings of unarmed black men.

The US military released two new videos of airstrikes against the jihadist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL) on Monday.

The strikes targeted four ISIS warehouses near the city of Fallujah in central Iraq, US Military Central Command announced Wednesday in a press release.

“The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to eliminate the terrorist group ISIL and the threat they pose to Iraq, the region and the wider international community,” CENTCOM said.

The US military said the strikes further limit “the terrorist group’s ability to project power and conduct operations.”

890|There And Back Again For U.S. Military In Iraq|"Three years after the U.S. military officially withdrew from Iraq, 2,000 U.S. troops are back. They're restoring the old buildings they'd left behind and renewing contacts with Iraqi officers they knew before.

They're also taking incoming rocket fire at their bases.

This week began an ambitious training program to put 5,000 Iraqi soldiers through boot camp every six weeks.

Operation Inherent Resolve was designed by the U.S. to build a coalition of states to strike back against the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, in Iraq and Syria. The operation has seen a return of U.S. troops to Iraq, mainly as advisers and trainers. Another 1,000 are expected in the coming weeks.

Many of those troops have deployed here before, and have mixed feelings about coming back to a country where America spent years at war and where many believe they had helped create a stable country.

Their commander is Maj. Gen. Dana Pittard, and one recent evening he flew by helicopter to the military base at Taji, just north of Baghdad, to meet about 180 U.S. troops stationed there.

Pittard explained the strategy he worked out with Iraqi leaders against the Islamic State, which he calls by the Arabic nickname Daash.

""Phase 1 is degrade Daash, Phase 2 is dismantle, which will be a counteroffensive, and Phase 3 is defeat,"" he says. ""But it's going to take a couple years to defeat them.""

Trainers will work at five bases and work with Iraqis, mainly recruits just through basic training, every six weeks until there's enough for an offensive.

""If you look around the room at the combat patches here,"" Pittard says, noting the markings on the U.S. troops' uniforms, ""people either served in Iraq or Afghanistan for the most part.""

There are some advantages to that.

""A lot of us served here before,"" says Col. John Reynolds. ""A lot of the Iraqi generals ... the senior leaders know us.""

But for many it's surreal to be back. Staff Sgt. Marlon Daley was deployed in 2003 and 2004, then 2009 to 2010 and again from 2011 to 2012.

Asked whether he thought he'd ever be back here, he says, ""I did not, to be honest.""

Most say they're happy to deploy and help out, they're just sad that the country unraveled. Also, since they had pulled out of these vast bases completely, they're having to dig back in.

On another flight and another day, Pittard visits Al Asad base in the province of Anbar. Here, the Islamic State is much closer.

""Well, you just missed the war a little bit ago,"" says Marine Maj. Patrick Kiley. Turning to a comrade, he asks, ""How many rounds did we take today?""

It's four, it turns out — rocket fire on this contingent of at least 200 troops in the U.S.-led coalition. Parts of the base are dilapidated.

""It is a little spooky to walk out there and just, you know, whatever year we left this place, things are pretty much exactly as people pulled out,"" Kiley says. ""So you walk in and the only difference is there's a lot of dirt on the places now.""

They have been here about a month, and say they don't know how long they'll stay. A wooden building has been refashioned into a dining facility and chapel.

""This building here has old Marine Corps stuff all over the walls that's been painted over,"" says a Marine named Nolan. He doesn't want his last name used in case ISIS might target his family. Inside the building are candy canes, Christmas trees and an improvised kitchen. It's almost cozy.

But indirect fire — rockets or mortars — does come in several times a week. For Cpl. Zak Taylor, it's his first time in Iraq.

""It's not too bad,"" he says. ""You kinda get used to everything. Not the rockets — that's definitely one thing we'll never get used to.""

Reinforcing structures has been a big part of Taylor's first month. Some days he spends 12 hours filling sandbags.

Many of the Americans agree that the struggle against ISIS will take years, and they want to help but they insist they're not here to fight the war.

""We are not going to come in to this country and clear it out again,"" says Maj. Kiley. In reference to Iraq's military, he says they have to start learning to do for themselves.

""We'll give them all of the training that they can handle, but they have to learn to pick it up and plan, prepare, take care of their people and fight the fight,"" he says.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Think of the year 2014 as the year the U.S. military stepped back into the year 2011. That was the last year U.S. troops were in Iraq. This year, they have returned - 2,000 now, another thousand on the way - all assigned to advise Iraq's military in the fight against ISIS. They're settling their old bases. NPR's Alice Fordham reports.

ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: I'm flying over Baghdad in a helicopter, accompanying Major General Dana Pittard, who's commanding America land forces in Iraq now, as he visits bases.

This one's a short hop north to the muddy ground of a base called Taji to visit some of roughly 180 American soldiers who've moved into train Iraqi troops.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Hey.

MAJOR GENERAL DANA PITTARD: How are you doing, sir?

MAN: Good serving with you.

PITTARD: Glad to meet you.

FORDHAM: Pittard points out that many of the Americans have served here before.

PITTARD: If you look around the room, the combat patches here, people either served in Iraq or Afghanistan for the most part.

FORDHAM: There are some advantages to that. This is Colonel John Reynolds.

COLONEL JOHN REYNOLDS: A lot of us served here before. A lot of the Iraqi generals and a lot of the Iraqi brigade commanders - that were brigade commanders, battalion commanders - know us, the senior leaders.

FORDHAM: But for many, it's kind of surreal to be back. America's official military presence ended here three years ago. Most soldiers thought they were gone for good. Meet Staff Sergeant Marlon Daley. He's deployed here a fair bit.

STAFF SERGEANT MARLON DALEY: 2003, 2004, then 2009, 2010 and then 2011, 2012.

FORDHAM: Did you think you would ever be coming back when you flew out that day?

DALEY: I did not. (Laughter) To be honest, I did not.

FORDHAM: Most say they're happy to deploy. They're just sad the country unraveled. Also they pulled out of these vast bases completely, and they're having to dig back in.

The next day, we head out by plane to Al Asad base in the province of Anbar. Here, they're much closer to the front lines with ISIS, as I mention to one of the Marines here.

MAJOR PATRICK KILEY: You just missed the war a little bit ago. How many rounds did we take today?

FORDHAM: It's four, it turns out - indirect fire on this contingent of at least 200 coalition troops, some of them from the Marine Corps. Major Patrick Kiley remembers arriving.

KILEY: It is. It was a little spooky to walk out there just, you know, whatever year we left this place. I mean, things are pretty much exactly as people pulled out. So you walk in, and the only difference is there's a lot of dirt in the places now.

FORDHAM: They've been here about a month. How long will they stay?

KILEY: Honestly, I don't know. It's an open-ended ride.

FORDHAM: So they have to figure out electricity, water, heat. I get a tour of a wooden building put up by the Americans last time around, which has been refashioned into a dining hall and chapel.

NOLAN: This building here has, like, old Marine Corps stuff painted all over the walls that's been painted over.

FORDHAM: This Marine's name is Nolan. He doesn't want his last name used in case the Islamic State targets his family. Inside, there are surprises.

So walking in, there's a Christmas tree, strings of candy canes on the walls.

NOLAN: You'll see, like, there's a rocket hole right here.

FORDHAM: Oh, wow. So you've hung some stockings from the rocket hole, yeah?

NOLAN: Our messmen did.

FORDHAM: That particular hole is old, but rockets do come in several times a week. For Corporal Zak Taylor, it's his first time in Iraq.

CORPORAL ZAK TAYLOR: It's not too bad. You kind of get used to everything - not the rockets. That's definitely one thing we'll never get used to.

FORDHAM: Reinforcing structures has been a big part of his first month.

TAYLOR: Usually dudes, they get off posts, they do six hours of filling sandbags, and that's - you're probably doing around 12 hours a day.

FORDHAM: You're spending 12 hours a day filling sandbags?

TAYLOR: Easily.

FORDHAM: In fact, when they do get hit with rockets or shells, they can call in air strikes. They can watch a live video feed as aircraft bomb the extremists' positions. But despite the infrastructure and the warplanes, the Americans I met insisted on one thing; they're not here to fight the war. They said they're not going into this country to clear it again, and it's the Iraqis who will have to do it for themselves. Alice Fordham, NPR News. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

She claimed that if austerity policies continue beyond the May 7 election then the next generation will face a legacy of debt and deprivation.

She said: “This general election will arguably be the most unpredictable for decades. Figures indicate that there is a strong possibility young people between 18 and 25 years old could determine the outcome.

“Plaid Cymru believes that young people have been forced to pay too high a price for too long under Westminster’s austerity agenda. With 374,000 young people in Wales not in employment, education or training (NEET), urgent action must be taken before our nation becomes home to a lost generation.

“We know what happens when this is allowed after witnessing the deliberate de-industrialisation of many of our communities back in the 1980s. It cannot be allowed to happen again.”

Ms Wood restated her support for a guarantee that any young person in Wales who has been unemployed for more than four months “will be offered either a job, training or an apprenticeship”.

Arguing that young voters will have the chance to exert significant influence at the ballot box, she said: “The under-25s potentially have substantial power in the next election, if they choose to exercise it. I want young people in Wales to back the alternative next May – to bring to an end this Tory-led government and instead to win real gains for Wales on funding and powers.

“If Wales was funded in line with Scotland, we would be able to afford to invest much more in skills including, for example, providing higher education to all for free, as is the case in Scotland. This is money we are owed...

“With our positive agenda to build the Welsh economy, to end austerity and to scrap Trident, there is a home for young people in Plaid Cymru.”

A survey for Demos of 1,000 18 to 25-year-olds this week revealed that 69% were most concerned about “living costs,” while 62% named “affordable housing” and 58% cited either “unemployment” or the “future of the NHS”.

In contrast, only 45% of young people were concerned about “environmental issues,” 43% by “immigration,” 37% by “tax avoidance” and just one in three (34%) about “Britain’s relationship with the EU.”

Liberal Democrat Wales Office minister Jenny Randerson has campaigned for the voting age to be lowered to 16 – a move also supported by Plaid Cymru. The Assembly has been given the power to lower the voting age for a possible referendum on income tax powers.

Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones has argued that in the wake of the Scottish referendum – in which around four fifths of Scottish 16 and 17-year-olds registered to vote – the “mould has been broken and it now needs to be looked at with some urgency”"
892|Motion for Summary Judgment Granted in Non-Subscriber Case Defended by Zach Mayer and Brian Fisher of Kane Russell Coleman & Logan PC|"Zach Mayer This is another good outcome for our client. We have represented them in numerous similar cases and the company has obtained multiple summary judgments and defense verdicts throughout both Texas state and federal courts.

On September 26, 2014, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Wichita Falls Division, entered summary judgment in favor of one of the country's largest food processors, according to court documents. The workplace injury lawsuit was brought by a former employee at the company's facility in Vernon, Texas. The Motion for Summary Judgment was filed by Zach T. Mayer and Brian J. Fisher of Kane Russell Coleman &Logan PC.

According to court documents, the Court determined that the former employee failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether he previously agreed to exchange his right to sue his employer for medical and other benefits that were provided to him following the workplace injury incident.

In the lawsuit filed with the Court, former employee Billy Walkup alleged that the company's negligence was the cause of an on-the-job injury. Following the incident, Mr. Walkup elected to participate in the company's employee benefit plan, through which he received medical and other benefits in exchange for agreeing to resolve all disputes with his employer arising from the incident outside of the court system.

Trial transcripts show that Mr. Walkup argued that he either did not have knowledge of his agreement with his employer or, in the alternative, that he reached the agreement with his employer through duress. The Court noted in the judgment entered that because there was no evidence of artifice or trickery presented by Mr. Walkup, the common-law presumption that Mr. Walkup read and understood the agreement that he signed was applicable.

“Since becoming a nonsubscriber to the Texas Workers Compensation system, our client has modeled its program based upon the strict statutory requirements set forth in the Texas Labor Code,” said Zach Mayer, a Director at KRCL. “Due to the company’s diligence in both developing and presenting the details of the program to its employees, the company has experienced tremendous success in offering exceptional benefits to injured workers.”

“We’re very pleased the court concluded that our client complied with all statutory requirements,” added Brian Fisher, Senior Attorney at the firm. “This is another good outcome for our client. We have represented them in numerous similar cases and the company has obtained multiple summary judgments and defense verdicts throughout both Texas state and federal courts.”

Kane Russell Coleman & Logan PC is a full service law firm with offices in Dallas and Houston. Formed in 1992 with five lawyers, today KRCL has more than 85 attorneys. The Firm provides professional services for clients ranging from Fortune 500 companies to medium-sized public and private companies to entrepreneurs.

893|Alleged coup foiled in The Gambia; president returns|"BANJUL, Gambia, Dec. 31 (UPI) -- Gambia's President Yahya Jammeh returned from a trip abroad early Wednesday amid reports of an attempted coup.

""Rest assured that the Enemies of the People have been defeated,"" the president said in a statement.

The coup was allegedly launched by former state house commander, Lt. Col. Lamin Sanneh, early Tuesday and targeted the presidential palace in Banjul and a military post at the Denton Bridge. The attackers reportedly entered The Gambia through neighboring Senegal.

According to government-controlled local media, ""Two of the attackers killed during the shootout are residents of the United States,"" including Sanneh, who fled The Gambia in 2012 and sought asylum in the U.S. Freedom Newspaper reported that a captain in the U.S. Army Reserves was among four of the attackers who were killed.

The U.S. Department of State issued a statement that it was aware of the reported coup. ""We strongly condemn any attempt to seize power through extra-constitutional means. We regret the loss of life and call on all parties to refrain from further violence.""

US aware of reports of coup attempt in The #Gambia. We strongly condemn any attempt to seize power through extra-constitutional means. — DOS African Affairs (@StateAfrica) December 31, 2014

The Gambian government initially denied there had been a coup attempt. Jammeh, however, later denounced Sanneh, whom he described as a ""disgraced"" former soldier, and the ""attempt to overthrow its legitimate government.""

Jammeh, who seized power in a 1994 coup, has said he plans to rule the country for ""a billion years.""

There was speculation that the alleged coup could be used by Jammeh to tighten his grip over the government and military.

Emergency services were dispatched to the scene and recovered a bag of clothes which had been left on rocks at the shore.

However, a series of searches subsequently carried out failed to locate the owner of the clothes by last night.

At teatime yesterday, the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) said: ""Search And Rescue units have now stood down after a second day of searches for a missing swimmer in the Bangor area.

""Extensive searches have taken place over the last two days, with at this time nothing found.""

The search effort has involved Bangor, Portaferry, Larne and Portmuck Coastguard Rescue Teams, Bangor and Donaghadee RNLI lifeboats, Irish Coast Guard rescue helicopter 116, and Lagan Search And Rescue.

The PSNI helicopter has been used to carry out thermal imaging in an attempt to locate the swimmer.

899|The Sony Hack Fraud by -- Antiwar.com|"The progression of the government’s case indicting North Korea for hacking Sony’s computer system – and revealing the petty ego-trips of Hollywood’s glitterrati – was succinctly summed up by computer security expert Jeffrey Carr in a pithy tweet:

""NK did it 100%

OK, NK did it w/ help

OK, NK outsourced it

OK, NK was told later and bought them drinks

God dammit, NK is guilty of something""

The idea that Kim Jong-un was so enraged by a ""comedy"" that dramatizes his assassination – and, in the process, underscores the juvenility of its creators – was never all that credible to begin with. And the case for pinning the hack on the Hermit Kingdom goes rapidly downhill when one examines the initial communications from the ""Guardians of Peace,"" as the hackers dubbed themselves, which never so much as mentioned ""The Interview"" and instead simply demanded money. It wasn’t until the media and the FBI itself suggested a North Korean connection that the hackers picked up on this diversion and ran with it.

Speaking of diversions: the FBI announced a few days after the hack that they had ""conclusive"" evidence of North Korea’s guilt. The malware, they said, was ""similar"" to the kind that had been used by suspected North Korean hackers in the past and was ""in the Korean language."" This is laughable, since a) the malware was widely disseminated and easily obtainable, b) the ""Korean language"" spoken in the north is significantly different from the southern dialect, and c) anyone who wanted to cover their tracks would be very unlikely to leave these rather transparent ""clues.""

What other ""evidence"" do the feds have? Well, it seems the malicious software unleashed on Sony’s systems tried to contact an IP address (or addresses) ""in North Korea,"" as the War Street Journal reported. Yet as cyber-security expert Jeffrey Carr points out: ""There is a common misconception that North Korea’s ITC is a closed system [and] therefore anything in or out must be evidence of a government run campaign. In fact, the DPRK has contracts with foreign companies to supply and sustain its networks."" Carr goes on to point out that the company that does this for the North Koreans is Loxley Pacific, located in Thailand.

""One of the easiest ways to compromise the Internet backbone of a country is to work for or be a vendor to the company which supplies the backbone. For the DPRK, that’s Loxley, based in Bangkok. The geolocation of the first leak of the Sony data on December 2 at 12:25am was traced to the St. Regis hotel in Bangkok, an approximately 13 minute drive from Loxley offices.

""… If one or more of the hackers involved in this attack gained trusted access to Loxley Pacific’s network as an employee, a vendor, or simply compromised it as an attacker, they would have unfettered access to launch attacks from the DPRK’s network against any target that they wish. Every attack would, of course, point back to the hated Pyongyang government.""

In short, the technical ""evidence"" supporting the narrative woven by those geniuses in Washington is rubbish. Yet they are still sticking by it – because, after all, government officials can never admit they were wrong. Especially since the President of the United States went out on a very thin limb and vowed to retaliate against North Korea – a pledge apparently carried out a few days ago. Two cyber-attacks took down the Hermit Kingdom’s pitiably small Internet structure, which consists of about as many IP addresses as can be found in a single block in Brooklyn.

USA! USA!

There’s just one problem: a rising chorus of independent cyber-security professionals are virtually unanimous in the opinion that the Obama administration muffed it. The North Koreans, they say, didn’t hack Sony – and our ""retaliation"" is looking more and more like unprovoked aggression. As Carr writes:

""Under international law, ‘the fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that State’ (Rule 8, The Tallinn Manual). The White House must responsibly evaluate other options, such as this one, before taking action against another nation state. If it takes such action, and is proved wrong later, which it almost certainly will be, the reputation of the U.S. government and the intelligence agencies which serve it will be harmed.""

Eviscerated is more like it.

So, if it wasn’t the North Koreans, then who are the hackers – and what was their motive? Marc Rogers, principal security researcher at Cloudflare, gave us a clue early on:

""Hard-coded paths and passwords in the malware make it clear that whoever wrote the code had extensive knowledge of Sony’s internal architecture and access to key passwords. While it’s (just) plausible that a North Korean elite cyber unit could have built up this knowledge over time and then used it to make the malware, Occam’s razor suggests the simpler explanation of a pissed-off insider. Combine that with the details of several layoffs that Sony was planning and you don’t have to stretch the imagination too far to consider that a disgruntled Sony employee might be at the heart of it all.""

It looks like Rogers was right on the money. An independent investigation carried out by Norse Security, a respected Silicon Valley company, came up with what they regard as conclusive evidence as to the identity of at least one of the hackers – a ten-year Sony employee with major technical skills who was recently laid off, a woman called ""Lena"" in news accounts. According to Norse Vice President Kurt Stammberger, the group consists of six people residing in Thailand, Canada, Singapore, and the US. How did Norse arrive at this conclusion? As a writer for Slashdot put it: ""

""Rather than starting from the premise that the Sony hack was a state sponsored attack, Norse researchers worked their investigation like any other criminal matter: starting by looking for individuals with the ‘means and motive’ to do the attack.""

The hackers, it seems, outed themselves when they released that massive data dump, which included files from Sony’s human resources department. Last spring Sony fired an awful lot of people – and the Norse team traced their virtual footprints. The culprits had an intimate knowledge of the structure of Sony’s computer system, and this was therefore the logical place to look. Norse uncovered posts on social media where ex-employees vented their anger at being let go, and uncovered Internet Relay Chat forums where these disgruntled types got in touch with known hackers – including one person linked to a server on which the original version of the malware had been constructed in the summer of this year.

The Norse team has met with the FBI and presented their findings, but the feds don’t seem too interested. They are sticking by their totally debunked story, at least so far. Just like the neocons who maintain to this day that Saddam Hussein really did have those ""weapons of mass destruction"" – and that we were right to invade Iraq and murder more than half a million Iraqis in cold blood.

Indeed, the Obama administration’s absurd ""investigation"" seems to have been modeled on the Bush administration’s propaganda campaign in the run up to the Iraq war, in which every possible bit of pseudo-""evidence"" was twisted to conclude that Saddam Hussein was building ""weapons of mass destruction."" Starting with a preordained conclusion, they proceeded to construct a case based on factoids that seemed to confirm it.

Like the neocons who were desperate for a pretext to invade Iraq, the Obamaites have an agenda of their own: targeting North Korea and citing the alleged threat of a ""cybernetic Pearl Harbor"" in order to gin up public support for ""cyber-security"" legislation that would give the government greater power to regulate the Internet as a ""public utility."" They’ve been agitating for this for quite a while and clearly see the Sony hack as their doorway to success.

Can the Obama administration ""stay the course,"" as the Bushies used to say, and ignore the rising tide of skepticism? We’ll see. I somehow don’t think they’ll be backing down and offering that apology demanded by Kim Jong-un.

In any case, the lessons of the Sony hack harken back to basic libertarian principles:

1) Never take the government’s word for anything – they always have an agenda and will make up ""facts"" to fit the occasion.

2) The private sector is invariably more efficient than the public sector – the government’s phony investigation was and is bullshit, while it took independent Internet entrepreneurs to uncover the truth.

3) Government-connected companies are just as bad as the government itself – as Jeffrey Carr puts it:

""Federal agencies’ demand for cyber threat intelligence is voracious and they pay well. That demand is frequently met by companies like Mandiant, now part of FireEye – the company handling Sony’s incident response. The problem is that these companies have no oversight and no standardized vetting of sources.""

I wrote about Mandiant and the great ""cyber-war"" scam here, but there’s another angle not mentioned by Carr: the enormous amount of government money that goes into ""cyber-security"" is incentive for these companies to tell the feds only what they want to hear. The result is an echo chamber effect that blinds both parties to reality.

Which brings us back to the Iraq model and the causes of the “intelligence failure” that enabled the neocons to lie us into war. The simple fact of the matter is that our rulers aren’t interested in the truth because they believe they can create their own reality. As one top Bush administration official told journalist Ron Suskind during the run-up to the war:

""The aide said that guys like me were ‘in what we call the reality-based community,’ which he defined as people who ‘believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.’ … ‘That’s not the way the world really works anymore,’ he continued. ‘We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you’re studying that reality – judiciously, as you will – we’ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that’s how things will sort out. We’re history’s actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.’""

This is precisely what the ""mainstream"" media has been doing all throughout this episode: studying the pronouncements of government officials and relaying this new ""reality"" to the American people with the kind of shameful subservience once only found in totalitarian countries. The result is that even if the government’s narrative is definitively debunked, the average person – who isn’t following this story as closely as the computer experts – will continue to believe Sony was hacked by those evil North Koreans, and that we have to take ""defensive"" measures like bringing down Pyongyang’s Internet and empowering the government to regulate the online world. As George W. Bush once put it: Mission accomplished!

==========================================

In his book, “One Hundred Million Dollars in One Day”, Michael Field narrated an incident that happened at the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting in 1973. According to Field, a member of the OPEC delegation had just been bought a small bottle of whisky by the Middle East correspondent of Financial Times when he looked at the content and asked the journalist: ""Do you know that this small whisky costs the equivalent of four barrels of crude oil?""

The OPEC man went on to argue that the pricing system was unjust, considering that whisky is made from renewable ingredients while oil is a wasting asset. A few weeks later, a combination of events conspired in OPEC’s favour to wrest control of oil prices. With that also, member-countries begun to make billions of dollars from their oil assets and many of them were clever enough to invest for the future while building enduring critical infrastructure. Now that the days of the most recent oil boom seem over, those countries would have to rely on the investment they have wisely made but since our country was unprepared for a time like this, we are now facing an uncertain future.

Whatever the spin being put on the situation by the managers of our economy, with the current global economic dynamics vis-à-vis oil, revenues from our only economic mainstay can only continue to dwindle and it is inevitable that there are difficult days ahead. But the questions remain: of what use have we put the hundreds of billions of dollars earned in the last 40 years from our oil assets? Have we diversified the economy away from rent? Have we improved on our productive capacity as a nation? Have we rebuilt or even maintained critical infrastructure? Have we invested in human capital?

The foregoing are tough questions but it is evident that we have practically wasted our years of plenty. With our oil now being sold in a manner the Yoruba would describe as “gbanjo” in the international market, at ridiculous prices that are far below budget 2014 benchmark (http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigeria-struggles-to-sell-oil-cargoes-offers-discounts-to-asian-buyers/198070/), we need no soothsayer to tell us that we are in serious trouble. The reality today is that in the coming months, at both the federal and the state levels, it will be increasingly difficult to pay the wages of workers even when we know many of them are doing virtually nothing basically because it is our own form of social security. New jobs will also be harder to find for our growing population of young graduates even as the cost of living will continue to skyrocket. Given such state of affairs, our elected representatives at practically all levels may be left with nothing but megawatts of excuses that the problem did not start today and that it is a decay that was gradual and steady. That may well be true but it is not the kind of story you want to tell to a hungry people.

Anybody who can read the times must know that in terms of petrodollars, the best years might be behind us and that things are not going to get better anytime soon. For that reason, hard choices lie ahead for the nation. For instance, can we sustain the subsidy regime that is not only inefficient but has become a byword for waste and corruption in our system as we have seen in recent years? The reality is that we cannot and at some point sooner than later, something would have to give about the issue. The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) has raised a fundamental question about why pump prices have not come down given low prices of crude but since we import the commodity and with the fall in the value of the Naira, it stands to reason that other variables have been introduced into the matter. Yet in the state that our economy is in today, the more desperate clamour for subsidy removal will most likely come from the states with their dwindling share of spoils from the Federation Account.

Also, from the 2015 Appropriation Bill before the National Assembly, the federal government intends to tax Nigerians more this year. Among others, the budget bill proposes to increase VAT from 5 to 10 percent while even “Tokunbo” vehicles may from today be beyond the reach of the poor with the introduction of a 70 percent increase in import duty. I am almost certain that the same heightened tax-drive will compel many of the states to begin “looking inwards” for sources of revenues. Ordinarily, that should be no big deal since that is the way government is run all over the world. The problem, however, remains as to whether Nigerians would be ready for further sacrifices that would entail paying to sustain a patronage system. If the idea of taking more money from people’s pockets is so that government could have enough to service our inefficient and corrupt political bureaucracy, there will be resistance.

The security challenge needs no further elaboration with Boko Haram seizing vast Nigerian territories, hoisting strange flags while killing and maiming thousands of our people after rendering millions of others homeless. But perhaps nothing puts the dire situation as starkly as the fact that today marks 262 days that over 200 female students abducted from Government Secondary School Chibok have been in captivity with no inkling about what may have happened to them.

Ordinarily, these are some of the issues that should dominate discourses in an election season but our politicians are not being tasked on what they would do to redress those situations. And that is because majority of the voters are not likely to make their choices on the basis of such practical issues that impact on their lives and future. Despite the challenges that confront our country today, one would not be wrong to assume that what we are voting for on February 14 is a tribal chief and not president of a challenged country. To compound the problem, the manifesto of those who seek to rule the nation and their supporters now hinge on threats of violence as a form of advocacy, a violence being canvassed to promote or defend primordial interests.

At a time we expect serious campaigns on critical national issues, what we hear everyday are threats about what would happen should either of the two leading presidential candidates lose in a contest in which only one can win. Yet the danger that these promoters of bloodshed cannot see is that it is easier to set in motion such violence than putting an end to it. That is the essence of the timeless 1797 poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe with which I opened the page. It is based on the compelling story of a young magician's apprentice who tries to lighten his workload by experimenting with magic spells over which he had no control.

The tale begins as an old sorcerer departs his workshop, leaving his apprentice with chores to perform. Tired of fetching water, the apprentice enchants a broomstick to do the work for him but as the water begins to flow, he realises that he does not know the magic word to make the broom stop hence the inevitable flood. The poem finishes with the old sorcerer's statement that powerful spirits should only be invoked by the master himself while the enduring lesson remains the admonition that it is almost always catastrophic to set in motion a force over which one has no control.

While many of our politicians and public officials as well as those making threats on their behalf may have taken their families abroad, majority of our people are forced to live in fear that the incitements to make their lives more miserable than it already is may actually be acted upon after the February 14 presidential election. This is not only unacceptable, the authorities must act to ensure that this does not become a self-fulfilling prophesy as my friend, Waziri Adio surmised in his column on Monday.

Rather than engage on how they will improve our material condition as a people, politicians and their supporters swathe the national space with growing calls to violence in the event that the presidential election result does not conform to certain expectations. And both parties are guilty. The challenge, however, is that like the sorcerer’s apprentice, those entrepreneurs of violence have no magic wand to stop such violence once it starts by acts of their omission or commission. That is why they must be stopped now before they unwittingly set our country on fire.

I wish all my readers a prosperous and violence-free year 2015.

Ode to Rita Dominic

I am not a big fan of Nollywood, essentially because most of the stories on which their movies are woven are either not challenging or very predictable. However, I got a pleasant surprise in the course of the Christmas holiday with my family at Ilorin, when I joined my wife to watch a movie titled, “The Meeting”, a 2012 romantic comedy starring Rita Dominic who also co-produced the flick with Mildred Okwo. It is a parody of the Nigerian situation with nepotism, tribalism, in-your-face corruption, debauchery and several other vices that plague public service in our country on full display. As Clara Ikemba, a saucy and all-powerful personal secretary to the “Minister of Land”, Rita Dominic gave a commanding performance that I consider first class by any standard. The movie not only mirrors the decadence of our society in a profound manner but it also exposes the fact that the patronage system that we run in Nigeria today cannot for long endure."

Lieutenant Stu Miller of the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office said on Twitter that a woman in her late 20s was killed in a shooting at the Walmart in Hayden.

""Prelim investigation shows shooting was accidental,"" Miller said in a tweet. Hayden is located in Kootenai County, north of Coeur d'Alene.

Miller did not say on Twitter who fired the gun and could not immediately be reached by phone.

Local KREM-TV reported that the woman had been shopping with four children when one of them, who was believed to be about two years old, reached into her purse and grabbed the gun.

""A very sad incident occurred at our store today in Hayden involving the death of a female customer. We are working with the Kootenai Sheriff's department as they investigate what happened,"" Walmart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said.

Buchanan said the store had been closed and would remain so until further notice.

THE Australian Little Eagle has been a part of the country's landscape for thousands of years, but the introduction of fences and power lines has made the thrill of the hunt more dangerous.

One such eagle chasing a tasty treat in Lockwood South found itself stuck in a property's wire fence, having come too close to the ground.

Three months later, the eagle was able to continue its chase from the very location it was entangled, thanks to the care of the Wildlife Rescue Emergency Service.

The WRES cared for the eagle at its Epsom shelter, mending a soft tissue injury through rehabilitation.

WRES president Neil Morgan said the bird needed a lot of care and monitoring before it was ready to be released.

""They concentrate so much on their prey that they just don't notice powerlines or fences,"" he said.

""We checked that the wings needed mending, but he had suffered soft tissue damage.""

The Australian Little Eagle is less common than the Wedge-tailed Eagle, but is not endangered.

The bird was released on the property of Hans and Heidi Leuschner, who initially called the WRES to rescue the eagle.

It flew into the sky and was instantly ""greeted"" by a flock of other birds, including magpies, surprised by the eagle's sudden arrival.

Autobahn Bendigo manager Dustin Newton visited the property to help Mr Morgan release the eagle.

The business had donated substantial parts and equipment to two Bendigo-based WRES vehicles, helping them to carry out their duties as successfully as possible.

Mr Newton said the parts had helped the wildlife rescuers carry out their duties professionally.

""It pays for itself when you see what they do first hand,"" he said.

""Neil wanted me to release the eagle, but I thought it'd be best to leave it to him."""
907|Energy Column: Ethanol policy reform—the rare place where environmentalists and energy advocates agree|"We all expect to pay a price for missing deadlines — but not the Environmental Protection Agency.

For the past two years, the EPA has failed to meet the deadline under the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires the agency to tell refiners how much ethanol to blend into gasoline.

In November 2013, the EPA did make an attempt to announce the proposed 2014 blend levels — which by then were already months past the legally mandated deadline. The EPA set the proposed 2014 standard to a level lower than 2013's, even though the law requires increasing amounts. Ethanol producers, who were expecting the usual uptick, loudly opposed the reduction. They made so much noise, the EPA agreed to reconsider. To date, the 2014 standards have not yet been announced.

Then, in November 2014, the EPA announced it would make a decision in 2015 on how much ethanol refiners had to add to gasoline this year.

Congress enacted the fuel standard in 2005 and revised it in 2007 — which also provided incentives to America's fledgling ethanol industry. At the time, gasoline demand was rising to an all-time high and oil imports comprised more than 58 percent of U.S. oil consumption.

Then the world changed. The U.S. economy plunged into its worst recession ever, unemployment soared and gasoline demand fell sharply. Meanwhile, advanced drilling technologies began producing oil and natural gas from U.S. shale formations.

With crude oil supplies flooding the market, prices have been cut in half. Although fears over foreign-oil dependence have abated, the United States remains stuck with an ethanol mandate that is outdated, unworkable, and even harmful to vehicles, engines, and the environment.

Additionally, studies indicate ethanol usage increases greenhouse gas emissions. Politico reports: ""Some green groups have vocally abandoned their support for corn ethanol, blaming the crop for polluting water supplies, wiping out conservation land and even increasing carbon emissions."" According to Craig Cox, director of the Ames, Iowa, office of the Environmental Working Group, an environmental group that opposes the mandate as it is now structured: ""Corn ethanol's brand has been seriously dented in the last 18 months. ... it certainly doesn't occupy the same pedestal that it occupied two years ago.""

But then, politics entered the scene. Rumors flew that the announcement of the 2014 blend levels was delayed to help Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, in his Senate bid. Braley was pushing for an increase in the proposed levels and was hoping that he would be able to influence the White House to raise the targets. Politico quotes Braley saying: ""Voters in Iowa look at where I stand on this issue and where my opponent stands, who's supporting me in this campaign and who's supporting (Joni Ernst)."" The Politico story states: ""Iowans say wavering on corn ethanol once would have been certain political suicide in a state where 90 percent of the land is farm acreage. So Braley sought to capitalize on Ernst's expressed qualms about big government, portraying her as someone Iowans can't trust to fight for them."" Yet, Ernst, a Republican, won the Senate seat formerly held by Democrat Tom Harkin by 8.5 percentage points.

Ethanol is a rare topic where environmentalists and energy advocates agree. Now it is time for our elected officials to join the people. As soon as Congress convenes in January, it should get to work to reform or even repeal the Renewable Fuel Standard.

910|American billionaire pledges to purchase Israeli companies to strengthen Jewish state|"Painting a story of harmony, peace and friendship between Indian and Pakistan, as many as 14 designers from both the countries along with showstoppers like Pakistan actress and supermodel Nadia Hussain and Bollywood star Evelyn Sharma unfolded a new chapter of fashion here on the final day of exhibition 'Shaan-e-Pakistan'.



The three-day fashion and cultural extravaganza, which started on Thursday with an aim to bring India and Pakistan closer through fashion, food and music, came to a close with a dose of glitz and glamour on Saturday at the Hotel Grand in Vasant Kunj.



The stage was recreated to give a feel of the Wagah border post with flags of both the countries and a huge gate which transported the guests to the other side of the border as it opened with an audio-visual, which ended with the lines ""Ek shaam dosti ke naam"", mouthed by Huma Nassr, the brainchild behind the event.



Talking about the idea behind the gala, Nassr, a Pakistani designer, told IANS: ""I have been coming (to India) for the last of couple of years for work and I thought why not associate other designers from my country, to get them on board (with Indian designers) and make an aesthetic event.""



The designer went on to add that she would ""like to take Indian designers to Pakistan and do a Shaan-e-Hindustan there"".



The participating designers were Umer Sayeed, Raakesh Agarvwal, Samina Shanjani, Sanam Agha, Asifa and Nabeel, Rinku Sobti, Zainab Chottani, Ali Xeeshan, Poonam Bhagat, Sahar Atif, Jyoti Sachdev Iyer, Ritu Seksariya, Rajneeral Babutta and Huma Nassr.



With hues of gold, salmon pink, red, black, blue, white, orange and green, the style gurus showcased an array of ensembles varying from saris, lehengas, churidaars, shararas, long and short dresses, sherwanis and bandhgalas -- symbolising an amalgamation of style statements from both the nations.



Pakistani designer Sanam Agha, who showcased her latest collection titled Sunset, said her line runs high on versatility and comfort.



""We have used a lot of chiffon for the flowy effect and a lot of browns because its a rage this season. This is my fall collection and the clothes are very versatile,"" Agha told IANS.



Agha also noted that her ensemble is in demand in India and a ""few people have already approached me to stock them at stores here"".



""There are a lot of people who want our styles because they don't get them over here (India) and they want the hand embroidery and they also like the fabrics. There have been some talks (for stocking purposes) as well,"" Agha said.



Indian designer Rinku Sobti, who showcased around 12 black and white checkered outfits with a dash of red, blue, pink and purple, with the high point of a suit-sari, said the range was made by a ""developed"" fabric called silk net, which was weaved in Varanasi.



""We have adopted a village in Varanasi...so we are getting the fabric weaved from there and they are pretty good,"" Sobti said.



Another Indian designer, Jyoti Sachdev Iyer presented her collection ""Audacieux"", made with fabrics like chanderi and georgettes in pastel shades, with actress Evelyn Sharma as her showstopper.



Iyer stressed that Indian designers should also ""be given a chance to exhibit their talent in the neighbouring country just like Pakistani designers ho have come to India to showcase their talent"".



Fashion was not the only talking point of the gala. The tunes and rhythms of songs like ""Aao huzoor tumko"", ""Chalte chalte yun hi koi mil gaya tha"", ""Sone di tavitri"" and ""Cheti bori ve tabiba"" created a mystical aura.



The front row at the event saw faces like Pakistani actor Javed Sheikh and Manzoor Memon, the minister (press) of the Pakistan high commission in India."
911|Korea, Sony hack, Pres. Obama, Free Speech|"North Korea hacked Sony: Not true.

There’s no proof that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea hacked Sony. The DPRK has in fact volunteered to help investigate the hack, and there’s mounting evidence, reported widely in the mainstream U.S. press, that the hack was likely an inside job. That’s right: President Obama and the FBI lied about having conclusive evidence that the DPRK attacked Sony.

True: U.S. government functionaries had input into and are promoting the dissemination of a racist movie, “The Interview,” which depicts the assassination of current DPRK head of state Kim Jong-un.

It is not far fetched at all to conclude that Washington and Wall Street see the movie and the controversy surrounding it as an opportunity to continue its demonization campaign against North Korea—a campaign that is aimed at overthrowing the sovereign government of North Korea.

True: South Korea outlawed a political party, throwing its elected representatives out of parliament on Dec. 19—the very same day President Obama lied to the world about the Sony hack.

The Unified Progressive Party was dissolved under the Republic of Korea’s current leadership. The current president of South Korea is conservative Park Geun-hye. She is the daughter of Park Chung-hee, the country’s former dictator, who had served as an officer in the Japanese occupation army and received military training in the United States. Amnesty International stated that the banning of the UPP raised “serious questions as to the authorities’ commitment to freedom of expression and association.” Amnesty International, not surprisingly, has greatly understated what is part of a grave escalation on democratic rights in South Korea.

The same day U.S. ally South Korea was banning a political party, President Obama gave a year-end press conference. He said: “But let’s talk of the specifics of what we now know. The FBI announced today and we can confirm that North Korea engaged in this attack.”

What we actually now know for sure: President Obama said zero about South Korea’s assault on free speech and human rights the same day he lied to the people of the world about North Korea. In other words, U.S. policy towards Korea isn’t about telling the truth, human rights or free speech.

The truth: South Korea is not just an ally. The U.S. maintains a hostile relationship with the people of South Korea and all of Korea. The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in the Republic of Korea and has authority over the country’s armed forces. U.S. soldiers stationed in the country have special legal privileges not enjoyed by Koreans, and Washington has a history of supporting numerous South Korean fascists and dictators.

To this day, the U.S. has refused to sign a treaty ending the Korean War. The fighting stopped in 1953. That’s right: 1953!

Every year, the United States carries out multiple war games that simulate the invasion and the destruction of the DPRK. Those war games include full-scale mobilizations on Korean soil. They also include the simulated deployment and use of nuclear weapons.

True: The DPRK is no threat to the people of the United States. Looking at the situation from a wider view, it is crystal clear that the U.S. has no interest in freedom and democracy for Korea. All the phony talk about the supposed “lack of democracy” in the DPRK is to distract people from the simple fact that North Korean sovereignty is based on two things: (1) the successful defense of the country from predators in the United States and Japan who would like to control all of Korea and (2) social rights that include the right to a job, equal pay, equality for women (including paid maternity leave), the right to paid vacation and free health care and education (including preschool).

This is one of the toasts I will be making tonight on New Year’s Eve: “May 2015 be the year of lasting peace and justice for Korea and the end of U.S. lies, racism and aggression: Hands Off the DPRK! Hands off Korea!”"

New Delhi: Judges will no longer appoint judges in India. The collegium system of appointing judges, which was in place since 1993, has been scrapped and replaced with a national body.



Sources said that new National Judicial Appointments Commission came into existence on Wednesday, with Indian President Pranab Mukherjee approving a bill passed by the Parliament in August this year.



As many as 16 of the 29 states have so far ratified the bill passed by both Houses of Parliament. Any Constitutional amendment bill requires ratification by at least 50 percent of the state legislatures.



The Commission will recommend the appointment and transfer of judges, keeping in view their ability and merit.



The six-member panel will comprise two senior judges, the Law Minister and two eminent citizens with a fixed tenure of three years, and will be chaired by the Chief Justice of India.



The two citizens will be nominated by a collegium of the CJI, the Prime Minister and the leader of the single largest opposition party. One of the nominated members will have to belong to the Scheduled Castes, Schedules Tribes, backward castes, minorities, or women.



Experts say that the new system will pave the way for the process of selection of judges for the high courts and the Supreme Court by making politicians and citizens a part of the process.



The collegium system, under which a forum of judges used to conduct the selection following a Supreme Court ruling of 1993, has been criticized for its opacity. Before that, the executive used to appoint judges in consultation with the judiciary.

913|Agriculture and fisheries after the tsunami - Indonesia|"Jonatan A. Lassa and Goh Tian, Singapore | Opinion | Tue, December 30 2014, 10:28 AM

Great progress has been achieved in rebuilding the lives of farmers in Aceh 10 years after the catastrophic Indian Ocean tsunami. The hardest hit province is also a fertile learning ground for governments and organizations to develop necessary plans for agricultural restoration after a big disaster.

Numerous NGOs stepped in to help the recovery process and a total of US$7 billion in aid was generated for the affected countries. A decade later, have the farmers regained their livelihoods and has Aceh re-established its position as a rice-surplus province? What lessons can be learnt after the disaster in the agricultural and fisheries sector?

On Dec. 26, 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami swept through coastal regions in Southeast Asia, flattening villages and causing massive loss of life. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported that the tsunami affected significant agricultural land, destroyed irrigation canals, affected 92,000 farms, displaced 60,000 farmers and robbed 330,000 people of their livelihoods in fishing and agriculture in the province.

The tsunami littered the paddy fields with debris and sediments, destroyed irrigation infrastructure and washed the soil of organic matter. Flooding also resulted in an increase in soil salinity.

Because of its proximity to the quake’s epicenter, land levels in Aceh were altered by 1-2 meters.

The change in land structure reduced the effectiveness of irrigation canals and caused some coastal agricultural areas to be permanently inundated. Overnight, Aceh was transformed from a rice-surplus province to a rice-deficit province.

Government sources show that follow-up tsunamis had flooded 30,000 to 50,000 hectares (ha) of irrigated rice fields concentrated in top production areas, namely East Aceh, North Aceh, West Aceh, Greater Aceh, Pidie and Bireuen.

This equaled 120-200 thousands tons of paddy. The total paddy accumulated losses were estimated at 360,000 to 500,000 tons during 2004-2006, nearly the entire annual consumption of rice of the province.

Statistical data suggest that marine and fisheries production fell from about 134,000 tons subsequently to 102,500 tons in 2004 and 81,100 tons in 2005 (or year-on-year subsequent losses of 31 percent and 26 percent in 2004 and 2005).

Salinity was a major roadblock for crop production after the tsunamis. The silting of irrigation channels prevented the use of irrigation for flushing out salt from agricultural lands. Farmers planted seeds in soil with high salinity and used saline groundwater to irrigate their fields due to a lack of knowledge of salinity conditions.

Some studies reported that the first harvest in 2005 was disappointing; only 10 percent of the rice crop in affected regions was harvested. Salinity caused yields to be reduced by 50 percent and in some areas no grain was formed in rice plants.

The loss of organic matter in the soil also reduced yields. Low amounts of minerals such as calcium reduced crop growth. Such nutrient deficiencies can be replenished by mixing manure or compost in the soil.

The presence of heavy metals also made the soil less fertile. Furthermore, the restoration process was largely focused on the construction of houses and roads. Paddy fields were left to the rain to flush the salt out of the soil.

Local manpower was also diverted to construction projects instead of farming. The process to rebuild the livelihoods of farmers was slow and dependency on food aid grew.

Yet overtime, soil conditions improved with rainfall and irrigation. The Asian Development Bank spent $20 million on rebuilding infrastructure for 50,000 ha of paddy fields. By the end of 2007, 70 percent of affected rice fields in West Aceh regained their normal yield.

The introduction of new irrigation infrastructure and training of farmers also helped to increase yields in some areas above the pre-tsunami period.

There have been criticisms against the post-disaster response from both international aid and national governments, including that the lack of coordination among groups or between the NGOs and the government prevented coordination in the rehabilitation of farmlands.

The pooling of resources and technical expertise could have helped in research into salt-tolerant rice varieties, identification of new weeds and pests as well as methods to replenish lost organic matter in soils.

Aid groups could work with the government to roll out plans for the large-scale adoption of tools to monitor salinity levels, the rapid construction of irrigation canals and distribution of seeds.

Other criticism included the fact that the large amount of food and monetary aid after the disaster reduced incentives for farmers to return to their fields quickly. Poor infrastructure and poor harvests further demotivated farmers from returning to their fields.

However, there have been some success stories. The most recent data suggests that in 2010 to 2013, Aceh’s agriculture returned to its normal rate. Since 2011, the total area being harvested and total production improved significantly to the level far above pre-2004.

Part of the progress is particularly due to a higher paddy yield that has increased from around 4.2 ton per ha in the first half of the 2000s to 4.6 tons per ha since 2011. In most of the rice production centers, things are back to normal, with some notable land expansions. Only a few fractions of damaged rice land cannot be fully recovered.

In marine and fisheries there have been positive developments. Households with brackish water ponds in Aceh have also continued to increase from 12,500 households in 2002/2003 to 24,800 in 2013.

The number of households with fresh water ponds almost tripled from almost 5,000 in 2004 to about 14,600 in 2012. The total number of households with fish farms in their paddy has gradually recovered from the 2004 loss and increased during 2007-2009; however it may naturally go back to the pre-tsunami period if local and national governments fail to reinvest in the sector.

However, the complete story of recovery in marine and fisheries is one of inconsistent progress. Cage and floating cage nets that had been significantly developed soon after the tsunamis during 2007-2010, have been reduced by 60 to 70 percent in the last two years.

Furthermore, at least 1,500 fishing ships were either damaged or not functioning — from 9,250 vessels in 2009 to 8,200 in the last two years. Only the number of motorboats increased marginally very recently.

There has been a significant increase in marine culture practices where prior to 2004, there was almost no data on such practices.

In 2010 and 2011, it grew to almost 533. However, this has been associated with the legacy of post-tsunami aid. Recently, marine culture was practiced in only 176 households in Lhokseumawe, Singkil and Simelue island.

The data above suggests the shift to marine culture and larger fishing scales may not be sustainable if the incentives partly created by tsunami aid during 2005-2009 are entirely depleted.

Both national and local governments should find ways to ensure continuity of growth in the sectors.

914|Get all the bang for your buck from gift cards|"Get all the bang for your buck from gift cards

One of the most popular presents for Christmas, gift cards for everything imaginable, are shown at Shop ’n Save in Washington. Order a Print

Norma Tharp McDonald of Houston embraces gift cards.

They are, she says, the perfect gift to give and to receive.

“I love getting them and giving them. I like getting them for restaurants like Panera or Starbucks. If I get a $20 Starbucks gift card, that’s five trips,” said McDonald. “And I believe it’s better to give a gift card so that someone can buy exactly what they like, instead of them getting something they don’t want or can’t return.”

She is not alone.

According to the Better Business Bureau, gift card sales reached about $274 billion this year, and one-third of gift cards were purchased during the holiday season.

Data from the National Retail Federation’s 2014 annual survey showed gift cards were the most requested gift item for eight consecutive years.

However, lots of gift cards expire with cash remaining. More than $2 billion in gift card value goes unused every year, the BBB reported.

“Gift cards are always a popular choice for gift givers during the holiday season. While a gift card does allow the recipient freedom to choose what they want, it can unfortunately also create an opportunity for fraudsters to take advantage of unsuspecting consumers,” said Caitlyn Driscoll, public relations director for the Southwestern Pennsylvania BBB. “In addition, every year billions of dollars are spent on gift cards that never end up being used by the recipient.”

Since 2005, consumers have left about $44 billion unused on expired gift cards, according to financial services data from CEB TowerGroup.

So much unspent cash led to the creation of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act four years ago. It provides some protections to consumers who receive gift cards, such as prohibiting gift cards from expiring for at least five years after they are purchased or after they were last loaded with money.

The BBB encourages people to read the fine print associated with gift cards. Some cards charge fees whenever they are used. Other cards charge an activation fee, and some charge a dormancy or maintenance fee and deduct from the gift card’s balance if not used within a year.

Here are tips from Driscoll and the BBB in order to get the most bang for your buck from gift cards.

• As the recipient, put the gift card in a safe place, or in a wallet or purse immediately to avoid misplacing it. Often, money is lost because people throw the cards away or forget about them.

• Spend the gift card sooner rather than later, especially if it is for a smaller business. Sometimes, a gift card is forgotten about for months or even years, and when it is found again, recipients discover the business is closed or the gift card is now worth less than the original amount.

Using a gift card sooner also helps eliminate the threat of scammers who will write down gift card numbers while they are on display and steal the money by periodically calling the number listed on the back of the card to verify when it was purchased or activated, Driscoll said. Once the card is activated, a thief can make online or over-the-phone purchases without actually needing the card in hand.

• Only buy gift cards secured behind customer service desks and/or have protected scratch-off security codes. Check a gift card before you purchase it – if the security code was already scratched off, that’s a red flag.

• Avoid purchasing gift cards from disreputable third parties or online auction sites that may be selling counterfeit or fraudulent gift cards.

What if you get a gift card to a store or restaurant that you don’t like?

Companies such as CardHub offer websites to allow people exchange or even sell gift cards they received but have no interest in using.

Wal-Mart is offering a promotion allowing customers to exchange unwanted gift cards for a Wal-Mart “e-card.”

The offer includes more than 200 retailers, but don’t expect to get the card’s full value.

For example, Wal-Mart will give you $96.60 for a $100 Target gift card. A $100 Best Buy gift card will get you $92.40. A $100 Gamestop gift card yields $87.15, while $100 in Starbucks gets you $72.45 from Wal-Mart.

For most, though, including Lori Kubincanek of Fredericktown, a gift card does the trick.

“I love gift cards,” said Kubincanek. “This way, I get to go shopping and I get to take my time and select what I want. It is a day out for me.”

Anti-Defamation Commission slams publisher

Read on for article

The B’nai B’rith Anti-Defamation Commission has lashed out at publisher Harper Collins for producing a special edition of its Collins Bartholomew Atlas for sale in the Arabian Gulf…the atlas omits Israel.

The chairman of the ADC Dr Dvir Abramovich told J-Wire: “Deleting Israel from a map of the world is not the way to promote co-existence and peace between Israel and its neighbours. The argument from Collins Bartholomew that including Israel would have been unacceptable to its clients in the Gulf only reinforces and give credence to the inexcusable belief in some countries that

Israel is an illegitimate entity and will embolden those who wish to teach the next generation that Israel does not have a right to exist. We call on Harper Collins to rectify this situation and to ensure that this offensive edition is immediately removed and that in the new edition Israel is rightfully reinstated.”

A spokesperson for HarpersCollins claimed it had been a mistake. But the publisher previously told media that “including Israel would have been unacceptable to their customers in the United Arab Emirates and surrounding region and that they were merely complying with “local preferences”.

In a contrasting statement, the publisher has told media that the atlas omitting Israel had been withdrawn from sale and all existing stock had been pulped.”

917|Reporter’s Notebook: Smelling and seeing the blaze, hit home|"WINDOW ROCK

Waking up the morning of Father’s Day, I remember seeing a haze of smoke rising behind the eastern face of the Chooshgai Mountains.

I was aware of the fire — eventually dubbed the Assayii Lake Fire from federal and tribal fire officials — from our photographer, who alerted two of the summer interns about the fire that he heard on his scanner June 13.

The interns, who saw Navajo Parks and Recreation staff leaving the scene in the Bowl Canyon Recreation Area, the birth of the fire – were the first members of our publication to be on scene.

Strong winds, combined with the lack of the typical monsoon showers in June, helped the inferno grow into a 14,712-acre wild fire, the largest in the tribe’s modern history.

According to the Burned Area Emergency Response Plan, a joint report issued by the BIA and Navajo Nation, the damage of the fire cost in excess of $8 million.

The BAER Plan report also recommended livestock be remove from the forest for five years so regrowth could occur, which will impact locals from the Naschitti, N.M. area that rely on the mountains for grazing, cultural resources and summer living.

From reporting on this fire, I seen how such a disaster — in part driven by the elements of nature and caused by human carelessness of the environment — unified the impacted communities in and around the Choosghai Mountains.

It was emotional, for sure, documenting the plight of the stressed people and animals that were ordered to evacuate as the orange flames crossed over to the eastern rim of the Chooshgais from Asaayi Lake in Crystal, N.M.

By now, I thought that this fire, which had been reported contained that Father’s Day weekend, wasn’t even close to being burnt out by firefighters. Add the reality of people driving down from the mountain toward the community of Naschitti and an emergency shelter being ordered at the chapter house revealed how this fire was nothing short of being a seasonal prescribed burn.

Experiencing these events, I sprinted from my parents’ house in the NHA subdivision to the bus route to get a better idea of what was happening to these evacuees. A slew of headlights climbing down the mountain are what I also remember.

At the road, I was able to stop the second vehicle, a truck with a couple that lived near Green Meadows, known by locals as Biitá’dah with its canopy of pi–on and juniper. Navajo Nation police told them to evacuate the mountain and locate to the chapter or take refuge with relatives in Naschitti, the Halgai zone, or white flats.

The chapter and senior center, filled with emotional volunteers, would be home for evacuees for the next three weeks. Here, and in the communities of Crystal, Sheep Springs, Newcomb and Tohatchi, N.M. These locations would also become the feeding grounds and camps of the various firefighting teams. The fire, which was contained by July 3, demanded the expertise of the Southwest Incident Management Team 3.

At its peak, the Assayii Lake Fire had about 700 personnel battling the blaze from across the U.S., with the Southwest Incident Management Team 3 commanding it.

The blaze, based on my reporting, burnt several structures, including cabins, sheep camps, outhouses, ceremonial grounds and other structures found in a typical Navajo homestead. Some livestock reportedly had their hooves burnt, but for the most part animal instincts kept them safe, including the wildlife.

According to Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, they saw worse fires. This was the analysis they formulated from an aerial flyover they took June 18.

In Shelly’s case, when the fire was growing over 12,000-acres, “It’s not destroying everything. There’s a lot of stuff that is not touched.”

For Martinez, she stated, “I’ve seen worse, much worse.”

Their thoughts about the fire, along with growing frustration with the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management’s red tape of allocating donations to those in need, angered many Navajo people, especially those directly impacted by the fire.

The fire’s impact on the forest and the way in which donations were handled highlighted the inefficiencies of the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management’s emergency response.

At one meeting with the community, many in attendance expressed their thoughts to a Shelly staff assistant of being frustrated by the red tape that Rose Whitehair, executive director for NNDEM, implemented.

“Our president is a heartless, gutless man,” stated an emotional Utahna Denetclaw, who was forced to evacuate the foothills of the Chooshgais.

Denetclaw added that tribal bureaucrats in Window Rock had no idea what the victims of the fire were experiencing.

Some would also claim that Shelly’s statements, along with various other remarks and behavior he exhibited during heated controversies, cost him his election. At least that’s what I hear in the field on my reporting beat.

Nearly three years ago, I had my first experience of reporting on forest fires, the Wallow Fire in the White Mountains in Arizona. There, I wrote a cultural piece of how the human-caused wildfire was also a reminder of mankind being neglectful of being stewards of the land. And from that taste of writing about one of the largest fires in Arizona, I yearned for a fire to report on.

Coincidentally, and little did I know that such wishful thinking would develop in my backyard (I guess it’s true to watch what comes out from one’s mouth?). Still, and in spite of my theory of whether my wishful thinking in part contributed to the blaze being a reality near home, the fact of the matter was that this human-caused fire was happening right above us at approximately 9,000 feet.

Smelling and seeing the blaze, which most people thought would happen other places but here, hit home. I found myself in tears various times, especially after interviewing an emotional community member, telling me what material items, structures, and memories they lost.

I’ll be honest that probably on two different occasions I did dream of the Chooshgais being on fire prior to it burning this past summer. I occasionally find myself thinking of those dreams and why I even dreamt them. Maybe it was because I saw how precious and beautiful it had been from herding sheep at my nali’s sheep camp in Antelope Springs, hauling wood, or cutting timber to build the family Hogan that a massive fire could eventually destroy it and these memories.

After all, many people from Naschitti, Tohatchi and Sheepsprings relied on the mountains for their livelihood.

I thought that maybe I should have had a ceremonial prayer, but may be it was also a warning as well. Or that its just part of nature’s process of cleansing itself.

But, what helped me resolve this thinking, were when medicine healers like Gladys Plummer turned to prayer, singing and chanting — knowledge system of the natural world — in an effort to help firefighters control the blaze.

The hand trembler, whose hands were shaking while conducting her rituals, offered a Fire Protection Way song and prayer for the impacted communities, forest life and wildlife.

After conducting her ritual, the medicine woman offered these words to community members: “Just love one another.”

Her healing ultimately comforted me and everyone else. Coincidently, this is when I would claim that the high-velocity winds began to slow down, which allowed the firefighters to wrest control of the Assayii Lake Fire on June 19.

Since the fire’s demise, most of the community still remains close knit and continues to heal. During the annual tribal fairs, floats by the community were created thanking the various communities and companies for their donations.

What’s more, I’m especially proud how community dinners were hosted in honor of the hundreds of firefighters that contained the blaze.

In a June 26 story, firefighter Drew Henry told the Times how he would always remember how locals impacted by the fire treated him with respect.

“I’ve been fighting fires for 12 years and it’s really cool to help out and be part of it,” Henry said about the largest wildfire in Navajo history.

“I think the Navajo people are extremely courteous and friendly to us,” said Dewey Rebbe, superintendent for the Gila Hotshots. “It was very interesting learning about the Navajo culture. They were just wonderful.”

According to Peter D’Aquanni, fire information officer for the Southwest Incident Management Team 3, “A lot of the fire fighters were in tears” at a community dinner held for the East Pike Crew in Newcomb, N.M.

Even as I write this column, it’s still emotional. All I know though is that healing takes time. Or as Plummer put it, “Just love one another.”

919|Liberia suspends Ebola curfew for New Year's Eve|"Monrovia - Liberia's government has suspended for one night a curfew imposed to curb the spread of Ebola, so that New Year's Eve church services can go ahead, deputy information minister Isaac Jackson said.

The government introduced the curfew in September at the height of an epidemic that has killed more than 3 400 people in Liberia and at least 4 400 more in Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to World Health Organisation figures.

""The president has directed the minister of justice to suspend the curfew for today, Dec 31, to allow religious leaders, churches and other religious groups to allow the watch night services, traditional in Liberian society,"" he said.

The midnight to 06:00 (00:00-06:00 GMT) curfew will be reimposed the following night, when anyone caught outside will be arrested, he said.

Churches that hold services tonight should observe measures to prevent the spread of Ebola such as hand washing, temperature testing and avoiding over-crowding on church benches, he said.

The rate of new cases has slowed in Liberia and health officials say the next phase of the fight against the virus will involve deploying teams of health workers to identify chains of infection."

The historians said they were perturbed to hear voices being raised in certain ""influential quarters"" on the need to rewrite Indian history through an abundant use of ancient mythology and speculative chronology.

NEW DELHI: Voicing strong concern over efforts to rewrite history, eminent historians have asked leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi to refrain from making statements contrary to well established historical facts, asserting that loose or irresponsible comments would tarnish India's reputation.

""Unfortunately even the Prime Minister has suggested that in the hoary past Indians had learnt, and then, forgotten, plastic surgery of a kind going far beyond what is now possible.

""There is widespread belief that soon text books will be revised or rewritten, to inculcate such a strongly misleading and divisive brand of history among pupils in our schools,"" the historians said in a resolution passed at the platinum jubilee session of the prestigious Indian History Congress.

The Congress, established in 1935, is known to be the largest professional and academic body of Indian historians.

In the resolution, the IHC said, ""Throughout its existence it has been committed to the cause of the scientific method in history and its pursuit free of any sectarian or chauvinistic approaches.""

It said IHC was confident that all genuine historians would stand by the values of their profession and resist interested distortions of our past.

""It also calls upon all members of the political establishment to refrain from making statements contrary to well-established historical facts. They should understand that loose or irresponsible statements of this kind tarnish the good repute of this country,"" the resolution said.

In a separate resolution, the IHC said it was disturbed at the ""so-called"" restoration works at the Humayun's Tomb, a World Heritage Site, observing that laid down norms for conservation of monuments and archaeological sites appear to have been violated by private agencies tasked to protect such historical sites."

923|Renewed bombing in Tawila, RSF militia arrive in Kabkabiya, North Darfur - Sudan|"TAWILA / KABKABIYA

The residents of Tawila locality and Kabkabiya town in North Darfur are living in great fear, as large groups of paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) settled in the neighbourhood. The Sudanese Air Force continues bombing the area between Tabit and Shangil Tobaya.

“Government jets started bombing the areas again near the villages of Dady, Khor Mali, Sabi, and Fanaga at 1:15 pm on Tuesday,” a villager reported to Radio Dabanga from Dady.

“The bombs killed more than 40 cows, and ignited a number of fires, but we did not receive reports about fatalities among the villagers,” he said.

The source noted that the ongoing bombardments and the proliferation of troops of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the area are terrifying the people. “Many have fled their villages, and have become newly displaced.”

He urged the UN Security Council and the international community to intervene, stop the bombardments, and protect the people in the region.

On Friday, 19 December, the first contingent of RSF troops in more than 100 armoured vehicles arrived at Wadi Marra, south of Tabit. Their arrival was accompanied by air raids. The following days, more militia troops arrived in the area.

“The arrival of the militia forces has led to a mass displacement of people in the area,” a villager told Radio Dabanga a week ago. The residents of 11 villages fled towards Tabit, Shangil Tobaya, and Zamzam camp near El Fasher.

“Many people in Kabkabiya do not dare to leave their homes anymore to collect firewood and water.”

The residents of Kabkabiya, northeast of Tawila locality, are also living in terror since Sunday evening, when a large group of RSF militia troops in 25 armoured vehicles, loaded with heavy weapons, settled in the area of El Hara, east of the town.

A listener told Radio Dabanga from Kabkabiya that the roaming of the militiamen at the town market, and in the residential areas sparked great fear among the population. “Many do not dare to leave their homes anymore to collect firewood and water.”

On Thursday, a RSF militia contingent in more than 125 Land Cruisers arrived at Kutum town, north of Kabkabiya."
924|Ferry crew 'may have fled ship'|"Ferry crew 'may have fled ship'

Members of the crew of an Italian ferry which caught fire at sea may have fled the ship before passengers, a British showjumper who survived the disaster has claimed.

Nick Channing-Williams was on board the Norman Atlantic, an Italian-flagged vessel chartered by Greek shipping company Anek Lines, when a fire broke out on a car deck, claiming the lives of at least 10 people.

The 37-year-old, who has now returned home in Berkshire, said he and a group of other passengers attempted to connect tow ropes from a tug boat to the ferry when the crew were nowhere to be found.

Smoke billows from the Italian-flagged Norman Atlantic ferry that caught fire in the Adriatic Sea (AP)

He told the Times: ""There were no crew members down there - it was just us. I couldn't work that out. From what I understood, some of the crew members bailed out at the beginning.""

Mr Channing-Williams, who was later reunited with his Greek fiancee Regina Theoffili after they were rescued separately from the blazing vessel, also claimed some crew members had ""got off with the first lifeboats"".

He said: ""There were so many women and children left on the boat. Why were they not the first in line to get on the lifeboat? It was just chaos. And I think there should be a few people with their heads a bit low.

""From what I understood, the ropes on board the ship were not good enough to tow it. They (the crew on the bridge) were screaming at us 'quicker, quicker'. Regina was getting very frustrated with them. She was like 'why don't you go down there?'""

But a spokesman for Anek Lines told the paper: ""It is too early now to deal with responsibilities about the accident. I don't have any evidence that the crew left before the passengers.""

The blaze broke out on the car deck on Sunday while the ferry was travelling from the Greek port of Patras to Ancona in Italy.

The fire caused thick, acrid smoke to fill cabins, waking passengers on the overnight ferry and i n the chaos that followed, passengers reported receiving virtually no instructions from the crew.

The principle of women and children first appeared to go out of the window, and passengers started pushing and shoving and came to blows over seats in the lifeboats and helicopter baskets.

There is also confusion over the numbers of people on board, prompting fears from Italian prosecutors that more bodies may be found once the ship is recovered from the Adriatic Sea.

The names of some survivors were not on the manifest and some passengers listed might not have boarded, officials said. A total of 427 people were rescued, while Anek Lines said there were 475 on board.

In an inspection just days before the disaster, the ship was found to have failings with fire safety and its plans for how to handle passengers in the event of an emergency.

925|PD: Woman tries to attack officer with metal crucifix|"CANBERRA, Australia - The elevation of Wyatt Roy to Junior Minister in the new Turnbull government is widely seen as a reward for Roy's support for last week's leadership challenge.



Regardless of the motivation, the move is a giant plus for the new generations coming through. The widely discussed elevation of three women from the backbench to the ministry was seen as a victory for women (there are now 5 in the ministry), although Turnbull conceded he would like to have seen the representation greater.



Nowhere in the thinking of any of the major parties though is there any regard for the representation of youth. Politicians in Australia, and indeed globally, are rarely elected in their 20s, and most that serve in ministries are well into their 40s, 50s and 60s, and even 70s.



Yet, according to the latest statistics, Australians under 24 account for almost a third (31.3%) of the country's population of just under 24 million.



The vast majority of these until now had no representation, they don't even have a vote.



Wyatt Roy was born in 1990 and has been a Federal Member of the House of Representatives since 2010. At 20 he was the youngest politician to be elected in the history of the Australian parliament. on Monday he became the youngest minister ever.



At last it would seem the younger generations, the future of Australia have representation in the government.



Roy is already having an impact. He recently hosted a forum on youth unemployment in his electorate. he got Scott Morrison along for the day along with regional job service providers and employment agencies at Caboolture. ""Youth employment is such an important issue to me, which is why I invited a senior cabinet minister to conduct a workshop with great local organisations including Beacon Foundation and Noffs Queensland,"" Roy said at the time.



Now with more clout as a junior minister Roy could make more inroads. This week he was sworn in as Assistant Minister for Innovation, a subject he appears to be well schooled in. In July, along with the ALP's Ed Husic, who was also elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, Roy visited Boston at the invitation of Microsoft on an innovation and technology study tour.



The pair looked hard at Boston and how its economy was being battered by international competition and local overseas outsourcing.



""With one in three Bostonians aged between 20 and 34, there was the added concern about future employment prospects for its young. The city didn't take long to conclude it needed to act laterally to refashion its economic focus and priorities,"" the pair wrote in an op-ed for The Australian on their return home.



""Boston embraced innovation, technology and entrepreneurialism as a pathway to future growth. Some key elements were already sitting there: a young populace, the core academic pillars of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and businesses eager to pursue future opportunities.""



""Importantly, for two Australian politicians visiting Boston, representing different political parties what stood out was the fact Republicans and Democrats elbowed aside partisan differences for the long-term betterment of the economy and community,"" Roy and Husick penned



""Through their efforts, Boston and Massachusetts are seeing impressive job growth and revitalisation, with neighbourhoods also benefiting from a more inclusive approach to encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship.""



The unlikely duo looked at what could be learned in what had occurred in Boston, and Massachusetts as a whole, and how those lessons could be adapted to benefit Australia.



In their op-ed article they set out how Australia could innovate.



""Although conventional thinking would dictate otherwise, we believe it is our obligation to the next generation of Australians to move away from kneejerk political partisanship towards a longer view that embraces opportunities for collaborative policymaking,"" they wrote.



""It can and must start now, to ensure we extend a remarkable quarter-century of uninterrupted economic growth by nurturing a start-up ecosystem that allows new enterprises to emerge and drive new opportunity.""



""As a nation, our potential is limitless. Australia boasts an abundance of young, smart individuals and a lifestyle the envy of the world. We have an ever-deepening relationship with our neighbours in the powerhouse Asian economies around which the future of regional economic prosperity will be shaped, Roy and Husic wrote.



""As two innovation advocates from opposite sides of the parliament, we recognise this will require national leadership: across parliament, business, in science and higher education communities, and the media.""



""We agree new policies are required to change our culture, some of which we've started to see emerge. At their philosophical heart, these should acknowledge that risk and failure are not attributes to be mitigated against but essential to developing entrepreneurial spirit and culture,"" said Roy and Husic.



""We need new approaches to help attract significant capital to enable Australian start-up businesses turn far-fetched ideas into economic and commercial reality.""



""We need to enhance our own skills base so the next generation of Australians has every opportunity to fully participate in and benefit from the changing economy,"" wrote the visitors.



""And we should actively reach out to the best and brightest from across the globe, ""on-shoring"" entrepreneurial talent to team with local talent in developing and promoting our next big ideas.""



""Finally, we must generate greater co-operation between research, business and government on commercialisation, with the measure of success moving beyond just research for research's sake to the high-water mark of transforming ideas into reality,"" Roy and Husic enthused



""If we can get this right, the next generation of Australians can be assured of a sustained trajectory of rising job opportunities and living standards.""



""Above all, we agree that as policymakers we must not let fear define our response to the new age of technology disruption via hasty and heavy-handed reactive regulation,"" said the pair.



""We must be prepared to collaborate, experiment, innovate and, more important, act.""



Roy now has been given the tools to project the ideas he and Husic have put together and with Husic's support they may yet win bipartisan support in their quest to innovate Australia.



Roy has been long involved in the tech sector and has forged relationships with a number of industry leaders locally and has visited successful companies in Silicon Valley, New York and Israel as well as Boston. He's also made it known he wants to stop the movement overseas of some of Australia's tech whiz kids, and maybe even get back some of the 25,000-odd Australians working in Silicon Valley.



He will no doubt too want to tap the magnetism of Ireland, in particular Dublin which has been dubbed the Silicon Valley of Europe. Major international tech firms such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo and others have set up their global headquarters in Dublin or other parts of Ireland. While their prime motivation in moving to Ireland was driven by major tax concessions the irish government introduced to promote its economy, the mere environment that has been created is now of significanct importance. The pool of talent locally in the small nation (population 4.6 million) is huge and much of the youth in the country is now focusing their education towards the technology ecosystem.



Roy will find it hard to compete, a) because Australia is coming from behind, way behind, and b) because of Ireland's 2.5% tax rate for tech companies. While some feel Ireland has given away its soul for a lower tax rate they forget the 2.5% is on the entire worldwide profits of these huge tech conglomerates, which rank among the largest corporations in the world. And after all, 2.5% of tens of billions of dollars each year, as opposed to 100% of nothing is the reason Ireland is being so generous. (Big News Network)."
926|Prosecutors question burning ferry captain, crew - update|"Prosecutors question burning ferry captain, crew - update

Probe continues into cause of fire that killed at least 11



(ANSA) - Bari, December 31 - Prosecutors on Wednesday continued to probe the fiery ferry disaster that killed at least 11 and left potentially dozens of others still not accounted for. Some 427 people were rescued from the Norman Atlantic car ferry that caught fire Sunday and, as the naval ship San Giorgio brought 212 of those into port in Brindisi, prosecutors questioned the captain and crew. The interrogation of ferry captain Argilio Giacomazzi and his crew lasted more than five hours as rescued passengers landing in snow-covered Brindisi were lodged in local hotels late Tuesday. Prosecutors said they feared dozens of stowaways and other passengers not formally registered on the ferry, which left Greece heading for Italy when fire broke out, might be lost or still trapped in the stricken ferry. But exact numbers are not year clear. Alarms were being raised Tuesday over a number of people believed to be on the car ferry and still not accounted for. Among those was a Georgian Orthodox cleric said to be on the Norman Atlantic and who has not been heard from since the disaster, Georgian media reported Tuesday. The dead were three Neapolitan truck drivers, tentatively identified as Carmine Balsano, Giovanni Rinaldi, and Michele Riccardo.

Meanwhile, prosecutors have said they were seizing private phones from the Norman Atlantic as part of their probe into the disaster and were including the owner of the multi-deck car ferry in their investigation.

They also were authorized to have the wreck of the ferry towed to Brindisi as part of the investigation. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said during a visit to Albania on Tuesday that the judiciary must determine the causes of the disaster."
927|Punjab, Kerala strongly oppose new Civil Aviation Policy over international hubs|"New Delhi: Punjab, Kerala and some other states on Tuesday strongly opposed the government's draft Civil Aviation Policy that talks of creating only six international hubs in the country.

Opposing the Civil Aviation Ministry's proposal to limit international hubs to only six metros, Punjab Revenue Minister Bikram Singh Majithia said such a policy would work against the interests of different states.

""If implemented the policy will work against the interests of people of various regions as they will have to travel to other international hubs for onward journeys,"" he said.

Majithia urged Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju to allow airlines to choose different international airports from across the country as their hub instead of limiting the choice to six metro airports to ensure balanced regional economic development and called for making Amritsar as one of the hubs in Punjab.

He said keeping in view the religious importance and huge flow of pilgrims and tourists to Sri Harmandir Sahib, Sri Guru Ramdas International Airport at Amritsar be made international hub with a special focus on creating a cargo hub as it is the old silk route to explore the Middle East trade potential.

Punjab also urged the Centre to start international flights from Chandigarh soon.

Kerala government officials expressed hope that the draft policy is not implemented. Opposing the proposal, they said the international arrival and departure from three airports in the state -- Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode --are higher than the Chennai airport.

Representing Punjab at a meeting held here to discuss the draft civil aviation policy, Majithia made a forceful argument against the proposal while pointing out that due to the ""discriminatory attitude"" of the previous Congress-led UPA government, Punjab has suffered a lot on Civil Aviation front as Amritsar-London-Birmingham-Toronto flight was discontinued and NRI Punjabis have to now first travel to Delhi to take flight.

He said that Amritsar was one of the most visited first seven places throughout the world as people from every nook and corner of the world want to pay their obeisance at this sanctum sanctorum but due to non-availability of direct flights they were unable to visit it.

He also underlined the need of developing Amritsar and Chandigarh international airports as international hubs due to more than 25 per cent passengers belonging to Punjab taking flights or landing in New Delhi.

He said that the Chandigarh Airport has touched the figure of 10 lakh passengers per year and growing at the rate of 20 per cent annually.

Making out a case for starting direct international flights from the Chandigarh airport by making it 24-hour operational from the present eight-hour duration, the Punjab minister said if this was done, people would be saved from travelling to Delhi for their onward journey.

He also asked the Union Civil Aviation Ministry to take up the matter of renaming the new Chandigarh International Terminal as ""Shaheed-E-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh International Airport, Mohali"".

He also asked for setting up of a MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) facility at the Chandigarh international airport to create a north Indian hub for the maintenance of aircraft.

929|French president vows to fight anti-Semitism, racism in 2015|"PARIS — French President Francois Hollande has used his New Year’s Eve television speech to say that the fight against racism and anti-Semitism will be his national cause for 2015.

Pointing out “the rising, worrying threats” of terrorism and fundamentalism, Hollande urged the French not to succumb to fear. He didn’t say how he would achieve his 2015 goal, but in an apparent reference to the far-right National Front, Hollande said France must remain in the eurozone.

French Jews have been targets of a spate of anti-Semitic attacks over the past year, the latest of which involved the brutal rape of a Jewish woman during a robbery of the Jewish couple in the Paris suburb of Creteil.

In December, French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said anti-Semitic acts and threats have more than doubled in the past 10 months and called for the authorities to ensure that “none of them goes unpunished.”

Speaking at a rally in Creteil, where the attack took place, Cazeneuve said: “We need to make the fight against racism and anti-Semitism a national cause by getting all bodies concerned involved.”

“The Republic will defend you with all its force because, without you, it would no longer be the Republic,” he added.

France has also seen an increase in acts of racism in 2014, according to government statistics. Examples included Muslim Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem and black Justice Minister Christiane Taubira both being the target of slurs.

France is home to some 500,000-600,000 Jews, the third largest Jewish population in the world, after Israel and the United States.

Tensions over the recent Gaza conflict spilled out into the streets in July with looters destroying Jewish businesses and shouting anti-Israeli slogans.

The number of French Jews who have moved to Israel in the first 10 months of 2014 has more than doubled compared to last year, the Jewish Agency has said, attributing the spike to a sluggish economy and a rise in anti-Semitic sentiment.

The number of French Jews who have moved to Israel in the first 10 months of 2014 has more than doubled compared to last year, according to the Jewish Agency, attributing the spike to a sluggish economy and a rise in anti-Semitic sentiment.

On Wednesday, the Jewish Agency said that immigration to Israel hit a ten-year high in 2014, with France at the top of the list of countries from which immigrants moved this year, with over a quarter — about 7,000 people — making the leap. It was the largest single-year movement of French Jews to Israel since the founding of the state.

Japan Herald (ANI) Wednesday 31st December, 2014

According to new reports, Sony employees had to resort to older technologies like the Blackberry to keep the work going and used a phone tree to relay messages when the cyberattack on Sony Pictures was launched.

The employees relayed details about the hack from one person to another via phones and had to use ancient technology to issue physical checks since they couldn't transfer salaries through bank deposit.

Sony CEO Michael Lynton said that it took him more than 24 hours to realize the severity of the attack, reported CNN.

The company's entire computer system had been down during the week of Thanksgiving.

Employees also had to cut paychecks manually, use personal cellphones, Gmail accounts and notepads. (ANI)"
932|Letter: Extreme labels|"America is great because of difference of opinions. I hope that we can be civil in our opinions and act accordingly.

I have been reading the comments from Jon Huntsman Sr. about Sen. Mike Lee. It is interesting that when someone has a different opinion we begin to label that person as an ""embarrassment"" or an ""extremist.""

People generally use labels for one of several reasons: 1) the labeler is a puppet following other opinions; 2) the labeler fears the other person is right; 3) someone wants control; 4) someone strongly believes a political view and wants to discredit the other viewpoint.

This feeling was evident with the minutemen and others who wanted to be free from England. Most of those in Boston wanted to stay united with England. The minutemen were looked down on as an embarrassment or as extremists.

It would be nice if we could tolerate others and their viewpoints. It would be nice to listen, to see other views and stay friends while hopefully working together. America is great because of difference of opinions. I hope that we can be civil in our opinions and act accordingly.

933|Islamic State ask on Twitter how to kill captured Jordanian pilot|"Islamic State ask on Twitter how to kill captured Jordanian pilot

Utah Independent Wednesday 31st December, 2014

• The pilot, Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh, 26, a first lieutenant in Jordan's air force, was captured after his F-16 jet crash-landed near the Syrian city of Raqqa

• According to Vocative, some of the ideas shared by ISIS followers to kill Moaz include beheading him, burning him alive and running him over with a bulldozer.

• But people have also taken to Twitter to post on a hashtag that translates as ""We are all Moaz"", praising the pilot and offering messages of support for his family.

DAMASCUS/LONDON - Islamic State militants in Syria have invited suggestions on Twitter on the best way to kill a Jordanian pilot captured last week with their gruesome Arabic hashtag ""Suggest a Way to Kill the Jordanian Pilot Pig"" being retweeted over a thousand times.

The pilot, Mu'ath Safi Yousef al-Kaseasbeh, 26, a first lieutenant in Jordan's air force, was captured after his F-16 jet crash-landed near the Syrian city of Raqqa, which is held by ISIS (also known as ISIL).

Jordan has threatened the IS with ""grave consequences"" if the pilot is harmed, while the Islamists have demanded that Jordan quit the US-led coalition and release several prisoners in exchange for his release.

Several ISIS-affiliated Twitter accounts have asked the organization's followers to suggest ways of killing Kaseasbeh.

Kasaesbeh, also known as Moaz, was captured by IS fighters on Christmas Eve.

The IS published an interview with the pilot in Dabiq, its monthly English-language magazine, last week. The piece ends with the question ""Do you know what the Islamic State will do with you?"" To which Al-Kasasbeh replies: ""Yes They will kill me"".

According to Vocative, some of the ideas shared by ISIS followers to kill Moaz include beheading him, burning him alive and running him over with a bulldozer.

Many of the Twitter posts contained graphic embedded images, including photographs of beheadings and of wounded children. One showed a steamroller captioned with a message that translates into ""Goodbye Moaz"", while another featured a stock picture saying ""Nothing better than the axe"".

Another hashtag that translates as ""We all want to slaughter Moaz"" has been tweeted thousands of times too. That hashtag featured doctored images of the pilot with IS soldiers, including one of the man being held by ""Jihadi John"", the IS member that the group claims was behind the killing of many of the British and US men shown in videos released this year.

But people have also taken to Twitter to post on a hashtag that translates as ""We are all Moaz"", praising the pilot and offering messages of support for his family.

One participant, claiming to be the mother of a Syrian man killed by a coalition air strike, suggested that Kaseasbeh should be ""impaled and hung on a pole so that he dies slowly. And it would be mercy to kill him by gun or a knife"".

Moaz's plane was the first US-led coalition aircraft to be lost on IS territory since air strikes began in September.

The jihadist group claimed it had shot down the jet with a heat-seeking missile near the city of Raqqa.

But the Jordanian government and U.S. Central Command described the incident as an aircraft crash and adamantly stated that it was not shot down by ISIS.

""I checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning,"" the pilot is quoted as saying. ""The plane began to deviate from its normal flight path, so I ejected. I landed in the Furat River by parachute and the seat caught on some ground, keeping me fixed, until I was captured by soldiers of the Islamic State."""

Aiming to better address mental health issues and to treat those who suffer, often in silence, Memorial Hermann has now opened a second Mental Health Crisis Clinic. The new facility is located in the Spring Branch area at 10780 Westview Drive, Suite C.

The walk-in clinic, which will offer nontraditional access to a multidisciplinary team, will staff a psychiatrist, nurse practitioner and social worker in addition to other personnel dedicated to patient care. The clinic will be a means of quick access to care for those who need it, offering initial psychiatric evaluation and treatment along with outpatient services.

“Recognizing the scarcity of mental health resources in Houston/Harris County region, we worked quickly to get this clinic up and running,” said Theresa Fawvor, senior director Behavioral Health Services for Memorial Hermann. “The volume of traffic at our first clinic in Humble starkly illustrates the need for these services. Because of its location, we expect even greater traffic for the Spring Branch clinic. Our goal is to be a resource that will direct people to the appropriate level of care and setting — one that is conducive to helping patients get better.”

The Mental Health Crisis Center will keep hours from Sunday through Thursday, 4 p.m. to 12 a.m."

Hybrid plane enters record books as first in the world to be successfully tested - picture by the University of...

The world's first hybrid plane that can recharge itself mid flight has been successfully tested at Sywell Aerodrome in Northamptonshire.

The aircraft has been created by a team at Cambridge University, working with Boeing, who carried out the maiden flight at the airfield on December 23.

They hope that the plane will be able to provide new forms of cleaner, low-carbon air travel.

Hybrid engines - which are gaining popularity in cars - combine a battery and a petrol engine. Doing so uses 30 per cent less fuel than a plane with a petrol-only engine.

The petrol engine works with the battery-powered one at take-off and climb (when the plane needs extra power), but the electric motor can then switch into generator mode and recharges the batteries, or help the motor in minimising fuel consumption. The same technology is used in hybrid cars.

""Although hybrid cars have been available for more than a decade, what's been holding back the development of hybrid or fully-electric aircraft until now is battery technology,' said Dr Paul Robertson of Cambridge's Department of Engineering, who led the project.

""Until recently, they have been too heavy and didn't have enough energy capacity. But with the advent of improved lithium-polymer batteries, similar to what you'd find in a laptop computer, hybrid aircraft – albeit at a small scale – are now starting to become viable.""

Based on a commercially available single seater, the aircraft is also able to recharge its batteries in flight.

During the tests the plane performed a series of 'hops' along the runway, before a flight at over 1,500 feet.

But passengers won't be able to board a hybrid plane any time soon, as a jetline would only be able to stay airborne for a matter of minutes.

Dr Robertson said that while the successful flight is an important step in the development of hybrid or fully-electric aircraft, more research is required before commercial airliners will be powered entirely with electric motors.

Currently if all the engines and all the fuel in a modern aircraft were replaced by batteries, it would have a total flying time of roughly ten minutes."
938|BJP cries UPA conspiracy as CBI court drops charges against Amit Shah|"New Delhi: BJP today welcomed the court ruling discharging its president Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter killing case, saying the CBI had acted against him under pressure from the previous UPA regime.

Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said justice finally prevailed as CBI had sought to implicate Shah based on hearsay and legally unsustainable evidence.

""It is a matter of great assurance that the hon'ble court has found the entire CBI case against BJP President Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin murder case as politically motivated.""

""In fact the manner in which under political pressure of the previous regime, the CBI sought to implicate Amit Shah upon hearsay and legally unsustainable evidences spoke volumes of vendetta politics,"" Prasad said.

He said a prosecution based on ""collusive evidences"" not legally admissible was bound to be rejected in a ""fair proceeding"".

""We warmly applaud this judgment,"" he said.

A special CBI court in Mumbai discharged Shah in the case of Sohrabuddin fake encounter killing in 2005. The CBI had charged Shah, the then Minister of State for Home in Gujarat, as an accused in the killing of gangster Sohrabuddin and Tulsiram Prajapati, who was said to have been an eyewitness to the encounter.

MP Meenakshi Lekhi also welcomed the verdict and said it vindicated BJP's stand.

""It vindicates our stand that motivated and especially politically-motivated campaign based on vendetta cannot run the courts and courts will do justice and courts have done justice,"" she said.

941|Dela addresses her first meeting with KKD -|"As the saying goes, the downfall of an elephant attracts any animal to step on it.

Thats the same thing happening to Fashion icon, Kwasi Kyei Darkwa, known in Showbiz circle as KKD.

We can all recall some days ago it was reported that KKD has been arrested for allegedly raping a 19-year-old girl, a case which has landed him in police cells.

Well, in less than a week and over 10 unknown women have come out to accuse KKD of rape.

Well, according to one lady who goes by the name Dela Goldheart, she wouldnt be surprised if KKD raped the 19-year-old girl because to her, KKD has this thing for tall ladies.

She shared her first experience with KKD.

This is what Dela posted on her Facebook timeline…

IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME

Few years ago, whiles attending a beauty contest with my cousine at the National Theatre, I met the man called KKD. We had arrived and taken our seats when someone requested my audience. My cousine inquired from the messenger and was told KKD wanted to see me so she allowed me to go to him. I followed the messenger and met for the first time the man who I had heard so much about and seen a little on TV. But regarding the fact that I have always been that girl who is hardly moved by names, status and wealth, I maintained my cool.

The first thing he asked me upon reaching where he stood with some friends was ‘How tall are you?’. It must be a frequent question he asks young tall girls like myself. I replied him I didn’t know my height. Then he said ‘You are beautiful, I would like to sponsor your modeling career’. I smiled and told him I was still in school and that I would like to wait until after SSS. He insisted and said I should go to Exopa Modelling Agency, ask for Mr. Ibrahim Sima and inform him he KKD sent me.

Well, to a young girl who has so often been referenced with her height, connected to modelling and pagentry, this was a golden opportunity. But I still wanted to achieve my academic dreams too so I waited with plans of accepting his offer after SSS and joining the biggest modeling agency in Ghana by then. Well, the bad or good news is that I never got to join since its CEO was arrested just few weeks after I had met KKD.

The 19yr old girl who claimed to have been raped by KKD, according to the prosecution, said KKD admired her height whiles she attended a fashion show with her cousine that night and asked her to assist him with his make-up, then pounced on her. I AM NOT SURPRISED. ARE YOU?

943|Indonesian frog is one of a kind|"By Will Dunham

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Its fangs are not what makes the newly identified Indonesian frog species Limnonectes larvaepartus unique on Earth. The way it makes babies does.

This little amphibian from the rain forests of Indonesia's island of Sulawesi is the only one of the world's 6,455 frog species to give direct birth to tadpoles, eschewing the common froggy practice of laying eggs, scientists said on Wednesday.

""Reproduction in most frogs could not be more different from human reproduction. In this case, what is most interesting, ironically, is that the reproductive mode is more similar to our own,"" said herpetologist Jimmy McGuire of the University of California, Berkeley, whose research appears in the scientific journal PLOS ONE.

This frog, usually gray or brown, measures about 1-1/2 inches long (40 mm), weighs less than two-tenths of an ounce (5 grams) and belongs to the Asian group of fanged frogs. Males possess two fang-like projections from the lower jaw that are used in fighting.

The frog lives along small streams and puddles in rainforest habitats, doing its best to avoid being eaten by larger fanged frog species as well as snakes and frog-munching birds.

Its mode of reproduction sets this frog apart.

""The vast, vast majority of frogs have external fertilization. For mating, the male grips the female around the waist and releases sperm as she releases her eggs,"" McGuire said.

Those eggs mature through stages including the aquatic tadpole larval phase, typically limbless with a tail that propels it through the water.

About a dozen frog species rely on internal fertilization, McGuire said. All but the newly identified one either deposit fertilized eggs or give birth to froglets, essentially miniature versions of an adult that already passed through a modified tadpole stage while still in an egg capsule inside the female.

The female Limnonectes larvaepartus (meaning ""marsh swimmer that gives birth to larvae"") instead gives birth to tadpoles.

""It's totally unclear why this mode of reproduction has not evolved more frequently,"" McGuire said.

""My favorite topic when it comes to frog evolution and diversification is the bewildering variation in reproductive modes that occur. Frogs exhibit all sorts of interesting twists.""

There have been frogs that swallowed their eggs and brooded them in the stomach, a species in which the male broods the eggs in his vocal sac, and many species that carry eggs and tadpoles in pouches on their backs and sides, he said.

946|‘Ransomware’ scam leaves victims powerless|"× ‘Ransomware’ scam leaves victims powerless

Manchester, Tenn. — Police said hackers have found a way to take over smart phones and extorts owners using pornographic images.

This new scam leaves victims virtually powerless. The message reportedly appears on smart phones out of nowhere and looks very serious.

“It quotes even United States criminal code statutes of what’s been violated,” said Frank Watkins, an investigator with the Coffee County Sheriff’s Office.

What the message says next is even scarier.

“This phone has been found to have accessed explicit or pornographic images and we can take care of this for $500,” Watkins said.

The so-called “ransomware” is now being sent to people’s phones along with child pornography. Owners are unable to delete the images. The message says it can make the images go away for a price.

The scare tactic often works because people are too afraid to go to police.

“How am I going to explain this on my phone and come up with the story of, hey, somebody took over my phone and planted these images,” Watkins said.

The virus asks victims to pay with a Green Dot MoneyPak card, making it difficult to track down and prosecute the scammers.

“A lot of times, these people are in those jurisdictions or areas where we don’t have extradition treaties with them to extradite folks in violation of this,” Watkins said.

Police said victims should not pay as there’s no guarantee the hackers will unlock your phone. Watkins said the scammers also already have all of your personal information.

“It listed the item number on the phone, the make, model, ESN number for the phone, the contact number listed for her mother,” he said.

Coffee County investigators have contacted the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the phone companies, who said they have never heard of this before. They are working to learn as much as possible.

“It’s terrifying,” Watkins said. “We’re a technological world now. We depend too much on basic technology and it’s vulnerable.”

If caught, the scammers will not only face charges for extortion, but also for distributing child pornography.

In this case, the victim was a 12-year-old girl. She saw the disturbing images. She said she was watching a music video on YouTube and walked away. When she came back, she found the message.

Investigators said to avoid falling victim, keep your phone settings so that data cannot be downloaded without your permission."

The USS Sampson has been encountering choppy waves two- to four-foot high and 15- to 20-knot winds in the sea.

The AirAsia Flight, carrying 162 people from Surabaya to Singapore, disappeared on Sunday. Debris from the flight was located in the sea on Tuesday.

Seven bodies have been retrieved so far, but bad weather has been hindering further salvage efforts.

Hundreds of people, including children, attended the vigil in Surabaya Wednesday evening.

Surabaya's Mayor Tri Rismaharini said: ""Let us pray for the grieving families of those on board the plane. Let us pray this will be the last tragedy for Surabaya.""

All New Year's Eve celebrations in the East Java province were cancelled.

Rescuers say they believe to have found the plane on the sea floor off Borneo, after sonar detected a large, dark object beneath waters near where debris and bodies were found on the surface.

Indonesian officials said a sonar image appeared to show the body of an aircraft on the sea floor, but said it appeared to show an airplane upside down, about 80 feet underwater.

The black box flight data and cockpit voice recorder have yet to be found.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo said his priority was retrieving the bodies.

In a related report, Reuters says that radar data being examined by investigators appeared to show that AirAsia Flight QZ8501 made an ""unbelievably"" steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the Airbus A320's limits.

The data was transmitted before the aircraft disappeared from the screens of air traffic controllers in Jakarta on Sunday, according to a source, who declined to be identified, said Reuters.

""So far, the numbers taken by the radar are unbelievably high. This rate of climb is very high, too high. It appears to be beyond the performance envelope of the aircraft,"" he said.

An image that was reportedly leaked from AirNav Indonesia, which manages the country's air space, and shared on several websites, appeared to show QZ8501 at an altitude of 36,300 feet and climbing at a speed of 353 knots.

The source declined to confirm if that image was accurate. Officials from AirNav Indonesia declined to comment.

Two veteran pilots told Reuters that, if accurate, the image and information released so far pointed to the fact that the aircraft may have climbed suddenly and then lost speed.

This can result in the aircraft stalling in mid-air before plunging to the sea, they said."
948|Man built snow cave to survive 2 nights in Logan Canyon|"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A snowmobiler from Arizona who survived two nights in a remote northern Utah canyon built a snow cave and used pieces of his snowmobile to protect him from the cold. But he said in an interview Tuesday that he had little to drink after his bottles of Gatorade froze solid.

Lawrence Orduno's snowmobile got stuck Saturday evening after he and a friend were separated while riding in the Franklin Basin area near Logan. The 48-year-old from Phoenix tried to dig the machine out for about 30 minutes.

""It was just too deep in the snow, standing straight up and down,"" Orduno told the Associated Press.

His truck was about 8 miles away, but walking through the chest-deep snow drifts with dark quickly approaching was out of the question. He decided to hunker down for the night.

Orduno accidently left his food behind in the truck that day, and thought he'd lost his cigarette lighter. But as he shook out his pants to remove caked snow just before dark, the lighter appeared, caught in the bottom of his pant leg.

He shaped the snow around him into a cave-like shelter and used the side covers from his snowmobile to help protect him from the wind, then collected wood and built a small fire. He crushed his two frozen bottles of Gatorade to free some ice and stay hydrated, but it wasn't much.

Orduno is an avid snowmobiler who had been riding in the area before, and he went out with a 27-year-old friend while visiting his mother, who lives in the area.

Orduno said he got stuck in Boss Canyon, which off the beaten path but just over a ridge from more popular snowmobiling areas. He heard a machine go by at one point, but he couldn't flag it down.

Meanwhile, a search party led by the Cache County Sheriff's Office was combing the area for him, but the group was stymied by heavy snow.

Orduno says he started to worry the second night and considered taking more desperate measures, including setting his machine on fire.

But about 10 a.m. the next day, searchers taking a slightly different path spotted him.

""My story is really just another story of a guy out in the snow getting stuck,"" he said.

Orduno said he's grateful to the dozens of people who joined the search.

""I have no way of knowing all the people,"" he said. ""I just want to tell them all thank you for all of their help."""

Col. Peters criticized the president for taking credit when things go well, yet never taking responsibility for anything that is going wrong.

“He’s amazing. He applauds himself for all that’s going right in the economy, all that’s going right in the world and he avoids everything that’s going wrong.”

Peters continues to blame the state of international affairs on the ineffectiveness of this president and his administration.

“The strategic landscape from Nigeria to Pakistan, from Russia to Venezuela is almost immeasurably worse than it was when Obama took office.”

Peters added that NPR’s Steve Inskeep’s “slavish interview” failed to press Obama on any of the “hard stuff” and sounded like a Russian journalist interviewing Putin.

951|Ambac Sues Bank Of America Over Countrywide Mortgage Bonds|"By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ambac Assurance Corp sued Bank of America Corp to recoup hundreds of millions of dollars of losses from insuring roughly $1.68 billion of securities backed at least in part by risky mortgages from the bank's Countrywide Home Loans unit.

In a complaint filed on Tuesday in a New York state court in Manhattan, Ambac accused Countrywide of lying about how well it underwrote so-called ""pay option adjustable-rate mortgage negative amortization"" loans that backed the securities.

The securities were issued in eight transactions between 2005 and 2007, Ambac said.

Ambac said it faced potential claims exceeding $600 million as of Oct. 31 and that pools of loans supporting its insured certificates had suffered $3.07 billion of losses by Nov. 30. It also said it would have never guaranteed payments had it known of Countrywide's deception.

""Countrywide's fraud is borne out by the transactions' dismal performance,"" Ambac said.

Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, bought Countrywide in July 2008. It did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. Ambac Assurance is part of Ambac Financial Group Inc.

The lawsuit shows how Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America might still face legal liability over shoddy mortgage practices predating the 2008 financial crisis, even after agreeing in August with federal and state authorities to pay a record $16.65 billion penalty to settle civil fraud charges.

Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said at a Nov. 12 conference that the bank's major regulatory and litigation costs tied to the financial crisis, including the purchases of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch & Co, were ""largely behind us.""

Ambac filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2010 and emerged from bankruptcy 2-1/2 years later.

On Dec. 23, the New York-based company said Co-Chairman Nader Tavakoli would become interim chief executive officer on Jan. 1. He will replace Diana Adams, who is resigning ""by mutual agreement"" with the board after 3-1/2 years as CEO, Ambac said.

The case is Ambac Assurance Corp et al v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 653979/2014.

952|Overbilling in three months: Nepra chief sees ''some other factors''|"Overbilling in three months: Nepra chief sees ''some other factors''

Chairman National Electric Power Regulatory Authority Brigadier Tariq Sadozai (retired) on Wednesday stated that ""some other factors"", in addition to slabs'' change, are behind overbilling in June, July and August 2014. Briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Water and Power, headed by Senator Zahid, Khan, the newly-appointed Nepra chief said that the regulator had approved Discos tariffs in FY 2010-11 but the government notified it in October 2013 after the Supreme Court of Pakistan abolished schedule -II.



""Government notified Nepra''s determined tariff after almost three years starting from October 2013 but the impact of new slabs was negligible on tariff in November, December 2013 and January to May 2014. The committee should investigate why all of a sudden consumers'' tariff increased in June, July and August 2014,"" he added. The committee maintained that the government over-billed consumers by Rs 70 billion in three months. Some officials informally pointed fingers at the Finance Ministry which allegedly tailored this plan. However, Nepra representatives present in the meeting were not ready to say anything on record on tariff manipulation.



Although, Chairman Nepra who has been involved with the power sector for the last 9 years showed his lack of understanding of how the sector operates. Chairman Nepra stated that Nepra determines tariff on the basis of data provided to it by the CPPA and it is the government that decides the amount of a subsidy.



Commenting on the imposition of 60 paisa per unit surcharge, Additional Secretary Ministry of Water and Power, Omar Rasool insisted that Nepra determined fuel price adjustment (FPA) is in accordance with prevalent rules but the government is empowered to impose a surcharge to lower the volume of subsidy being given to consumers. Senator Nawabzada Saifullah Magsi, Senator Nisar Muhamand and Senator Mrs Khalida Parveen grilled the officials of Water and Power Ministry and Nepra on the issue of overbilling.



After hectic deliberations, the committee declared overbilling illegal and recommended that Nepra should restore tariff slabs prior to the position of 2010-11 and adjust the over- charged amount. Documents presented by the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) to the committee disclosed that GoP is extending a subsidy to consumers in the following manner: 1-50 units - Rs 2 per unit, 1-100 units - Rs 9.21 per unit, 101-200 units - Rs 9.13 per unit, 201-300 units - Rs 5.15 per unit, 301-700 units - Rs 2.50 per unit and 701- above - Rs 2.50 per unit.



According to Hesco, in the billing months of July and August 2013 the rate of domestic tariff slab of 101-300 was Rs 8.11 per unit while it was bifurcated into two slabs - 101 to 200 and 200-300 units per month. All slabs admissible in previous tariff have been withdrawn and only one previous slab benefit was allowed from October 2013.



During a discussion on Golan Gol Hydropower Project, Chairman Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) Zafar Mehmood assured the committee that the entire team deputed on the project is being replaced to expedite work. He also assured the committee that action will be taken against the official who misbehaved with Senator Nisar Muhmand during the latter''s site visit. Member Water (Wapda) apprised the committee that work on the project will restart after an international team arrives on January 2014. He said issues related to wielding size, etc, have already been sorted out. Chairman Wapda appreciated the inquiry report by Senator Nisar Mohmand on issues related to Golan Gol Hydropower Project.



Giving briefing on Naulang Dam in Jhal Magsi, Chairman Wapda said that fresh bids are being invited for the project on the basis of a revised PC-I at a cost of Rs 22 billion. He argued that M/s Descon had submitted a bid of Rs 28 billion against a revised PC-I of Rs 18 billion approved by ECNEC in 2012 but the Planning, Development and Reforms Division did not allow cost escalation of more than 15 per cent. Since Planning Commission does not allow a more than 15 per cent cost over-run from the PC-I, Wapda has decided to submit a revised PC-I. Nawabzada Saif Ullah Magsi urged Wapda to complete all codal formalities so that construction of dam can commence.



Chairman Standing Committee observed that the government is not giving full attention to hydropower projects which are not only source of cheap electricity; but these also mitigate chances of losses in floods. Chairman Wapda acknowledged that timely provision and release of funds is necessary for every project and most of the issues have been resolved. He said funds have been released for Munda Dam with the help of Planning Commission.



He further stated that funds are being arranged from Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project and Dasu Dam. Additional Secretary Economic Affairs Division (EAD) informed the committee that negotiations with different donors are under way for hydropower projects, and EAD is hopeful that funds will be made available to all the projects. Chairman Wapda also requested the committee that Planning Commission''s officials should be summoned to the next meeting of the committee so that Rs 4 billion funds for Darwat Dam in Sindh should be released.

Information from Fort Myers Police Department:

On December 30, 2014 at 10:50 a.m. Officer Chris Reiman and Officer Chris Scavo were conducting traffic enforcement in the area of Colonial Boulevard and Rolfes Road when they spotted the driver of a vehicle who was unbelted. Officers conducted a traffic stop for the seat belt violation and while walking up to the vehicle they observed the driver making suspicious movements toward the floorboard.

""After obtaining the mandatory approval from the chief minister on fax from London, the law department has issued a notification for constituting the 12th state legislative assembly that supersedes the 11th legislative assembly which was scheduled to complete its term Jan 20, 2015,"" a senior official of the state law department told IANS.

The notification was issued late Tuesday.

Under the state constitution, the assembly has to be constituted by the state law department, while in other states, the notification about constituting assemblies is issued by the election commission of India.

Jammu and Kashmir has its own constitution which is applicable to the state concomitantly with the Indian constitution.

The senior law department official said the new legislators will take oath after the next government is formed and the governor will appoint a pro-tem speaker who will administer oath of office to the new legislators.

The 12th state assembly has 87-members - 28 from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), 25 from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), 15 from the National Conference (NC) and 12 from the Congress. Seven independents have also won elections.

PDP president Mehbooba Mufti will meet Governor N.N. Vohra Wednesday to discuss possibilities of the next government in the state, while BJP general secretary Ram Madhav met the governor Tuesday.

State BJP president Jugul Kishore will also meet the governor separately for discussions Wednesday.

Since no single party could get a simple majority of 44 to form government on its own, negotiations are on between the PDP and the BJP to stitch a ruling coalition in the state.

955|Do You Have The Confidence in How You Look: Remember Details Matter|"WASHINGTON -- Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, a subsidiary of The Mosaic Company, has reached around $2 billion settlements with federal and state environmental agencies to resolve charges of mismanagement of onsite waste materials at its fertilizer manufacturing facilities in Florida and Louisiana.



Announcing the settlements, which are subject to court approval, the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Thursday said Mosaic Fertilizer has committed to ensure the proper treatment, storage and disposal of an estimated 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste at six Mosaic facilities in Florida and two in Louisiana.



The settlement resolves a series of alleged violations by Mosaic of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which provides universal guidelines for how hazardous waste must be stored, handled and disposed.



The 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste addressed in this case is the largest ever covered by a federal or state RCRA settlement and will ensure that wastewater at Mosaic's facilities is properly managed and does not pose a threat to groundwater resources.



At Mosaic's eight facilities in Florida and Louisiana, hazardous waste from fertilizer production is currently stored in large piles, tanks, ditches and ponds. The piles are as high as 500 feet and cover more than 600 acres, making them some of the largest manmade waste piles in the United States.



The piles can also contain several billion gallons of highly acidic wastewater, which can threaten human health and cause severe environmental damage if it reaches groundwater or local waterways.



Under the settlement, Mosaic Fertilizer will establish a $630 million trust fund, which will be invested until it reaches full funding of $1.8 billion.



These funds will cover the future closure of four Mosaic facilitiesthe Bartow, New Wales and Riverview plants in Florida and the Uncle Sam plant in Louisianaand also be put toward the treatment of hazardous wastewater at and long-term care of those facilities and two additional facilities which are already undergoing closure.



Mosaic Fertilizer's parent company, which is one of the largest fertilizer maker, will provide financial guarantees for this work. The settlement also requires Mosaic Fertilizer to submit a $50 million letter of credit.



Mosaic has committed to spend $170 million on projects to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing and waste management programs at its facilities and $2.2 million on two local environmental projects.



Mosaic will also pay a $5 million civil penalty to the United States, $1.55 million to the State of Louisiana and $1.45 million to the State of Florida, who joined the Department of Justice and EPA as plaintiffs in this case.



""This settlement represents our most significant enforcement action in the mining and mineral processing arena, and will have a significant impact on bringing all Mosaic facilities into compliance with the law,"" said Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division in a statement.



""Moreover, through this settlement, we establish critical financial assurance to cover the enormous closure and care costs at all these facilities. This sets the standard for our continuing enforcement of RCRA in the entire phosphoric acid industry. And, it reflects our emphasis on working jointly with impacted states.""



The alleged violations in this case stem from storage and disposal of waste from the production of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, key components of fertilizers, at Mosaic's facilities in Bartow, Lithia, Mulberry and Riverview, Florida, and St. James and Uncle Sam, Louisiana.



At all these units Mosaic failed to properly treat, store, and dispose of hazardous waste, and also failed provide adequate financial assurance for closure of its facilities.



""This case is a major victory for clean water, public health and communities across Florida and Louisiana,"" said Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles for EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.



Mosaic produces phosphorus-based fertilizer that is commonly applied to corn, wheat and other crops across the country. Sulfuric acid is used to extract phosphorus from mined rock, which produces large quantities of a solid material called phosphogypsum and wastewater that contains high levels of acid.



EPA inspections revealed that Mosaic was mixing certain types of highly-corrosive substances from its fertilizer operations, which qualify as hazardous waste, with the phosphogypsum and wastewater from mineral processing, which is a violation of federal and state hazardous waste laws.



As part of EPA's National Enforcement Initiative for mining and mineral processing, the agency has required phosphate fertilizer production facilities to reduce the storage volumes of hazardous wastewaters, ensure that waste piles and ponds have environmentally-protective barriers installed and verify the structural stability of waste piles and ponds.



Mosaic has committed to spending approximately $170 million over the next several years to implement an innovative reconfiguration of their current operations and waste management systems.



Under the settlement, Mosaic will also fund a $1.2 million environmental project in Florida to mitigate and prevent certain potential environmental impacts associated with an orphaned industrial property located in Mulberry, Florida. In Louisiana, Mosaic will spend $1 million to fund studies regarding statewide water quality issues.



Commenting on the settlement, Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Mosaic Company, said, ""We are pleased to be bringing this matter to a close.""



""In the years since EPA began this enforcement initiative, Mosaic has voluntarily made a number of major improvements to and significant capital investments in our facilities to enhance environmental performance, and the settlements will build upon that good work,"" added O'Rourke."

By Bay City News Service:

AAA Northern California is offering a free “tipsy tow” service on New Year’s Eve for those who end up celebrating the holiday with too much alcohol.

The service is open to all Bay Area drivers regardless of AAA membership, but reservations are not available.

From 6 p.m. New Year’s Eve to 6 a.m. New Year’s Day, drivers who have been drinking can call (800) 222-4357 (AAA-HELP) and ask for a tipsy tow and dispatchers will send a tow truck to their location.

The service includes a one-way ride for the driver and vehicle to the driver’s home, up to 10 miles away from the point of pick-up. Additional passengers, however, will be accommodated only if the there is room in the tow truck.

AAA estimates that DUI convictions for first-time offenders in California can cost up to $12,000 in fines, legal expenses, and increased insurance costs.

Drunk driving crashes represent roughly 36 percent of highway deaths for young people ages 16 to 24, according to 2008 statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

961|Apple Patents Digitizing 'Smart Pen'|"Apple Patents Digitizing 'Smart Pen'

Just as computers didn't mean the death knell for paper, multi-touch screens haven't made pens and pencils obsolete. Even the stylus-eschewing Apple appears to have acknowledged that with the patenting this week of a ""smart pen"" that can capture physical writing in e-form.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday granted Apple a patent for what it called a ""communicating stylus."" Invented by then-Apple-employee Aleksandar Pance, the stylus can be used to write on any type of surface, with the written images either stored for later use or immediately sent to a computer, tablet or other device for digital display.

As the Patent Office notes in its background comments, most styli used for sending data to an electronic device require the user to ""write on a specialized surface."" By contrast, Apple's stylus -- which has already been widely described as, of course, an iPen -- uses accelerometers to ""track the position and relative motion"" of the tip, enabling it to be used on any kind of surface or even in the air.

'Nobody Wants a Stylus'

Beyond the unique design of the stylus itself, Apple's latest patent is noteworthy for two other reasons: one, the application for the patent was filed almost five years ago, on Jan. 6, 2010; and two, late Apple founder Steve Jobs despised styli.

Upon unveiling the first-ever iPhone at Macworld 2007, Jobs led into his introduction of Apple's multi-touch screen technology with a pointed jab at the concept of a stylus.

""Who wants a stylus?"" Jobs asked the audience. ""You have to get 'em and put 'em away and you lose 'em...yuck! Nobody wants a stylus.""

Digital Pen Competition

As described by the Patent Office, the newly patented Apple stylus can either store the output of physical writing or drawing motions as position data for later output, or can be transmitted to an associated computing device. That transmission can take place continuously or in bursts, according to the user's needs and specifications.

The pen tip could be any shape or material, supporting -- for example -- a ballpoint, a graphite tip or felt brush. Users could either manually activate the pen, or have it automatically activated by removing it from its dock, picking it up or pressing it to a writing surface.

While it's uncertain whether Apple will ever actually manufacture its smart pen for commercial distribution, many similar devices are already on the market. For example, the Oakland-based Livescribe -- founded, ironically, in 2007, the year that Jobs unveiled the iPhone -- produces several styles of digital pens, although these use an embedded camera to detect pen motion and require the use of a special type of paper. Several other brands of smart pens support writing on any kind of surface."

Wednesday 31/12/2014

Nirupa Siwan

Fifteen street beggars would be identified to be trained and assisted in Fiji’s first rehabilitation centre that is being built in Colo-I- Suva.

This was highlighted by the Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, Rosy Akbar during her visit to the centre yesterday.

Akbar said that her Ministry now has a great task of changing the mindset of people to leave the streets and join the Centre.

She said during their profiling exercise, they found out that some beggars are generational beggars, so getting them embrace an independent life would be challenging.

Government has allocated $100,000 for the project.

The new rehabilitation center will be officially opened next month."
963|2014 On Course To Be Britain's Hottest Ever Year Since Records Began|"2014 is set officially become Britain's hottest year in history, thanks to global warming ""substantially increasing"" the chances of new temperature highs, weather experts have said.

The UK's average temperature is expected to be 9.9C this year - the warmest in records that date back to 1910 and beating the previous highest of 9.7C set in 2006, according to the Met Office.

It means that the UK's top eight warmest years have been recorded since 2002.

It might be hard to remember amid these freezing temperatures but this summer was the warmest recorded in seven years.

2014 is also set to be the hottest on record in the Central England Temperature (CET) series, which has recorded temperatures in an area of England since 1659 and is the longest-running record of instrumental temperature measurements in the world.

By that measure, the average temperature is expected to be 11C, which would beat the previous record of 10.9C set in 2006.

The Met Office said that while there had been no ""record-breaking"" individual months for temperatures, every month, except August, had been warmer than average.

A spokesman said: ""Although individual months were unremarkable, it was the persistence of the warmth that was unusual and together they add up to something record-breaking.

""Human influence on the climate is likely to have substantially increased the chance of breaking the UK and CET temperature records.

It's a distant memory but this is what summer this year looked like

""Estimates from the Met Office suggest that it has become about 10 times more likely for the UK record to be broken as a result of human influence on the climate.""

The Met Office used temperature figures from January to December 28, and assumed average weather conditions for the final three days of the year.

It has also been notably wet in 2014, after the UK recorded its fifth wettest year since records dating back to 1910.

Some 50.8in of rain fell up to December 28 - just 0.2in short of the fourth wettest year in 2008 but with three days of the year remaining.

The Met Office said the winter of 2013/2014 was the UK's wettest in records since 1910, and in the long-running England and Wales precipitation series from 1766.

May, August, October and November were also wetter than average, while August was especially wet in northern Scotland.

The remaining months were mostly drier than average, with September the driest on record since 1910 with just 22.1mm of rain.

Gravesend in Kent recorded the UK's highest temperature of the year after the mercury soared to 32.3C on July 18.

Cromdale, in Moray, Scotland saw the lowest temperature of -9C on December 27. However the Met Office said this was ""unusually mild"" as temperatures usually fall below -10 °C and often -15 °C.

The highest wind of 109mph was recorded at the Needles, Old Battery, on the Isle of Wight, on February 14.

Meanwhile, Ennerdale in Cumbria saw the UK's wettest day in 2014 after 5.78in of rain fell on March 6."

JERUSALEM (AP)  The spiritual leader of the African Hebrew Israelites, a polygamous vegan group that believes some black Americans descended from a Jewish tribe, has died aged 75.

Ben Ammi Ben Israel died Saturday, the group announced on Sunday. He was born Ben Carter in Chicago in 1939.

He maintained that some black Americans descend from the tribe of Judah, who migrated to Africa after the destruction of the Second Jewish Temple in A.D. 70.

Indiana diocese wants ex-teacher's jury award cut

FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP)  A northern Indiana Roman Catholic diocese wants to reduce a jury's nearly $2 million award to a former teacher fired by church officials for trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization.

A motion filed Monday by the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend seeks to cut Emily Herx's federal jury award to about $300,000, arguing that such damages are partly capped by the size of the diocese's workforce.

The Journal Gazette reports (http://bit.ly/1AhQ7jW ) diocese attorneys argue state law caps pain-and-suffering damages at $300,000 for employers with more than 500 employees and states that the diocese has more than 870 teachers alone.

Herx's attorneys filed a motion Monday seeking more than $560,000 in damages.

A jury awarded Herx $1.9 million on Dec. 19 after finding that diocese officials discriminated against her.

'In God We Trust' signs now hang in Kentucky Capitol

FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP)  Kentucky lawmakers will debate legislation in committees next year beneath ""In God We Trust"" signs.

The Lexington Herald-Leader reports (http://bit.ly/1zmLtwP) state officials hung the new signs in 11 committee rooms in the Capitol and Capitol Annex, where legislators have offices and meeting rooms. Republican Senate President Robert Stivers said the signs were paid for with private donations, not taxpayer dollars.

The ACLU of Kentucky and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State are not happy about the signs, but say there is little chance a judge would order them removed.

Legislators approved the signs earlier this year by passing an amendment sponsored by Republican state Sen. Albert Robinson of London. Similar signs already hang in the state House and Senate chambers.

Extremists kill 2 Muslim clerics in Uganda

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP)  A police official says an extremist group is responsible for killing two Uganda Muslim clerics days apart.

Ugandan police chief Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura said Tuesday the clerics had refused to cooperate with the Allied Democratic Forces, a Uganda extremist group based in Congo.

The clerics were separately shot dead by armed men who used motorbikes to run away after killing the victims.

Sheikh Abdu Kadir Muwaya, head of the Shia Muslim Community in Uganda, was killed on Dec. 23 at his home in Mayuge, about 74 miles east of Kampala. Sheikh Mustafa Bahiiga, a Muslim scholar and the head of Tablig Muslim sect in Kampala district was assassinated Sunday night in the outskirts of Kampala.

In 2012, five clerics were assassinated and police also linked these killings to ADF.

Egypt court bans festival honoring Moroccan rabbi

CAIRO (AP)  An Egyptian court has banned an annual festival in honor of Moroccan rabbi that was regularly attended by hundreds of Jewish pilgrims, mainly from Israel and Morocco.

After the 1979 peace treaty with Israel, Egypt began allowing organized trips to the tomb of Yaakov Abu Hatzira in the Nile Delta north of Cairo. The Culture Ministry declared the site an Egyptian monument.

The Administrative Court of Alexandria on Monday banned the visits and stripped the ministry's designation. It acted on a complaint filed by local residents who objected to the mingling of men and women and the consumption of alcohol at the festival."

A Sumrall woman and her family are grieving after learning that their dog along with another community dog had been shot and killed, and dumped on the side of the road.

Falisa Bourgeios and her family were celebrating Christmas at her parents house Friday afternoon. She said Boxer Ester, a community dog they called Rusty, and her father's dog Joe were all in the front yard when they were last seen.

""The dogs were outside playing, which is not unusual,"" said Bourgeious. ""Around 5 p.m. I came out to go to Sumrall and I noticed they weren't in the yard.""

When she got back an hour later the dogs were still no where to be found. Bourgeios said this was very unusual for her dog to wander off.

""She rode in the car with me, she was with me all the time.

Sunday evening Bourgeios saw a Facebook post with a picture of two dead dogs found shot to death and tied up together about 12 miles from her home on Nobles Road.

""When I saw the picture I just knew it was my dog,"" said Bourgeios.

The Hub City Humane Society was notified about the dogs and early Monday morning they went to find them.

""We didn't find them right away, we just found a sack they had been covered with,"" said Virginia Cheatham, H.C.H.S. manager. ""We went a little ways into the woods and that's where we found them.""

Bourgeios's dog had been adopted from the Southern Pines Animal Shelter in Hattiesburg and was micro-chipped. Because of this, they were able to track her down and let her know they had the dogs. She picked up their bodies, and buried them in her front yard.

Bourgeios said she contacted the Lamar County Sheriff's Department to see if they could help find out who killed her dogs.

""I was in a horrible state, crying my eyes out for days .I talked with a deputy and he was friendly and nice, but he told me there was not much he could do,"" said Bourgeios.

Sheriff Rigel confirmed that without someone coming forward with information, there wasn't much they could do. He asked for anyone who has information about who would have done this to call dispatch at 601-794-8610.

968|From Green Berets to Harvard|"In the Marines: Weiss served as a scout and sniper platoon commander.

In the Army: After an inter-service transfer, Weiss went to the Special Forces Qualification Course at Fort Bragg before joining 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell, Kentucky where he served as a team leader.

After the military: He earned his MBA from Harvard Business School where he re-connected with a fellow veteran. The two started RallyPoint as a class project.

Q: What made you decide to join the military?

""I was going to college, and I wasn't feeling very challenged. I wasn't feeling engaged in what I was studying. I saw the opportunity to challenge myself, gain leadership skills, be able to gain new skill sets and also to serve.""

Q: Then what made you decide to get out?

""I never intended to join the military as a career. (But) I joined before 9/11, and then 9/11 happened, and I didn't think it was appropriate to get out of the military when things were ramping up. I deployed to Iraq as a Marine, (and) I deployed to Iraq as an Army Special Forces captain. I achieved everything I wanted to achieve - I led Marines, I led soldiers in combat. I feel like I really made my mark and was able to contribute and grow. I wasn't as motivated for what came after that. I think at that point I felt like I'd accomplished what I set out to do.""

Q: What about serving in the Marines and the Army prepared you for starting and running a business?

""Self-discipline, focus, understanding how to push yourself at the end of the day. No part of running a business is going to be as dangerous or filled with risk as some parts of the military (but) the ability to take things in stride and put things in perspective (is similar). When I was in the field, training, keeping accountability of your gear and keeping accountability of people, making sure that everything stays on track takes an incredible amount of continuous attention to detail. I think a lot of that translated to running a business.""

Q: Thinking back over your military career and your civilian career, what was your hardest day at work?

""When we lost one of our fellow captains in Iraq. His name was Ben Tiffner. He was one of the team leaders. He was killed by an IED. None of us had expected that. There was not a big battle, there was not a big confrontation, but driving through Baghdad, an EFP (explosively formed penetrator) went off and killed him.

Even right now, I still get a little emotional about it. I told (my team) that Ben was killed and that we would have a moment of silence for him and then we would have to continue with our mission to honor the sacrifice he made.

I think losing someone, losing a friend, was definitely the hardest day. No matter how difficult we have it here as a business - and and there's always challenges, especially as a startup - nothing is as challenging as losing somebody or somebody getting injured."""

972|Company's Appeal Could Take Months|"Uber has shut down operations in Spain -- at least for now.



The New York Times reports that in early December, Spain banned the mobile app that connects a car service with smartphone users following opposition from taxi associations and policy makers. A judge ruled that the San Francisco-based company's uberPOP car service did not comply with Spanish laws and caused unfair competition for taxi drivers.



In a legal ruling on Tuesday, the judge ordered that banks and telecommunications operators stop supporting Uber's services.



Uber said it has filed an appeal, but the process could take months.



Like Us on Facebook

""We will also collaborate with Spanish politicians to develop the modern framework needed to create a permanent home for Uber and the sharing economy,"" the company said in a blog post.



Uber, which is valued at about $40 billion, has endured legal problems around the world as it tries to expand, including taxi association protests and allegations the company does not meet national transportation rules.



The company has experienced temporary bans in Belgium and Germany, but judges in these countries allow the Web-based taxi app to continue accepting passengers while it appeals the rulings.



In April, Uber launched uberPOP in Spain, the ride-sharing platform to ""allow Spaniards to share their own vehicles with their peers to create more efficient cities.""



The company claims its uberPOP provides safe, convenient and affordable rides that help reduce drunk driving and provide transportation to underserved communities.



The ride-share app has experienced its share of bad press and serious issues worldwide. In the month of December, four Boston women were sexually assaulted while using the Uber car service, an Indian Uber driver was accused of raping a female passenger and the company gave a U.K. woman $31 in credit after she was sexually harassed by a driver.

973|Bungling of Virus Prompts Hiring of CDC Safety Chief|"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will hire a laboratory safety supervisor after an Ebola virus sample was mishandled last week, the third reported safety lapse with potentially dangerous pathogens at the agency’s labs in the past year.

The new position, posted nationally in November before the Ebola incident, is “under recruitment,” Barbara Reynolds, a CDC spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The safety chief will be responsible for identifying problems, creating plans to solve them and holding CDC labs “accountable for follow-up,” she said.

Scientists discovered Dec. 23 that a technician in one of the agency’s labs was exposed to what may have been live Ebola virus. In March, the CDC inadvertently shipped a deadly strain of avian flu to a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, and in June more than 80 CDC workers were potentially exposed to anthrax after a sample of the bacteria was mishandled, sparking congressional scrutiny of the agency and its director, Thomas Frieden, who pledged to improve safety measures.

“CDC has made many improvements in laboratory safety, and continues to do so,” Reynolds said in her e-mail. The agency announced in July it would create a single point of accountability for safety in the lab.

Reuters earlier yesterday reported the CDC’s plan to appoint a lab safety chief.

In the Ebola incident, a plate with material from an experiment involving the virus was sent from a high-security biosafety laboratory to a less-secure lab at the agency’s Atlanta campus, the CDC said in a Dec. 24 statement. Live Ebola virus requires the highest level of security with special equipment and handling, according to the agency’s rules.

Single Exposure

A lab technician who processed the material was the only person believed to be exposed to the virus, the CDC said. The person has no symptoms and will be monitored for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the virus. Fewer than a dozen people who entered the second, lower-security lab have been contacted “to make them aware” of the mishap, Reynolds said last week.

There have been more than 20,200 reported cases of Ebola this year, mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, with 7,905 deaths, the World Health Organization said today. There is no cure for the disease, spread through direct contact with body fluids.

Four people have been diagnosed with the disease in the U.S. this year, according to the CDC, and all but one recovered after intensive care in hospitals.

Other steps the CDC is taking to improve safety in its labs include requiring scientists to use “validated methods” to inactivate dangerous pathogens and to verify the sterility of any materials shipped out of CDC labs, Reynolds said."

They say you should start the New Year as you mean to go on, which for Kelly Brook clearly means back in David McIntosh's arms.

The model appears to have flown over to Sydney to spend New Year's Eve with her on/off beau David, who is coincidentally is also partying the night away in the Australian city.

Her choice of destination will come as no surprise since the couple, who called off their engagement this autumn amid rumours the muscleman had cheated, have had more make-ups and break-ups in recent weeks than it's possible to count.

Scroll down for video

Celebrating in style: Kelly Brook spent New Year's Eve with several female friends in Sydney, Australia... which just so happens to be where her on/off boyfriend David McIntosh is holidaying

And Kelly's decision to jet off across the world is perhaps also fuelled by the fact the pair are celebrating their one-year anniversary since they reportedly met at a New Year's Eve party at her London bar and restaurant Steam & Rye last year.

The 35-year-old beauty seems to have banished all evidence of David from her Instagram account, instead posting pictures of numerous female friends.

Sharing pictures from what appears to be a house party, Kelly added several enthusiastic captions like 'Happy New Year!!' and 'Sydney Girls!!'.

Goodbye, 2014! Kelly and her pals posed for a series of glamorous group shots and selfies at what appeared to be a house party

Wearing a modest red floral dress and chunky gold hoop earrings, the pretty brunette was one of the most conservatively dressed at the event.

Meanwhile, David is partying at nearby MVP nightclub, with the pair no doubt due to meet up afterwards.

Her outing comes after it was revealed that Kelly's autobiography Close Up only shifted 8,000 copies this year despite a heavy publicity campaign, compared to top-sellers like Lynda Bellingham: There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell You, which sold 265,000.

The muscular fitness fan posed for a series of pictures on his way down to the Sydney seafront, declaring himself so incredibly manly and ripped that even the sharks were too scared to make an appearance.

'Yes every thing seems to be correct here! No sharks today! They can smell my @devildawg testosterone levels, so understandably their pretty scared (sic)', he added.

The former Gladiators star is no doubt delighted to leave his girl drama back in the UK, where both his on/off girlfriend Kelly and recent fling Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace are fighting over him.

Reality star Aisleyne was distraught when she saw pictures of David spending the weekend with model Kelly just days after going on a date with her.

The officer was aboard a boat that was about to run aground at Avalon Harbor, said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Nicole Nishida.

He tried to jump ashore, but he missed.

Two other officers on the boat tried to rescue him, but he became pinned between the boat and the harbor rocks and was fatally injured.

“The conditions were so horrible, they were unable to go in after him,” Nishida said.

On Wednesday morning, as deputies searched for the body of the Harbor Patrol officer, they came across the body of another man.

The circumstances of the second death were not yet known, and neither men's identities was released.

Capt. John Kades of the Los Angeles County coroner's office confirmed that body had been retrieved from the water.

Nishida said Avalon Harbor looked like it had been struck by a hurricane.

It ""took a beating,"" Kades said. ""Boats were knocked loose.”

The storm Tuesday brought freezing temperatures and snow that stranded hundreds of motorists on mountain roads across Southern California. The snow level dropped to below 2,000 feet, dusting hillsides and High Desert communities.

AMHERST, Mass. (WWLP) – Amherst police suspect alcohol may have led a UMass student to enter a Main Street home and fall asleep in a bedroom where a child had been sleeping.

Police Lt. Ronald Young told 22News that Zachary J. Zeigler, 19, of Norfolk, Mass. faces charges including breaking and entering and trespassing following the incident early Saturday morning.

According to Young, police were called around 6:00 A.M. for a report of a stranger inside the house. Officers then found Zeigler sleeping in a bunk bed, inside a room where a minor child had been sleeping.

No one was hurt. Young says that police suspect Zeigler had been drinking, and that led to the break-in.

Zeigler is also being charged with disturbing the peace and being a minor in possession of alcohol. He is scheduled to be arraigned Monday at Eastern Hampshire District Court in Belchertown."
985|U.S. diplomat: No illusions about Cuba’s willingness to allow freedoms|"Hurricane Joaquin is causing flooding in lightly populated parts of the Bahamas as ""an extremely dangerous"" Category 4 storm, and could strengthen further, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

Joaquin is moving at only six kilometers per hour as it passes over the island chain, with sustained winds of 215 kph (125 mph) and winds reaching out 80 kilometers from the eye of the storm.

The National Hurricane Center says the storm is expected to speed up and turn north, toward the U.S., over the next day or so. Some further strengthening is possible on Friday.

It is the third hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic season.

Forecasters predicted storm surges of 1.5 to 3 meters (5 to 10 feet) in the central Bahamas, with up to 51 centimeters (20 inches) of rain in some areas.

San Salvador, Cat Island and Rum Cay were expected to experience the most significant effects before the storm shifts northward.





U.S. officials in states along the East Coast began preparations for the storm, which could possibly make landfall early next week, nearly three years after Superstorm Sandy devastated New York and New Jersey, killing more than 120 people and causing about $70 billion in property damage.

The storm could also affect U.S. military facilities in coastal Virginia as well as the major inland cities of Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia."
986|United Nations News Centre|"What is HDI?

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living.

Published by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the Index was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone.

The first Human Development Report in 1990 opened with the simply stated premise that has guided all subsequent reports: “People are the real wealth of a nation.” By backing up this assertion with an abundance of empirical data and a new way of thinking about and measuring development, the Report has had a profound impact on policies around the world.

The Human Development Report is translated into more than a dozen languages and launched in more than 100 countries annually. Its founder was Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq.

How does it work?

The Human Development Report Office strives to include as many UN member countries as possible in the Index. To include a country in the HDI, recent, reliable and comparable data for all three dimensions of the Index is needed. Statistics should ideally be available from the relevant international data agencies.

2014 human development rankings

The 2014 rankings remain unchanged from the previous year at both ends of the Index, with Norway, Australia and Switzerland in the lead and the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Niger rounding out the bottom.

The steepest declines in HDI values in 2014 occurred in Central African Republic, Libya and Syria, where ongoing conflict contributed to a drop in incomes.

987|Tunisia's Essebsi: The 88-year-old comeback kid|"Some Tunisians fear that President Beji Caid Essebsi and his Nidaa Tounes party represent less of a break with the old system, and more of a disguised return of the old guard, with an injection of Botox.

The 88-year-old has been prominent in politics for more than half a century, and has served under two autocratic rulers.

For a man who is way beyond retirement age, Mr Essebsi, who won a run-off vote on 21 December to become Tunisia's first freely elected president, boasts a surprising amount of energy and political ambition.

He is affable, jovial and confident.

During the election campaign, he highlighted his political experience.

Many of his supporters voted for him because they consider him a safe pair of hands in the presidential palace in Carthage, four years after the revolution which overthrew long-serving ruler Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.

Image caption Mr Essebi has won support from a cross-section of Tunisians

Image caption He won the first free presidential election in the North African state

Mr Essebsi was among the founding fathers of the Tunisian republic formed after independence from France in 1956, and served as interior minister in then-President Habib Bourguiba's government.

The late Mr Bourguiba is credited with wide-ranging social and economic reforms, but also stands accused of having established a repressive regime which cracked down on the opposition and guaranteed domination by a single party, the Rally for Constitutional Democracy (RCD), until the 2011 revolution.

'Torture'

For former judge Mokhtar Yahyaoui, it is hard to ignore that Mr Essebsi oversaw the establishment of a police state during his term as interior minister.

Later, he made a comeback under the Ben Ali regime as the speaker of what was widely regarded as a rubber-stamping parliament.

""He carries some responsibility for the repression and torture under the Bourguiba dictatorship,"" says Mr Yahyaoui, who knows Mr Essebsi personally.

He adds that Mr Essebsi failed to criticize the dictatorial practices of the two ex-rulers in public but acknowledges that he raised his concerns in private.

Supported by both trade unions and some business groups

Robert Parks, the director of the American Center for Maghreb Studies in the Algerian city of Oran, says that Mr Essebsi was a long-time advocate of political reforms.

""Under Bourguiba, he was considered an economic and political liberal,"" he argues.

""In 1971 Essebsi attempted to push Tunisia onto a pluralist pathway. That effort failed, and Essebsi was more or less in political exile until 1980.""

'Strangling justice'

The new president is regarded as a politically savvy and pragmatic tactician who managed to unite a largely fragmented secular opposition, under the umbrella of the newly formed Nidaa Tounes after the 2011 revolution.

The party secured the largest number of seats in parliament and is made up not only of prominent trade unionists and businessmen, but also includes members of the RCD, which was dissolved after Mr Ben Ali was ousted.

The newly elected leader of the Tunisian parliament, Mohamed Ennaceur, was the Minister of Communication Technologies from January 2010 to January 2011, when Mr Ben Ali was overthrown in a popular revolt.

Image caption Mr Bourguiba (L) was Tunisia's first post-independence leader

This has led Selim Ben Abdessalem, a prominent member of Nidaa Tounes, to quit the party.

""Nidaa Tounes is being dominated by members of the RCD - Ben Ali's party. I couldn't accept this. I didn't want to give legitimacy to these people and this party,"" he says.

""I am concerned that they will strangle justice, and especially the transitional justice process. Why should they have an interest in seeing the affairs of 23 years of Ben Ali coming to light?"" Mr Ben Abdessalem asks.

'Carrying dreams'

During the election campaign, Mr Essebsi called for a change to a law which requires an investigation into human rights abuses committed since the 1960s.

This was seen by his critics as an attempt to avoid a probe into his role as interior minister in the Bourguiba government.

In his first address to the nation after securing victory, Mr Essebsi tried to reassure his critics.

Image caption Tunisia's security forces have been accused of committing many atrocities

He vowed to respect the freedoms achieved after the 2011 revolution and promised to protect freedom of speech.

""We will not take any reporters to the courts, this I promise. There is no going back on press freedoms,"" he told national TV.

He went on to stress that he considered himself the president of all Tunisians, not just those who voted for him and Nidaa Tounes.

""Our values are democratic,"" says Mahmoud Ben Romdhane, a senior member of the party.

""We want to respond to the dreams of the Tunisian revolution. You have to judge our party based on our values and objectives. We reject the corruption that was at the core of the RCD, and we want to build a state based on the rule of law.""

Most analysts agree that it is difficult to predict the direction in which Mr Essebsi will take Tunisia.

Image caption Supporters of Tunisia's two most popular parties: Liberal Nidaa Tounes (L) and Islamist Ennahda (R)

In 2013, he called for the dissolution of the elected body meant to draw up a new constitution.

In the end, Mr Essebsi changed his mind and was instrumental in entering into talks with the then-governing Islamist Ennahda party, breaking the political deadlock which threatened Tunisia's stability.

""Mr Essebsi and his party have demonstrated that a political party can change its opinion and attitudes,"" says Meherzia Labidi, one of Ennahda's most senior members of parliament.

""I hope that both he and his party understand that whoever is governing Tunisia shall respect the constitution. It's the achievement of all Tunisian people,"" she adds.

Mr Yahyaoui, the former judge, describes the president as a ""very clear-thinking individual"".

""We have to see whether he is going to adapt the party to the new Tunisia, or whether the new Tunisia will have to adapt to the party,"" he adds."

Kondik, Weirton Police Chief Rob Alexander and Weirton Fire Chief Jerry Shumate. -- Photos by Shae Dalrymple

Kondik thanked Ward 3 Councilman Fred Marsh for his initiative in forming the committee that organized the event in just two weeks, describing him as an ""unsung hero"" for local police forces. He also recognized Ward 2 Councilman Chuck Wright, Ward 4 Councilman George Ash Sr., Ward 6 Councilwoman Angelina Dickson and Ward 7 Councilman Terry Weigel, who is also director of the city parks department.

Kondik donated a banner that was signed by guests of the memorial service to send to the NYPD.

Marsh lit a candle to begin the service as an offering of ""solace, hope, warmth, and eternal life"" for fallen police officers and firefighters.

""We gather tonight to remember the lives of police officers that were brutally assassinated by cowards while they were doing their regular duties on shift,"" Marsh said.

Speakers included Weirton Police Chief Rob Alexander, Brooke County Sheriff Chuck Jackson, Hancock County Sheriff Ralph Fletcher, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla, Wheeling Police Chief Shawn Schwertfeger and Weirton Fire Chief Jerry Shumate.

""They are heroes, not only because of how they died, but because of how they lived. Because of the courage they had shown during the last few moments of their lives,"" Alexander said of the officers in New York. ""This courage is not an unusual event but a daily one that each and every officer in this room and nationwide knows all too well... I want my brothers and sisters in blue to know that we appreciate everything that you do every day for your communities.""

Shumate spoke of the remorse, anger and frustration felt by public servants in the wake of violence targeting them.

""This was retaliation against public servants for doing their jobs, public servants who put their lives on the line every day... Now we have to worry about the danger of this retaliation. Every day when we report to duty and leave our families, in our minds we will wonder whether someone out there wants to take our lives. I really find a lot of anger in this, and I look to support the officers in their duty. I know as public servants we support each other daily,"" he said.

Fletcher described the extensive screening, background checks, examinations and training involved in becoming a police officer. He said he cringes at the phrase ""a few bad apples,"" because he's aware of the scrutiny placed on every police officer from the beginning to the end of his or her career.

""We do this to get us the best, most qualified persons available to protect our communities... I know that we do everything in our power to eliminate the possibility of 'bad apples,'"" Fletcher asserted.

Jackson said that in today's world there's very little appreciation for police officers, although he wasn't sure if that lack of appreciation is ""real or perceived."" He said the majority of people who remain quiet on the subject do support the police and pointed out that the media tends to focus on negative stories more than positive ones.

""I've always taught my officers to respect the people and they will respect you. Ninety-nine percent of the time that's true,"" Jackson said. ""I'm proud that I live in an area where law enforcement gets some respect.""

Schwertfeger said he was honored to visit Weirton for the event and agreed with Jackson that respect for law enforcement is still alive in the Ohio Valley.

""When I worked in Virginia there was not this kind of gratitude there; police officers were considered a necessary evil. I have received more favorable comments about what police officers and firefighters do since returning back to the Ohio Valley. It's a different breed of people here, and I appreciate that,"" Schwertfeger said. ""Officers risk much and sacrifice daily with little return... As we sleep at night they are patrolling your street, protecting your family. Please don't ever forget that.""

Abdalla reminded the audiences of violent acts against law enforcement and firefighters that occurred in this region over the years, noting that it can and has happened here before.

""I don't care what college you go to or what you intend to do with your life, whether it's a police officer or not, if you don't have compassion and common sense, you're in the wrong business,"" Abdalla said.

The service featured hymns sung by the Cove Presbyterian Church Choir and bagpipe selections played by Michael Lobbrick of the Wheeling Fire Department. The Color Guard of the Wheeling Police Department also participated."
991|Back-to-back Oscar winner Luise Rainer dies at 104|"(MENAFN - The Peninsula) Luise Rainer, the 1930s film star who won two Oscars in a row before turning her back on Hollywood, died Tuesday, her daughter said.



At 104, she was the oldest surviving Academy Award winner.



She passed away before dawn at her home in London, Francesca Knittel-Bowyer, her only child, told fans on her Twitter account.



She left with grace and peace after battling pneumonia, Bowyer added in an email to AFP.



She leaves her indelible print on her profession and all those who touched her. No doubt she is readying her entrance to heaven, and definitely to rearrange it.



Born in Germany into an affluent Jewish family, Rainer appeared in just 14 movies, collecting Academy Awards for her leading roles in the 1936 film The Great Ziegfeld and The Good Earth the following year when she was 28.



She was the first actor, male or female, ever to win two consecutive Oscars - a feat only matched by four others, including Katherine Hepburn.



But in an era when cigar-chomping studio moguls called the shots, Rainer chaffed at the fluffy roles thrust upon her by legendary MGM boss Louis Mayer after her double Oscar triumph.



He said, 'We made you and we are going to destroy you,' she told the Daily Telegraph newspaper in London shortly before her 100th birthday.



Well, he tried his best.



- Oscars gifted -



Briefly and unhappily wedded to US theatre director and screenwriter Clifford Odets, Rainer later enjoyed a happier marriage with British publisher Robert Knittel, who died in 1989.



Away from Hollywood, Rainer built a career in live theatre, appearing in plays in Britain and the United States.



From the 1950s she ventured into television drama, appearing in BBC productions and, in 1984, an episode of the popular US series The Love Boat.



One of her last film roles was in The Gambler, a 1997 drama by Hungarian director Karoly Makk, based on a Fyodor Dostoevsky novel.



Rainer returned to Hollywood for the 70th anniversary of the Academy Awards in 1998, saying If I don't show up they'll think I'm dead.



She lived in London for more than two decades, moving to the British capital from Switzerland - and giving her Oscar statuettes to the moving men.



The awards meant nothing because I considered the acting just a gift, she told the Washington Post in 1982.



They made my life so difficult, so clamorous."

993|Future of Iron Horse Inn back on Steamboat City Council's agenda|" The Steamboat Springs City Council will kick off the new year talking about what the city should do with its old Iron Horse Inn when all of the Sheraton Steamboat Resort employees move out of the hotel in the spring.

City staff Tuesday will look to the council to weigh in on the future of the property that hosted an empty hotel building for two years before it was rented out to the Sheraton for $18,000 per month as workforce housing in a tight rental market.

The discussion comes as the property continues to receive interest from potential buyers.

The council now has the option to sell or repurpose the property because it recently moved the collateral on the city's hefty Iron Horse debt from the hotel itself to the city's public works, animal shelter and transit facilities.

""Now we go back to the council to ask, 'What would you like to do?'"" said Anne Small, the city's director of general services.

Small said the Sheraton also has expressed some interest in possibly renting out the hotel again in the summer and next winter.

Before it was completely rented out, multiple developers were pursuing the Iron Horse.

An Alaska-based developer in 2013 offered the city $915,000 to purchase the hotel so he could renovate it into a successful lodging property.

A few months before that offer, a Chicago-based developer said he was in the early stages of forming a proposal to raze the existing hotel buildings and replace them with an affordable housing project.

City Manager Deb Hinsvark said at the time, the city also got inquiries from about seven other people regarding the Iron Horse.

City staff did not seriously consider the development proposals, saying they first would need an endorsement from City Council to sell the property and then a public process to allow interested parties to bid on it.

The council also was hesitant to consider the proposals at the time.

“This is a bigger discussion that needs to be on a future agenda,” council President Bart Kounovsky said in March 2013.

In her most recent City Council report, member Sonja Macys wrote that she talked to a man who was interested in purchasing the Iron Horse, and he asked if it was for sale.

""Is it?"" Macys asked her fellow council members and city staff.

The city purchased the Iron Horse in 2007 thinking it would be an ideal property to use as affordable workforce housing.

To pay off the outstanding debt on the property, it is estimated the city will continue to pay from its general fund between $470,000 and $480,000 annually through 2032.

While the hotel operations were ceased because of the cost to run it, the monthly rentals offered at the other hotel building on the property continue to be popular.

The future of the Iron Horse is one of three big discussions the council is scheduled to have Tuesday.

The council also will hear an update on the city's project to build a new police station and about sustainability efforts.

TRINIDAD Y TOBAGO: Rough seas continue, as fisherfolk seek Govt's help

Esta noticia ha sido leída 86 veces





News day / Speaking with Newsday yesterday afternoon, FFOS Corporate Secretary, Gary Aboud, said fisherfolk ""are hard-working people but not a single one of them in Trinidad and Tobago has ever been able to obtain insurance.







That's why FFOS Vice-President, Cecil McLean, made a public appeal to the Government for help.""







Aboud recalled that between 1995 - 2000, when the United National Congress (UNC) was in power and Reza Mohammed served as Agriculture Minister, ""we lobbied at great length to get insurance coverage; via a Stakeholder Committee whose membership comprised eight fisherfolk and ten Government agencies.""







""Sadly, that committee was disbanded when the PNM (People's National Movement) came into power and we are still trying to get insurance for fisherfolk,"" Aboud lamented.







He said that's why, although he does not believe in ""Government handouts, under these extraordinary circumstances, we are hoping the PM, Food Production Minister Devant Maharaj and the Minister of Land and Marine Resources Jairam Seemungal, will provide some financial assistance to affected fisherfolk in Las Cuevas.""







Aboud told Newsday that approximately 18 fisherfolk in Las Cuevas, located on Trinidad's north coast, lost equipment over the weekend. ""It amounts to a little over $500,000.""







Meanwhile, in its latest ""Rough Seas Bulletin,"" issued at 5.25 pm yesterday, the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service (Met Service) advised that sea conditions along the exposed coasts of Trinidad and Tobago ""continue to be moderate to rough. Wave heights are 2.5 to 3.0 metres along the exposed coastlines...attributed to relatively strong winds in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These strong winds are currently agitating surfaces of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea.""







These rough seas conditions are expected to persist for ""at least the next 24 to 48 hours, with wave heights in open waters reaching 2.5 to 3.0 metres near-shore for both islands, but occasionally reaching in excess of 3.0 metres offshore for the northeast exposed coasts of Trinidad and Tobago.""







Although wave heights in sheltered areas are below 1.0 metre, the Met Service said seas can become choppy at times. Additionally, conditions may become aggravated during high tides.







""The rough seas may lead to dangerous marine conditions, which will include localised disruption to sea bathing and sea travel by small crafts, as well as fishing boats. Fisher-folks and those living along the coast are warned of the possible occurrence of big waves associated with the system.







Small craft operators, sea bathers and all marine interests were again asked to ""exercise extreme caution in any sea-related activities"" by the Met Service.

996|Presidential support escalates wind boom in Chile|"The formerly sleepy pace of development in Chile's wind power market seems to have led to few people noticing what actually happened there last year. In the first nine months alone, Chile installed 382MW of wind capacity, tripling 2013's 130MW of new build, according to the state-run Renewable Energy Centre (CER). That brought the country's total wind power capacity to 737MW, more than double the 335MW cumulative figure at the end of 2013.

""We knew the take-off would come, and now it's finally happening,"" says Ramon Fiestas, chairman of the Global Wind Energy Association's (GWEC) Latin-American committee. Now GWEC and Chile's renewables trade body, Asociacion Chilena de Energias Renovables (Acera) expect a steady 300-400MW of new annual capacity to 2025.

""The annual figure is unlikely to go much beyond that,"" says Brian Gaylord of Make Consulting. The country might boast a healthy economic annual growth rate averaging 5.38% from 1987 to 2014, as well as enjoying good wind resources blowing in from its 4,000-kilometre Pacific coastline. But Chile is limited in size with a population of 18 million and current installed capacity from all generation sources of just 17.6GW.

Sun versus wind

Furthermore, solar PV, with 219MW online, is fast competing for space. CER identifies 160MW of wind projects under construction across the country, against 456MW of solar PV. A further 5.2GW of wind projects have environmental permits, topped cleanly by PV, with 7.8GW. Around 2.2GW of additional wind projects are under environmental assessment; solar PV has 2.5GW.

Given the current political and energy outlook, Carlos Finat, executive director of Acera, estimates the addition of 800MW new online renewable power annually to 2025, mainly from solar and wind capacity. ""Wind should cover 50% of that in the long run, providing it works to remain competitive,"" says Finat. While not an immediate threat, biomass and geothermal could also get a boost in the future and eat into wind's share of the market, he adds.

Meanwhile, Chile's wind sector is humming, led mainly by foreign turbine makers and developers. Spanish turbine manufacturer Acciona brought online its 45MW Punta Palmeras wind project in the Coquimbo region last October, using its own 3MW machines. In August 2014 US utility Pattern Energy officially inaugurated the 115MW El Arrayan development, also in Coquimbo, using 2.3MW turbines from Germany's Siemens. This was a milestone for Chile, and one of the biggest wind farms in Latin America.

In the same month, Spain's Jealsa brought the 36MW San Pedro project online on the central-south island of Chiloe, using 2MW turbines from fellow Spanish firm Gamesa. Last October, Colombian utility Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM) commissioned another landmark wind project - its 109.6MW Los Cururos wind complex in Coquimbo, using 2MW turbines from Denmark's Vestas.

Commitment and stability

The main impulses behind the crank-up include the staying power of large developers, many of which recognised Chile's rich wind resources over a decade ago, as well as the country's political stability. A high electricity market price, hovering typically between $110 and $180/MWh offered good returns.

""Chile is our favourite nation,"" Pattern Energy CEO Michael Garland recently told Bloomberg. ""It's got a good economy, a stable political environment and it's a bit of an energy island with few indigenous energy resources.""

Chinese turbine manufacturer Envision, which brought online its 17.8MW Ucuquer project in the Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins region last September, has a similar verdict. ""Chile is probably the best Latin-American country in terms of business and regulation,"" says Envision executive director Felix Zhang.

And now, spurring on the incumbents and newcomers alike, president Michelle Bachelet has boosted political commitment to long-term energy planning. On taking office last March, Bachelet and her industry minister Maximo Pacheco unveiled their energy agenda, which aims to slash Chile's 65% primary energy dependency on fossil imports. It orders government agencies to lift barriers to clean energy, and demands 45% of new generation capacity be sourced to renewables 2014-2018 to help Chile's legally binding obligation. That obligation, passed into law in October 2013 by the former administration, demands distributors include a minimum of 20% of renewables in their mix by 2025.

Finally, Chile has what GWEC's Fiestas describes as ""a solid, long-term energy strategy"", succeeding its mainly improvised policy. In September 2014, the government consolidated that strategy with new rules for electricity supply tenders, permitting renewables to make special offers within three blocks of hours during the day: in blocks 2300- 0800hrs; 0800-1800hrs; and 1800-2300hrs.

Finat sees this as the end to power tender discrimination against wind, as it enables producers of variable generation to offer output at the optimum time. It is a game changer that ""will make renewables extremely competitive"", he says.

Acera is already seeing a large amount of offers from wind and solar for the current power tender in which a group of distributors across the country are making a combined call for 15-year supply contracts totalling 2,000GWh of new capacity for 2016. The results of that tender (announced in late December 2014, after this issue went to press) will indicate wind's immediate future. The crunch comes later, as the government is preparing a 20TWh tender - also for 15-year contracts - divided into separate calls, starting in March 2015.

Finat prefers not to hazard a price estimate for wind contracts in the coming calls. He points out, however, that in the last two, conventional power sold at $129/MWh and $112/MWh. Meanwhile, power auctions in Brazil have long seen wind prices fall well below $100/MWh, so far bottoming at $50.2/MWh.

Chile has no turbine manufacturers, which is unlikely to change given the restricted size of its market, says Gaylord. That might make installed wind power costs higher than in Brazil, with its large local wind industry. Yet Finat believes prices will enable wind to stand on its own feet competing with conventional power in the Chilean tenders.

Outstripping obligations

Based on recent experience, distributors will buy wind even in excess of the statutory renewables obligation, says Finat. Chile's current wind boom comes largely from past development momentum. That, says Finat, continues now, long after surpassing the previous government's renewable electricity obligation, which had scheduled 5% for 2014 (on its way to 10% to 2024). ""We are already at nearly 10%,"" he explains.

Chile has vast areas where wind capacity factors top 30%. But, until the new government's energy policy was implemented, there was little developer security to entice project financers. Developers staying the course over the past decade are mainly those with deep pockets, such as wind market leader Spanish utility Endesa, which is now controlled by Italian counterpart Enel. Another Chilean wind major, Ireland's Mainstream, sees the market as strategic and uses special financing strategies, such as partnering with Chinese turbine manufacturer Goldwind, which has a dedicated finance affiliate.

Up to now, successful wind operators have mainly sold power directly to the spot market, averaging prices at around $130/MWh. On a smaller scale, the more adventurous of Chile's mining groups have signed up for wind generation through long-term power purchase agreements (PPA), guided by the spot price. Yet PPAs are limited in number due to the conservative nature of Chile's power system, with large customers ""wanting the usual one-stop shop suppliers, without needing to integrate different solutions"", says Finat. Now, however, with the opening of distributor tenders to renewables, Finat believes Chile will surpass its 20% renewables target by 2020, five years ahead of deadline."
997|Dumb ways to die on Queensland roads this summer|"A driver was clocked at 165km/h in Gold Coast hinterland

IT seems some people are determined to die on Queensland roads this Christmas holiday break.

Police say one driver was clocked at 165km/h in a 100km zone on the Pacific Motorway at Worongary in the Gold Coast hinterland.

A driver on the Robina Parkway at Robina was also detected driving at 80km over the speed limit (150km in a 70km zone).

Police also impounded 36 vehicles across the state and one drink driver recorded a breath alcohol level of 0.327 per cent at Kin Kora.

Fifteen positive roadside drug tests were also recorded.

Excessive speeds in 60km zones were detected with a driver on Gympie Road, Kedron travelling at 108km an hour, a driver on Ruthven Street, Toowoomba speeding at 119klm an hour, and a Cairns driver travelling at 107km an hour on Kamerunga Road.

Police are clearly frustrated by the results.

""Road safety is a shared responsibility and while police across Queensland are out in force this festive season, motorist are reminded that they literally hold their lives, and the lives of other road users, in their hands,'' they said in a statement on Wednesday.

The Queensland Christmas Road Safety Campaign continues until 2359 hrs on Saturday, 3 January 2015.

This is part of a National Road Safety Operation entitled ""Operation Crossroads"".

During the Christmas Holiday Period, Queensland Police will enforce high risk road user behaviour including the fatal five: speeding, fatigue, impaired driving (drink and drug), failure to wear a seat belt and distraction/inattention in a concerted effort to minimise road trauma."
